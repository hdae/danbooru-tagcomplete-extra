It is most commonly worn on the torso and arm area of the body. Health and safety regulations often require the use of high visibility clothing as it is a form of personal protective equipment.[1][2][3] Many colors of high visibility vests are available, with yellow and orange being the most common examples. Colors other than yellow or orange may not provide adequate luminescence for conformity to standards such as ISO 20471.\r\n\r\nAs a form of personal protective equipment, high-visibility clothing is worn to increase a person's visibility and therefore prevent accidents caused by persons not being seen. As a result, it is often worn in occupations where hazardous situations are created by moving vehicles or low lighting conditions. These occupations include railway and road workers, airport workers and emergency services. Cyclists and motorcyclists may also use high-visibility clothing to increase their visibility when operating amongst motor traffic.[4] Hunters may be required to wear designated high-visibility clothing to prevent accidental shooting.

The four were summoned as heroes to save the country from periodic mass appearances of monsters, an event they refer to as a \"wave.\" Each was equipped with one of four legendary weapons: Sword, Bow, Spear, and Shield.\r\n\r\nFrom the onset Naofumi as the Hero of the Shield is treated differently from the other three, with people treating him coldly, spreading rumors about him, and refusing to group with him. His situation greatly worsens and he is shunned by nearly everyone when the only person who choose to group with him falsely accuses him of raping her. Outcasted, but unable to escape his situation, he eventually is convinced to purchase a slave to make up for his lack of offensive ability. Lacking proper funds he purchases a young demi-human girl named [[Raphtalia]].

The M113 was sent to [[United States Army]] Europe in 1961 to replace the mechanized infantry's M59 APCs. The M113 was first used in combat in April 1962 after the United States provided the South Vietnamese Army with heavy weaponry such as the M113, under the \"MACV\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Assistance_Command,_Vietnam] program. Eventually, the M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the [[Vietnam War]] and was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the [[jungle]] to attack and overrun enemy positions. It gained the nickname as the modern \"battle taxi\". \r\n\r\nThe M113 was the first aluminum hull [[military vehicle|combat vehicle]] to be put into mass production. Much lighter than earlier similar vehicles, its aluminum armor was designed to be thick enough to protect the crew and passengers against [[under fire|small arms fire]], but light enough that the vehicle was air transportable and moderately amphibious.\r\n\r\nThe APC's versatility spawned a wide variety of adaptations that live on worldwide and in U.S. service. It is estimated that over 80,000 vehicles in the M113 family have been produced and used by over 50 countries worldwide, making it one of the most widely used [[armored vehicle]]s of all time. The production was terminated in 2007.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n* [[List of Ground Vehicles]]\r\n\r\nh4.
