As in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in sight or gun range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier- or land-based aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal was underway with the Battle for Henderson Field while the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of 26 October 1942, just north of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the [[uss_hornet_(cv-8)|fleet carrier Hornet]] sunk, and another fleet carrier, Enterprise, heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses, plus significant damage to the fleet carrier Shōkaku and the light carrier Zuihō.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz was a short-term \"Pyrrhic victory\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, and control of the seas around [[guadalcanal_(island)|Guadalcanal]]. However, Japan's loss of many irreplaceable veteran aircrews proved to be a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low and were quickly replaced. The Japanese had hoped for, and needed, a larger, decisive [[victory]]. The fact that the naval battle was won just after the land battle was lost by the Japanese meant that the opportunity to exploit their success in the battle had already passed.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["南太平洋海戦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184353,"created_at":"2024-02-11T14:25:12.153-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T19:22:40.996-05:00","title":"para_(vtuber)_(3rd_costume)","body":"The third [[official alternate costume|costume]] of the [[Indie Virtual YouTuber|indie]] [[Para (vtuber)|]], debuting on February 9th, 2024 for her birthday celebration, as seen on \"Twitter\":[https://twitter.com/wwparasiVT/status/1757084126056771631].\r\n\r\nHer formerly [[long hair]] has been cut [[short hair|short]], and her bangs trimmed [[blunt bangs|straight]].\r\n\r\nShe now wears a [[white shirt|white]] [[blouse]] with an [[off shoulder]] [[pink sweater|sweater]] that reaches past her [[sleeves past wrists|wrists]], a [[red bow|red]] [[plaid]] [[bowtie]], a [[blue skirt|blue]] [[pleated skirt]], [[leg warmers]], and [[bunny slippers]] stylized to match herself.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184351,"created_at":"2024-02-11T13:11:49.356-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T19:22:39.167-05:00","title":"para_(vtuber)_(2nd_costume)","body":"The second [[official alternate costume|costume]] of the [[Indie Virtual YouTuber|indie]] [[Para (vtuber)|]], which debuted on October 28, 2023, as seen on \"Twitter\":[https://twitter.com/wwparasiVT/status/1718408767396556819].\r\n\r\nConsists of a [[white shirt]] with [[sleeves past fingers|sleeves]] past her fingers worn under a [[blue dress|blue]] [[denim]] dress with two [[buttons]] and an [[food print|image]] of a [[leek]]. \r\n\r\nShe now also has large [[backpack]] filled with various pieces of [[meat]] and a [[bone]] sticking out from it, she also added a pair of [[yellow footwear|yellow]] [[rubber boots|rain boots]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184387,"created_at":"2024-02-12T01:36:43.253-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T19:15:10.423-05:00","title":"tabinoki_kanae_(2nd_costume)","body":"The second [[official alternate costume|costume]] of the [[Indie Virtual YouTuber|indie]] [[Tabinoki Kanae]], as seen in post #7205636.\r\n\r\nFor this look, he wears a [[black headwear|black]] [[beret]], with [[black capelet|black]] [[fur-trimmed capelet]] worn over a [[black shirt]], [[black shorts|black]] [[suspender shorts]] and [[black footwear|black]] [[fur-trimmed boots]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":167913,"created_at":"2023-07-02T04:03:59.891-04:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T18:56:34.872-05:00","title":"shisui_kiki_(2nd_costume)","body":"The second [[official alternate costume|costume]] of [[Nanashi Inc.]]'s [[Shisui Kiki]], as seen on \"Twitter\":[https://twitter.com/Kiki_Shisui/status/1629523483276480512].\r\n\r\nShe retains her [[ahoge]] and [[cowlick]], but now has [[medium bangs|medium-length]] [[blunt bangs]] and a [[black headwear|black]] [[beret]].

The Tiger I design gave the Wehrmacht its first tank mounting the 88 mm gun, in its initial armored fighting vehicle-dedicated version, which in its [[88_flak|Flak version]] had previously demonstrated its effectiveness against both air and ground targets. During the course of the war, the Tiger I saw combat on all German battlefronts. It was usually deployed in independent tank battalions, which proved to be quite formidable. However, it was over-engineered and prone to mechanical breakdowns and faults, making it unreliable and causing many Tigers to be lost outside of combat. The overlapping wheel system in particular was extremely hard to perform field repairs on.\r\n\r\nThe tank was given its nickname \"Tiger\" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the later [[Tiger II]] entered production. The initial official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (‘Panzer VI version H’, abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H), but the tank was redesignated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. E in March 1943.

Traditionally, Guan Yu is portrayed as a red-faced warrior with a [[long beard]] wearing a [[green robe]] over his [[Chinese armor|body armor]]. Guan Yu's weapon was a [[guan dao]] named Green Dragon Crescent Blade, which resembled a [[glaive (polearm)|glaive]] and was said to weigh 82 catties (about 49.2 kg or 108.4674 lbs).\r\n\r\nAlong with [[Zhang Fei]], he shared a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and accompanied him on most of his early exploits. Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei's state of [[Shu Han]] during the [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms|Three Kingdoms period]]. While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei, he is also known for repaying [[Cao Cao|Cao Cao's]] kindness by slaying [[Yan Liang]], a general under Cao Cao's rival [[Yuan Shao]], at the Battle of Boma. After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214, Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years. In 219, while he was away fighting Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Fancheng, Liu Bei's ally [[Sun Quan]] broke the Sun–Liu alliance and sent his general [[Lu Meng|Lü Meng]] to conquer Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. By the time Guan Yu found out about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng, it was too late. He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan's forces and executed.\r\n\r\nGuan Yu's was deified during the [[Sui dynasty]]. His deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis, making Guan Yu one of East Asia's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness. He is still worshipped by many Chinese people today. In religious devotion, he is reverentially called the \"Emperor Guan\" (Guān Dì) or \"Lord Guan\" (Guān Gōng). He is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk religion, popular [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]], and small shrines to him are almost ubiquitous in traditional Chinese shops and restaurants. \r\n\r\nh5.

The eastern border stretched as far as the Liao River, the western borders of the empire reached the Pamir Mountains, whilst the northern border reached Lake Baikal.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["冒頓単于"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184519,"created_at":"2024-02-13T23:34:17.124-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-13T23:34:58.266-05:00","title":"transformers_operation_combination","body":"The final installment of the classic portion of the Japanese G1 timeline of the [[Transformers]] franchise.

However, several of the states were founded by the Han people, and all of the states—whether ruled by Xiongnu, Xianbei, Di, Jie, Qiang, Han, or others—took on Han-style dynastic names. The states frequently fought against both one another and the Eastern Jin dynasty, which succeeded the Western Jin in 317 and ruled southern China. The period ended with the unification of northern China in 439 by the Northern Wei, a dynasty established by the Xianbei Tuoba clan. This occurred 19 years after the Eastern Jin collapsed in 420, and was replaced by the Liu Song dynasty. Following the unification of the north by [[Northern Wei]], the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] era of Chinese history began.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["五胡十六国"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":42519,"created_at":"2013-02-18T10:07:57.639-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-13T17:49:16.423-05:00","title":"sukeban","body":"Female [[delinquent]] boss, characterized by their [[long skirt]] uniform (inspired on [[Hakama skirt]]), [[sarashi]], and bleached hair.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スケ番","スケ番長","スケバン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184499,"created_at":"2024-02-13T17:43:36.233-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-13T17:43:36.233-05:00","title":"spring_and_autumn","body":"The Spring and Autumn period or Chunqiu (春秋) in Chinese history lasted from approximately 770 to 481 BC (or later) which corresponds roughly to the first half of the Eastern Zhou period.\r\n\r\nThe period's name derives from the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 481 BCE, which tradition associates with [[Confucius]].

Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right.\"\r\n\r\nThe game was released on January 4, 2012. \r\n\r\nThe story behind the game's development is quite unusual. The original idea for the game stems from a one page sketch by the artist [[Honjou Raita]]. A translated version of the page (post #22437) was posted on 4chan on January 4, 2007. The post received a huge response and eventually a group of people emerged that was highly dedicated to realizing the creation of the game.

It sported a unique double delta planform, the inner delta also forming the air intake trunks for its single turbojet. Aside from its 30mm cannon, it could carry up to 4,082 kg (9,000 lb) of rockets, bombs, and air-to-air missiles. It was replaced by the [[Saab Gripen]] in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nDue to its tailless delta configuration, the Draken was plagued by critical instability and was prone to \"super-stalls\", which claimed the lives of many test pilots. However, when training to recover from a super-stall, its pilots realized the plane was capable of rapidly lifting its nose to an almost vertical level, then recover after applying power and negative controls with minimal loss in altitude. This maneuver would later become known in Swedish as the \"kort parad\" (short parade in English), but to the rest of the world, it would receive the nickname of \"[[cobra maneuver|Swedish Cobra]]\".\r\n\r\nh4.

Test Able consisted of a [[nuclear weapon|Mark III]] [[bomb]] dropped from a [[B-29 Superfortress]], while Test Baker consisted of a Mark III bomb detonated underwater. Some of the ships were sunk outright, many were damaged, and almost all were severely radioactively contaminated and had to be scuttled.\r\n\r\nOperation Crossroads is sometimes referenced, both in-game and in fan works, by the [[Kantai Collection]] characters who were historically present: [[Nagato (kancolle)|]], [[Nevada (kancolle)|]], [[Prinz Eugen (kancolle)|]], [[Sakawa (kancolle)|]], and [[Saratoga (kancolle)|]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The Japanese Army designation was \"[b]Army Type 3 Fighter[/b]\" (三式戦闘機). Its Allied reporting name was [b]Tony[/b] and the only mass-produced Japanese fighter of the war to use a liquid-cooled inline V engine. The inline engines used were derivatives of the Daimler-Benz DB series (the Ki-61-I variants used the Ha-40, the Japanese version of the DB 601 engine while the Ki-61-II variants used the Ha-140, the Japanese equivalent of the DB 605 engine) and were generally unreliable due to the Japanese Army having lack of experience with inline engines.\r\n\r\nInitially armed with two 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns in the fuselage and two 7.7 x 58 mm SR Type 89 machine guns in the wings, it was upgraded to four 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns (the wing machine guns being replaced), two 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns in the fuselage and two MG 151/20 cannons (20 x 82 mm) in the wings and finally to two 20 x 94 mm Ho-5 cannons in the fuselage and two 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns in the wings (the wing machine guns were sometimes removed).\r\n\r\nIt was designed by Doi Takeo [土井 武夫] and entered combat for first time in early 1943.\r\n\r\nh4.
