She loves fear and has her own television show, \"Miss Scary's Late Night Scare Fest.\" Her house is a haunted house in the middle of the woods. She has a collection of a variety of masks and they were changed in Season 2 (one of them being a Mr. Grumpy mask which spooked some aliens in Picnic), which she uses to scare the other Mr. Men and Little Misses, though she can get scared by them as well. She has a scary snore, as seen in Sleep. She loves it when Little Miss Magic teleports. Miss Scary will snort when she laughs. In the US and UK Versions, she is voiced by Susan Balboni and Jo Wyatt (which looks like it sounds like shes is a Mr. Man). She is first seen in Physical.\r\n\r\nAccents: American Witch-like in the US and British Tomboyish in the UK.

He lives on top of a hill and must go to Wobbletown at the bottom of the hill to do errands. He shouts to Mrs. Crumb, the baker, \"I'D LIKE A LOAF OF BREAD!\" and he shouts to Mr. Bacon, the butcher, \"I'D LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT!\" Having just about had it with Mr. Noisy's noisiness, Mrs. Crumb and Mr. Bacon come up with a plan. Next day, when Mr. Noisy goes shopping at both their shops again, Mrs. Crumb and Mr. Bacon just pretend not to hear him. Next day, when Mr. Noisy tries again at both shops, he realizes that he has to be quiet if he's to get what he wants. He also learns not to clump his shoes, not to open and shut doors loudly, and he also learns to whisper.\r\n\r\nIn the 2008 TV series The Mr. Men Show, Mr. Noisy remains relatively the same in looks, though he is given a megaphone-styled bullhorn to emphasize his character trait. He lives next door to Mr. Quiet in a stereo-shaped house. Every time he walks his boots make loud stomping sounds like an elephant. The ironic thing would be that even though he tells people to keep quiet, he is the one making the noise (as proven in Books and Music).In the episode Travel Miss Magic accidently turned him into a giant, red, loud whale.In the US and UK Versions he is voiced by Richard Epcar and Rob Rackstraw.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["氏騒々しいです"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":67696,"created_at":"2015-08-14T22:49:32.016-04:00","updated_at":"2015-08-14T23:10:58.653-04:00","title":"nashu_mhakaracca","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ナシュ","ナシュ・マカラッカ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":10572,"created_at":"2009-03-07T12:37:39.400-05:00","updated_at":"2015-08-14T20:59:24.052-04:00","title":"final_fantasy_xii_revenant_wings","body":"Strategy JRPG [[Nintendo DS]] sequel of [i][[Final Fantasy XII]][/i] (PS2), both by [[Square Enix]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ファイナルファンタジーXIIレヴァナント・ウイング"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":67690,"created_at":"2015-08-14T20:50:36.209-04:00","updated_at":"2015-08-14T20:50:36.209-04:00","title":"yuzu_pon","body":"Ambiguous tag.\r\n\r\nFor the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Suzumura_(bellvillageszmr)]].\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":67686,"created_at":"2015-08-14T15:38:36.966-04:00","updated_at":"2015-08-14T15:38:36.966-04:00","title":"kusuri_no_marjoram","body":"[b]Kusuri no Marjoram[/b] (くすりのマジョラム) is a [[4koma]] Manga by [[Suzushiro Seri]].\r\n\r\nh4.
