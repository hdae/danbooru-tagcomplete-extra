Beth likes to add some dramatic elements to her plays, especially when she is planning her grand entrance. It probably would have been better to pose as a nobody to infiltrate the Rah Empire's Kanterbury refugee camp. Choosing to pose as Penny, who was beloved by everyone, and go around the camp while betraying everyone's love has to be her adding that dramatic aspect to her plan. She can sacrifice without hesitation any piece on her chess board to achieve her goals, because all those moves are steps to serve a greater good for the invader's mission and to fulfill the Savior's prophecy that was never wrong.\r\n\r\nTo the invaders the Savior's prophecy is a \"maxim\" that cannot be doubted. Beth, like all other invaders, learned and preached the words of the Savior and trained to \"reclaim\" the world. Beth's cunning game of chess based on the maxim should always prevail. Pitiful savages would never understand it, and she pities the pitiful savages for not understanding it. Then who is this Guardian that casts doubt on Beth's faith? Everything else is as the prophecy, but this Guardian causes chaos and discord and it annoys Beth. Is the Savior wrong, or is the Guardian's heresy corrupting savior's pureness? Beth has no choice but to be in doubt.\r\n\r\nShe loathes when someone calls her real name and everyone is required to call her 'High Priest.'

However, the greedy humans, who got help from Garam, pulled a scheme to steal Sage's magic which ultimately led to Dallae's death. Garam got engulfed in sorrow and rage and went on a frenzy. Nari, awakened from her sleep, alleviated Garam's frenzy and reminded him about the duty as a sage, and Garam finally calmed himself down and went on a path of training to once again uphold his duty as a sage. This time, he hopes to learn to control himself and his power through archery, and he aims to nurture a wider world with his warm heart without settling at one place.\r\n\r\nAfter training for ages in the mountains, Garam had no idea what was going on with the world.

February 13 jul. / 26. February  1910 greg. In Kamenetz-Podolsky , Russian Empire , now Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine ; † 13. May 1988 in Moscow. \r\nSergei Georgievich Gorshkov was born in 1910 as the son of a teacher. In 1927 he entered the Soviet Navy and initially studied physics and mathematics in Leningrad , where he also graduated from the Frunze Naval College , before serving as an officer from 1931, first in the Black Sea Fleet and then in the Pacific Fleet .\r\n\r\nWhen the Great Patriotic War broke out in 1941, he commanded the Azov flotilla as rear admiral . In the course of this activity he also got to know Leonid Brezhnev , who later became head of state and party of the Soviet Union , who reported in his memoirs that his unit had been rescued from the German encirclement by Gorshkov's ships. Gorshkov later commanded the Danube flotilla until he lost his command due to differences of opinion with the Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Ukrainian Front , Marshal Fyodor Tolbuchin .\r\n\r\nUnder Nikita Khrushchev , Gorshkov rose to First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy in 1955, then in January 1956 he was appointed successor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Nikolai Gerassimowitsch Kuznetsov , and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Gorshkov, who had joined the Communist Party in 1942 , was elected a candidate for the Central Committee of the CPSU , and in 1961 was finally elected a full member of the Central Committee. In 1967 he was promoted to Fleet Admiral of the Soviet Union, the maritime equivalent of Marshal of the Soviet Union .\r\n\r\nAs Commander in Chief, he was able to convince Khrushchev of the need to convert the Soviet Navy from a coastal defense to a “global” fleet that would be able to assert Soviet interests worldwide. By 1985, among other things, the defense budget of the Soviet Union had inflated to 40% of the total budget, which led Mikhail Gorbachev to fire Gorshkov and replace him with Admiral Vladimir Chernavin , who had served as chief of staff since 1982.\r\n\r\nGorshkov died on May 13, 1988 in Moscow.\r\n\r\nBecause of his commitment, Gorshkov was seen as the \"father of the Soviet nuclear submarines\" or the \"father of the Soviet deep-sea fleet\", whose meaning equals a \" Mahan of the Soviet Union\".","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123315,"created_at":"2021-04-14T09:04:47.329-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T09:04:47.329-04:00","title":"sakonji_biwako","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["左近司琵琶子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123314,"created_at":"2021-04-14T06:50:37.028-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T06:50:37.028-04:00","title":"hitachi_chigusa","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヒタチ・千草"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123309,"created_at":"2021-04-14T05:47:21.389-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T05:48:27.767-04:00","title":"food_with_face","body":"[[Food]] purposefully drawn to have a face: with eyes at minimum, and often a mouth.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":33694,"created_at":"2012-03-31T19:09:48.895-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T00:29:53.999-04:00","title":"super_love_lotion","body":"The end theme of Toei's [[Tokimeki Tonight]], the closing sequence of which features main character [[Etou Ranze]] posing and sashaying while wearing only a [[cape]].
