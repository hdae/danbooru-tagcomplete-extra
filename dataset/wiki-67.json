He laid the foundation for what was to become the state of [[Cao Wei]] (220–265), established by his son and successor [[Cao Pi]], who ended the Eastern Han dynasty and inaugurated the [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms|Three Kingdoms period]] (220–280). \r\n\r\nCao Cao rose to prominence in the 190s during which he recruited his own followers, formed his own army, and set up a base in Yan Province (covering parts of present-day Henan and Shandong). In 196, he received [[Emperor Xian]], the figurehead Han sovereign who was previously held hostage by other warlords such as [[Dong Zhuo]], [[Li Jue]], and [[Guo Si]]. After he established the new imperial capital in Xuchang, Emperor Xian and the central government came under his direct control, but he still paid nominal allegiance to the emperor. Throughout the 190s, Cao Cao actively waged wars in central China against rival warlords such as [[Lu bu|Lü Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]], and [[Zhang Xiu]], eliminating all of them. Following his triumph over the warlord [[Yuan Shao]] at the Battle of Guandu in 200, Cao Cao launched a series of campaigns against Yuan Shao's sons and allies over the following seven years, defeated them, and unified much of northern China under his control. In 208, shortly after Emperor Xian appointed him as Imperial Chancellor, he embarked on an expedition to gain a foothold in southern China, but was defeated by the allied forces of the warlords [[Sun Quan]], [[Liu Bei]], and [[Liu Qi]] at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent attempts over the following years to annex the lands south of the Yangtze River never proved successful. Cao Cao died in Luoyang in March 220 and was succeeded by his son Cao Pi, who accepted the abdication of Emperor Xian in November 220 and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Eastern Han dynasty. This marked the transition from the Eastern Han dynasty to the Six Dynasties period. After taking the throne, Cao Pi granted his father the posthumous title \"Emperor Wu\" (\"Martial Emperor\") and the temple name \"Taizu\" (\"Grand Ancestor\"). \r\n\r\nh5.

This tag applies to a shipgirl whose second remodel has yet to be implemented at the time of drawing, especially if that shipgirl would eventually get an official second remodel that is significantly different than what the fan artist imagined.\r\n\r\nSo-called \"third remodels\" also count as original remodels; [[bismarck (kancolle)|Bismarck]] has an official \"Drei\" form, [[kongou (kancolle)|Kongou]] has an official third \"what if\" remodel, [[Shigure (kancolle)|]] has also been given [[shigure_kai_san_(kancolle)|a third retrofit]], and no other shipgirl has a form beyond a second remodel, barring seasonal CGs, although [[Yukikaze (kancolle)|]]'s nominal second remodel can be considered an actual third remodel due to the existence of her [[tan yang (kancolle)|Tan Yang]] form. Hypothetical costumes and gear that come with a yet-to-be-implemented eventual name change or form (such as Tan Yang's, pre-official implementation) can also be considered original remodels.\r\n\r\nThe tag is especially useful if a shipgirl, such as a destroyer, is given an outfit similar to those worn by her officially remodeled sisters. This is typical for shipgirls of the same class and/or fleshed out by the same illustrator.\r\n\r\nEven if an original remodel correctly predicts an official remodel, this tag should be used depending on when the original remodel was published in relation to the release of the official one. [[shikinami (kancolle)|Shikinami's]] is a good example; her second remodel was made known through the official Kancolle calendar for 2020 (announced November 2019), but some fan artists have drawn it in some form long before that, probably using [[ayanami (kancolle)|Ayanami's]] as the basis (such as post #3841559, posted on Twitter April 2, 2019). [[yura (kancolle)|Yura's]] is another example; post #2534054 guessed in late 2016 her second remodeled form which was mostly confirmed as first teased on Comptiq's June 2017 issue (post #2719435).\r\n\r\nh4.

The character, created in 1958 by artist Maria Perego, her husband Federico Caldura, and fellow artist Guido Stagnaro, debuted on Italian television in 1959 and has been customarily voiced by actor Giuseppe \"Peppino\" Mazzullo and later Davide Garbolino. The Italian nickname \"Gigi\" is a derivative of Luigi (\"Louis\"), so Topo Gigio could be translated as [b]Louie Mouse[/b].\r\n\r\nTopo Gigio was very popular in [[Italy]] for many years—not only on TV, but also in children's magazines, such as the classical Corriere dei Piccoli, animated cartoons, merchandising and movies. In 1963, the character's popularity spread to the world after being featured on The Ed Sullivan Show in the U.S.\r\n\r\nToday, Topo Gigio still has fans and has become an icon of Italian pop culture. He performs regularly at Zecchino d'Oro festival and other programs created by Antoniano and RAI. The character also spawned two feature-length motion pictures, The Magic World of Topo Gigio (1965) and Topo Gigio and the Missile War (1967), an anime series, and a 2020 animated series of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe puppet has made appearances and has a fan base in many other countries—including [[Argentina]], Bolivia, [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, [[Peru]], [[Portugal]], Puerto Rico, Romania, [[Spain]], Uruguay, [[Venezuela]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["トッポ・ジージョ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":180302,"created_at":"2023-12-24T03:09:20.370-05:00","updated_at":"2024-04-15T06:06:23.652-04:00","title":"tiku-taku","body":"[i]☆※∞□♪♪[/i]\r\n\r\nA small [[mouse (animal)|]] who lives inside a [[grandfather clock]].
