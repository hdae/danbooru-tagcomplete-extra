Episode 0\r\n\r\nEpisode 0, which is counter-intuitively the second novel released, is a short \"fandisk\" that takes place before the events of episode 1, and gives the player character's sister a much larger role. It's also somewhat of a showcase of new features not present in the first game, which include the ability to directly interact with the cast by clicking on them.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 1\r\n\r\nEpisode 1, the first novel released, centers on the characters [[Chocola (nekopara)|]] and [[Vanilla (nekopara)|]], whom the main character lives with, sleeps with and eventually has sex with. While Chocola and Vanilla are the main characters, the novel also includes a supporting cast of four other cat girls and the player character's sister.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 2\r\n\r\nEpisode 2, the third novel released, adds [[Coconut (nekopara)|]] and [[Azuki (nekopara)|]] to the center character group. The two were formerly members of the supporting cast. \r\n\r\nh6. Episode 3\r\n\r\nEpisode 3, the fourth novel released, focuses on [[Cinnamon (nekopara)|]] and [[Maple (nekopara)|]]. As with [[Coconut (nekopara)|]] and [[Azuki (nekopara)|]] before them, they started as supporting characters.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 4\r\n\r\nThe fifth novel released, Episode 4 focuses on the player character [[Minazuki Kashou]] and his family, exploring his past. It also introduces a new supporting character, [[Fraise (nekopara)|]].\r\n\r\nAn otome game spinoff titled [[Nekopara - Catboys Paradise]] was released in 2021. The spinoff was originally presented simply as an April Fool's joke in 2019, but due to unexpected high demand, it would later be made into a full game.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her job is to welcome people into Hell, from which they can never escape her grasp. It is stated that she does her job by offering people a cut of her payment, the amount of which is based on how many people she dragged to hell, and she gave the people she brought to hell the money she promised them. This method resulted in the people she dragged to hell to not hate her and making the Yama question if she did her job too well.\r\n\r\nIn the events of UDoALG, she mainly acts as Zanmu's confidant, though she occasionally disobeys her orders in an attempt to make Zanmu mad.\r\n\r\nDue to her omake profile describing her relationship with Zanmu, alongside some choice dialogue (including panting in front of her and asking Suika how to make Zanmu look at her) coupled with her one-track obsession with making Zanmu scold her, fans have taken to depicting her as a lesbian masochist.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her friendship/rivalry with [[Mononobe no Futo]] led her to be unable to reincarnate like Futo and [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]]. Soga instead came back as a [[ghost]], with two [[ghost tail]]s in the place of legs. Exactly where her body transitions from human-like to ghost-like is unclear, due to the long dress that she wears.\r\n\r\nHer name came from \"Tojiko no Iratsume\":[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/刀自古郎女], a daughter of [[Soga no Umako]] and consort of [[Shoutoku Taishi]]. Since her name comes from the consort of the character on whom [[Toyosatomimi no Miko]] was based, the two are often depicted by fans as a [[couple]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Owing to her expertise, she became [[Gensokyo]]'s chief pharmacist.\r\n\r\nDue to her estimated age (well over 1000 years old and possibly one of the original Lunarians) and her relatively mature demeanor (compared to her charge), she is often included in the \"Old Maids Alliance\" with [[Yakumo Yukari]] and [[Yasaka Kanako]].\r\n\r\nMost famous for the fans' rallying cry \"Eirin!

She is also powerful enough to have her own shikigami, a [[nekomata]] named [[Chen]], to whom she is portrayed to act motherly towards prominently in fanworks.\r\n\r\nIn volume two of [[Strange Creators of Outer World]], it has been revealed that Ran is actually a shikigami parasitically taking host of a nine-tailed fox youkai so strongly that the host's personality never shows on the surface; leading people to not have any difficulty seeing her as a kitsune. However, this seemed to be subtlely hinted at in Yukari's [[Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red]] article where Yukari constantly repeats to [[shameimaru aya|Aya]] that Ran is a shikigami and not an animal.\r\n\r\nIn [[Unfinished Dream of All Living Ghost]], Ran (or maybe just her host body) is revealed to have once been an inhabitant of the Animal Realm, and to have been friends with [[Toutetsu Yuuma]].\r\n\r\nRan has been described to have a gentle personality and to share her host's species-wide love of [[aburaage|fried tofu]]. She excels at mathematics and is able to solve nigh impossible equations instantly; simply seeing it as a hobby to kill time. She is rather robotic in nature when it comes to following Yukari's orders whereas Ran herself describes them as \"Yukari's programming\". Due to her master's prominent sleeping habits, Ran is usually doing her bidding at a constant. However, Yukari herself has stated that she would like to see Ran do something other than simply follow her orders.\r\n\r\nRan is simply seen as a tool that's loved in Yukari's eyes. If she is to ever stray away from her duties as a shikigami or to forget that she is one, she is to be violently disciplined, such as being beaten on the head by her parasol.\r\n\r\nShe is notorious in many fanworks as a streaker, earning her the nickname \"Suppa Tenko\":/pools/1733 (\"Naked Heavenly Fox\"), and for bursting into an [[excessive nosebleed]] if Chen does anything exceptionally cute.\r\n\r\nh4.
