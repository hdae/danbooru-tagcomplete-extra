She has [[large breasts]] and [[brown hair]] usually in [[short twintails|short]], [[low twintails]]. \r\n\r\nSanae is a former police officer who quit the force to become an idol, largely because the Producer convinced her. She is very flirtatious to the Producer and uses a lot of police terminology when talking. She wishes to be seen by other idols as an older sister and be called Onee-sama, despite the fact that she is shorter than idols who are half her age. Sanae has a black belt in Aikido, Judo, and Karate. She also tends to get upset if others mention that she is single, and is very easily susceptible to drinking to drown her sorrows.\r\n\r\nShe is in the upper tier for bust size, which is further enhanced because she's rather short. Her cards often reference that she wants to put the Producer in handcuffs, lock him up, and do an interrogation as a teasing double entendre.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Sanae is a former police officer. She sees herself as an older sister to her fellow idols and will go to great lengths to help promote this. She leads training lessons for [[Aino Nagisa]], [[Akanishi Erika]], [[Yagami Makino]], and [[Ohnishi Yuriko]]. While she finds it extremely difficult, Sanae continues to do so because she wants to be considered reliable. She puts other’s wants before hers, and can sometimes wind up looking like a fool because of it. She is nervous when it comes to [[Aihara Yukino]]’s high class tea and ceramics.\r\n\r\nSanae has a habit of getting drunk, and often drags other idols into it as well. She has found drinking buddies in [[Takagaki Kaede]], [[Hiiragi Shino]], [[Shinohara Rei]], and [[Hyodo Rena]] and made friends with [[Yanagi Kiyora]]. Sanae earned a movie role of an evil mahjong player, and in turn became one of [[Munakata Atsumi]]’s ogling victims. Her sense of style seems to mostly include extremely short dresses that show a lot of cleavage. She is said to be stunning in a bathing suit, although she has put on a child’s swimsuit in order to gain attention.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 8th CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Tachibana Arisu]], [[Ichinose Shiki]], [[Shiomi Syuko]], and [[Sakurai Momoka]]. She is voiced by [[Waki Azumi]] [和氣 あず未].\r\n\r\nh4.

However, there are other variations, including one well-known recipe which uses Worcestershire sauce and shredded cabbage. To differentiate the two, the former is sometimes called \"[i]Tamago-toji [bound-together-with-egg] katsudon[/i],\" whereas the latter is called \"[i]Sauce Katsudon[/i].\"\r\n\r\nA common trope in Japanese crime dramas is for the detective to eat katsudon while interrogating a suspect. The typical heart-of-gold type detective would think, \"if this guy goes to the slammer, he'd never be able to eat anything as good as this again,\" and then use his own coin to order a katsudon delivered straight to the suspect's house. Then the suspect would be moved so much as to turn himself in and confess to the crime, tears streaming down his face. And so goes the cliche. For these stories, there is an explanation that katsudon was the most expensive food that one could get on a police officer's salary. \r\n\r\nThis is nowadays only seen as a joke or stereotype, but Japanese people have come up with the expression, \"let someone eat katsudon,\" which carries the same meaning as \"read someone their Miranda rights\" (see post #1184509).\r\n\r\nh4.
