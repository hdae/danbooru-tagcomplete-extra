On March 9th, Germany established its defence plan for the city with Operation Clausewitz. The first defensive preparations at the outskirts of Berlin were made on March 20th, under the newly appointed commander of Army Group Vistula, \"General Gotthard Heinrici\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Heinrici .\r\n\r\nWhen the Soviet offensive resumed on April 16th, two Soviet fronts (army groups) attacked Berlin from the east and south, while a third overran German forces positioned north of Berlin. Before the main battle in Berlin commenced, the Red Army encircled the city after successful (but very costly) battles of the Seelow Heights and Halbe. \r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 1945, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday, the 1st Belorussian Front led by \"Marshal Georgy Zhukov\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Zhukov , advancing from the east and north, started shelling Berlin's city centre, while Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front broke through Army Group Centre and advanced towards the southern suburbs of Berlin. On April 23th General Helmuth Weidling assumed command of the forces within Berlin. The garrison consisted of several depleted and disorganised Army and Waffen-SS divisions, along with poorly trained Volkssturm and Hitler Youth members. Over the course of the next week, the Red Army gradually took the entire city.\r\n\r\nOn April 30th, Hitler and several of his officials committed suicide. The city of [[Berlin]]'s garrison surrendered on May 2nd but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city until the end of the war in Europe on May 8th (May 9th in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies rather than to the Soviets.\r\n\r\nh4.

She was commissioned on November 19th, and dispatched nine days later to Kure Naval Base to complete her fitting out.

Its long designation was \"Type 0 Carrier Fighter\" (零式艦上戦闘機), and it was commonly called \"Reisen\" (零戦, zero fighter) by its pilots. This nickname was also popular among the Allies, more so than the official reporting name \"Zeke\". The plane was designed by [[Horikoshi Jirou]]. \r\n\r\nWhen the [b]ZERO[/b] was first introduced in 1940 it was considered the most capable carrier-based fighter, combining excellent maneuverability with a good climb rate and a very long operational range. These qualities combined with the excellent training of IJN pilots allowed the Japanese to win numerous early victories over their Allied adversaries. Because of its attributes the Zero was instrumental in the success of the attack at [[Pearl Harbor]].\r\n\r\nHowever, after the Americans introduced the [[F6F Hellcat]] and [[F4U Corsair]] in 1942, both of which are much faster, have longer operational range, and are more resilient and have better armor than the Zero, it began to struggle to compete against both planes, particularly due to its weak airframe and being particularily vulnerable to boom-and-zoom tactics. In the later half of the war, with [[battle_of_midway|the loss of experienced IJN pilots]], the Zero were mostly assigned as suicidal [i][[kamikaze pilot|kamikaze]][/i] aircraft in a desperate attempt to defend the country of [[Japan]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Initially, it dealt with personal computer products, but later expanded to the development and publishing of video games, mobile content, video game peripherals and music recording. \r\n\r\nPrimarily a video game publisher, it internally developed many of the video games it released while outsourcing others to external companies. It is known for series such as [[Bomberman]], [[Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima|Adventure Island]], [[Star Soldier]], and [[PC-Genjin|Bonk]]. Hudson also developed video games released by other publishers such as the Mario Party series from Nintendo.\r\n\r\nHudson Soft made the [[PC Engine]]/TurboGrafx-16 in association with [[NEC Corporation]], to compete against [[Nintendo]], [[SEGA]], and [[SNK]], while continuing making games on other platforms as a third-party developer.\r\n\r\nThe mascot of the company is a [[bee]] named [[Hachisuke]]. Hudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012, and merged with [[Konami]] Digital Entertainment, which was the surviving entity.

It provides IT and network solutions, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of things (IoT) platform, and telecommunications equipment and software, to business enterprises, communications services providers and to government agencies, and has also been the biggest Personal [[Computer]] vendor in Japan since the 1980s, when it launched the PC-8000 series.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, NEC licensed technology from [[Hudson]] Soft, a video game manufacturer, to create a video [[game console]] called the [[PC Engine]] (later released in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 in the North American market). While the PC Engine achieved a considerable following, it has been said that NEC held a much stronger influence on the video game industry through its role as a leading semiconductor manufacturer than through any of its direct [[video game]] products.\r\n\r\nNEC was the world's fourth-largest PC manufacturer by 1990. Its semiconductors business unit was the world's largest semiconductor company by annual revenue from 1985 to 1992, the second largest in 1995, one of the top three in 2000, and one of the top 10 in 2006. NEC spun off its semiconductor business to Renesas Electronics and Elpida Memory. Once Japan's major electronics company, NEC has largely withdrawn from manufacturing since the beginning of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nNEC was #463 on the 2017 Fortune 500 list.

The series was created by [[Nagai Gou]] (Kiyoshi Nagai).\r\n\r\nThe story tells the adventures of [[Kabuto Kouji]], the young brave pilot of Mazinger Z, a powerful [[mecha]] with super powers that fights against evil hostile giant [[robot]]s called \"mechanical [[monster|beasts]]\".\r\n\r\nDue to its popularity the original manga was turned into a 92 episode anime that debuted also in late 1972 and ended in 1974. It has spawned several notable sequels and spinoff series, among them [[UFO Robo Grendizer]], [[Mazinkaiser]], and [[Robot Girls Z]].\r\n\r\nMazinger Z was broadcast in several countries and became very famous worldwide. Its fame in some European countries was such that even \"a giant statue of the titular robot\":http://trip-n-travel.com/listicle/16496/ was erected in the province of Tarragona, [[Spain]], in the year 1979. \r\n\r\nIt was also a very popular anime in [[Mexico]] during the 1980s, where it was dubbed into [[spanish_text|Spanish]] directly from the Japanese version, keeping all the original Japanese character names intact and broadcasting all the complete 92 episodes, unlike the version later aired in the [[united_states|U.S.]] (which was called [i][b]Tranzor Z[/b][/i] and was not very popular due to its severe censorship and many absent episodes).\r\n\r\nMexican director [[Guillermo del Toro]] has cited this show as a very important influence on his movie [[Pacific Rim]].
