Parent and Child Posts\r\n\r\nParent and child posts, also known as [b]Post Relationships[/b], are a means of linking together groups of related posts. One post (normally the \"best\" version) is chosen to be the parent, while the other posts are made its children.\r\n\r\nParent/child relationships are typically used to group minor variants of the same image. Pools are another way of grouping posts; see the guidelines below for when to use a pool instead.\r\n\r\nh6. Browsing\r\n\r\nWhen viewing a post in a parent/child relationship, the other posts in the relationship are displayed as thumbnails at the top of the page. In search listings, parent posts are displayed with a green border, while child posts have a yellow border.\r\n\r\nh6. Searching\r\n\r\nParent/child relationships may be searched using the {{parent:ID}}, {{parent:any}}, {{parent:none}}, {{child:any}}, or {{child:none}} metatags (see [[help:cheatsheet]]).\r\n\r\nh6. Adding a parent\r\n\r\nFirst, note the parent post's ID number. This is located under the [b]Information[/b] sidebar when viewing a post, or as part of the URL (e.g. /posts/1234).\r\n\r\nNext, open the child post and click the [b]Edit[/b] link just below the image. Enter the post ID of the parent post in the [b]Parent[/b] field, then click [b]Submit[/b] to save your changes. Repeat this process for all child posts in the relationship.\r\n\r\nYou may also tag the post with the {{parent:ID}} or {{child:ID}} metatag, where ID is the post's ID number. This method can be used with [[help:tag scripts|tag scripts]] to quickly parent multiple posts.\r\n\r\nh6. Removing a parent\r\n\r\nOpen the child post and click the [b]Edit[/b] link just below the image. Clear the [b]Parent[/b] field, then click [b]Submit[/b] to save your changes. Repeat for all other child posts in the relationship as necessary.\r\n\r\nYou may also tag the post with {{parent:none}} or {{-parent:ID}} to remove the parent.\r\n\r\nTo clear the same parent post from multiple children at once, tag the post with {{child:none}}.\r\n\r\nh4. Guidelines\r\n\r\nGenerally, parent/child relationships should be used for minor variations of the same image. For comics or other series of posts meant to be viewed in order, use a [[help:pools|Pool]] instead.\r\n\r\nh6. When TO use Post relationships\r\n\r\n* When the same image is available in multiple resolutions or pixel sizes (see post #716608).\r\n* When cropped and whole versions of the same image has been uploaded (see post #1540326)\r\n* Derivatives of a Post, including setting variations (post #1544682) and costume variations (post #154471). See also post #625848 (hard translation and derivative character art) and post #55525 (smaller post and [[vector trace]]).\r\n* When identical images from different sources have been uploaded. For which posts to set parent and child, see below.\r\n\r\nh6. When NOT to use Post Relationships\r\n\r\nFor most other cases, it would be better to organize these images into a ([[help:pools|Pool]]). Examples include:\r\n\r\n* Pages from a manga or doujin.\r\n* Episodes of a comic.\r\n* Any other series of posts intended to be viewed in order.\r\n* Large collections of posts.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, Pools provide additional navigation features not available with Post Relationships.\r\n\r\nh4. Choosing the Best Parent\r\n\r\nThe Parent Post should be considered in this order:\r\n\r\nh6. For identical images\r\n\r\n* [b]Most recent [u]active[/u] revision[/b]. There are exceptional cases where the latest revision is worse (ie, much smaller resolution, unless both are already [[absurdres]]) than the previous image (post #2645830). See [[MD5 mismatch]], [[revision]], and [[has bad revision]].\r\n* [b]Highest resolution[/b]. If a picture has been [[upscaled]], the upscaled version should be the child.\r\n* [b]Uncensored[/b]. Official [[uncensored]] versions (not to be confused with nude or third-party [[decensored]] versions) should be the parent, while censored ones should be children.\r\n* [b]Highest quality[/b] (see [[jpeg_artifacts]], [[scan_artifacts]]). Prefer images with fewer artifacts. Larger filesize tends to mean higher quality, but not always.\r\n* [b]Most lossless file format[/b] (png > jpg).

Generally referred to by its plan number of A-150 in English, in Japanese they are popularly referred to as the [b]Super Yamato-class[/b] battleships. The war would end before a ship could begin formal construction, and to maintain its secrecy, many details on its design were destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the loss of significant formal information on the Super Yamato, much speculation exists on the exact specifications of the battleship, though what information exists has led speculation on it contending for the title of the \"most powerful battleships in history\" if built, such as its main battery of six 45-caliber 51cm guns in three twin turrets, dwarfing the [[Yamato (battleship)|]]-class' 46cm guns. In turn, due to the Yamato-class consisting of the largest battleships ever commissioned, it is generally believed that the Super Yamato-class battleships would have been even larger.\r\n\r\nDespite only existing in concept, the Super Yamato has made appearances in media. [[World of Warships]] features the design in three ships currently in the game: the Izumo (an early A-150s design), Shikishima (initially called the Yashima, and is unrelated to the Shikishima-class battleship), and Satsuma (a further development of the A-150 design). It makes an appearance in [[Ryuu ga Gotoku 6|Yakuza 6]] as [spoiler]the \"Secret of Onomichi\", the project not being scrapped and it continuing production using embezzled money, with the English translation naming it the \"Yamato Mark II\"[/spoiler]. She appears in [[Warship Girls R]] with the name [[A150 (warship girls r)|]], with her enemy counterpart baring the name [[enemy a150 (warship girls r)|Cyou-yamato]]. Some appearances utilize the names theorized by journalist Itou Masanori, being \"Kii\" (紀伊) or \"Owari\" (尾張), potentially inheriting the name(s) of the similarly-planned Kii-class battleships (though this is speculation entirely based on battleship naming conventions) - an example can be found with Fujimi's model ships, releasing the 'phantom battleship' Kii.\r\n\r\nh4.
