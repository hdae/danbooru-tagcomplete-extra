Appearance\r\n[tn]See post #3480676.[/tn]\r\n\r\nAs a shipgirl, Azuma is portrayed with [[long hair|long]] [[black hair]] and [[yellow_eyes|golden-colored eyes]], along with animal ears similar to [[takao_(azur_lane)|Takao]] and [[large_breasts|a sizeable bust]]. Her outfit consists of a [[white jacket]] hanging off her shoulders, likely based off Imperial Japanese Navy [[military uniform]]s, a button-up shirt with her [[lace-trimmed bra]] [[see-through clothes|visible past the shirt]], a black [[pleated skirt]], [[black gloves]], and dark-colored [[pantyhose]]. Her personality is similar to [[atago_(azur_lane)|Atago]], being very \"onee-san\" and gently teasing the Commander. \r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] is themed to act as a chair for her to sit on, with her three 310 mm triple gun mounts to her sides (two on left, one on right) on bow pieces, as well as two 100 mm twin [[anti-aircraft gun|DP mounts]] to her sides at shoulder level. She also has a reconnaissance seaplane to her lower left, while she uses a [[katana]] as a melee weapon.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\nAzuma is a never-built ship based on one of Japan's Project B-65 proposals. The B-65 project was intended to create a \"super-cruiser\" meant to replace the aging [[Kongou (Azur Lane)|]]-class battlecruisers and lead the IJN's cruiser squadrons into a planned \"Decisive Battle\" against the US Navy. Her purpose during such an engagement was to lay down heavy barrages against American heavy cruisers while being resistant to any return fire from them. While extensive design work had been carried out, no ships were laid down as Japan's focus shifted to replacing their extensive carrier losses after the [[battle of Midway]] and materials grew scarce. \r\n\r\nAs a reference to World of Warships, as per the collab, Azuma gains an ability based off of the \"Demolition Expert\" skill, increasing her high explosive damage and chance to set fires. \r\n\r\nh4.

This illusion is an example of a peripheral drift illusion, where the brain interprets static visual information as dynamic motion. The Primrose Field Illusion is particularly striking due to its use of color, which enhances the perceived motion.\r\n\r\nThe illusion works by exploiting the way the brain processes visual information. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns and motion, and the Primrose Field Illusion takes advantage of this by presenting a subtle, gradient-like pattern that our brains interpret as movement. The use of color and the specific arrangement of the squares create a sense of depth and dimensionality, further reinforcing the illusion.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209091,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:16:54.322-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:16:54.322-04:00","title":"shinta_(gundam)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["シンタ(Zガンダム)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209089,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:16:13.377-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:16:13.377-04:00","title":"qum","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クム(Zガンダム)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209087,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:11:17.888-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:11:17.888-04:00","title":"caesar_(monster_strike)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["カエサル(モンスト)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209084,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:08:46.799-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:08:46.799-04:00","title":"alva_(eastward)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アルヴァ(イーストワード)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209083,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:08:01.628-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:08:01.628-04:00","title":"john_(eastward)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ジョン(イーストワード)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209082,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:07:19.560-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:07:41.939-04:00","title":"sam_(eastward)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["珊(イーストワード)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209080,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:03:34.646-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:03:34.646-04:00","title":"isabel_(eastward)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["イザベル(イーストワード)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209079,"created_at":"2024-09-20T09:57:11.884-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T09:57:30.893-04:00","title":"nui_lunaveil","body":"Vtuber\r\n\r\nhttps://x.com/nui_lunaveil\r\nhttps://x.com/nuii_sub\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Nui_LunaVeil","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ニュイ・ルナベル","にゅいちゃん","にゅいのえ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162809,"created_at":"2023-04-22T08:02:08.925-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T09:51:41.930-04:00","title":"you're_finished_(yu-gi-oh!)","body":"A [[sukeban]]-themed [[oni]] girl [[Duel Monster]] trap card with [[multicolored_hair|red-and-black hair]], [[red eyes]] with [[yellow sclera]], [[freckles]], and a huge [[katana]].

She now wields a full sized yumi.
