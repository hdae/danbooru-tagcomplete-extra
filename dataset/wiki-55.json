The snap blade design uses a single long segmented blade with which you can snap off the leading end when it dulls to once again have a sharp tip.

What defines a character?\r\n\r\nGenerally, it is self-evident who are characters and what aren't. For example, [[Edward Elric]], [[Pikachu]], and [[Simon (ttgl)|]] are obviously characters, while the [[philosopher's stone]], [[Ecruteak City]], and the [[core drill]] are not.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes it isn't as clear cut. While there is no official policy on what a character is, the unofficial rule of thumb seems to be: [b]If it talks, acts on its own, or is otherwise shown to be sentient in the source material (game, anime, manga, novel), it is a character.[/b]\r\n\r\nThus, something can be considered a character even if it is an object, for example [[Bardiche (nanoha)|]] or Plankton's computer wife [[Karen (spongebob)|]].\r\n\r\nh5. What types of things SHOULD NOT be a character tag?\r\n\r\nLocations and non-[[mecha]] vehicles are not characters. (See forum #34022)\r\n\r\nSometimes, artists draw an object (computer, software, vehicle, food, etc.) as a humanoid. This is called a [[personification]]. However, the object is still not considered a character, so it should remain a general tag. If the personified version becomes a character in its own right, a separate character tag can be created for it. For example, [[strawberry]] is the food and [[strawberry-chan]] is the personification.\r\n\r\nh5. How to make a character tag.\r\n\r\nTo make a tag be a character tag, prefix it with \"character:\" or \"char:\". Remember to replace spaces with underscores (like_this).\r\n\r\nh6. Name and Name Order\r\n\r\nCharacter tags should be the same name and name order that are used in the original source material. For example, [[Kiyama Hiroto]], not \"Hiroto Kiyama\" or \"Xavier Foster\". If an alternate name, such as a nickname or a name from the English version, is widely used, you may \"request an alias\":[/bulk_update_requests/new] from that to the original language title.\r\n\r\nHowever, some copyrights are [b]exceptions[/b] to this rule. Characters from the following should be tagged with their [b]English-language names[/b] when possible:\r\n* [b][[Ace Attorney]] (Gyakuten Saiban)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Advance Wars]] (Famicom Wars)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Animal Crossing]] (Doubutsu no Mori)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Castlevania (series)|]] (Akumajou Dracula)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Final Fantasy]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Fire Emblem]][/b]\r\n** <tn>To be tagged with the names used in the North American localizations (preferably [i]Fire Emblem Heroes[/i]). See topic #16149.</tn>\r\n* [b][[Golden Sun]] (Ougon no Taiyou)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Granblue Fantasy]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Kid Icarus]] (Hikari Shinwa)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Mario (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Mega Man (series)|]] (Rockman)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Monster Hunter (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Pokemon]][/b] (human and creature)\r\n* [b][[Splatoon (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Tales of (series)|Tales of...]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Xenoblade Chronicles (series)|]][/b]\r\n\r\nh6. Follow [[howto:romanize]].\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure how to romanize the character's name, ask in a comment or on the forum.\r\n\r\nh6. Only one name?\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, characters should be tagged with their full name. However, some characters are only known by a single name (like [[Chen]]). Other times, their full name may be considered a spoiler. Usually these should be tagged with the single name, adding a _(series) qualifier if it is ambiguous. (See [[help:qualifiers]])\r\nIf only their surname is known (e.g. same as their spouse or children), or if the full name is not well-known, it may be appropriate to tag them Mr. or Mrs. Surname. (or Dr. or Professor, etc)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* [[asuna_(sao)]]\r\n* [[yamada_(b-gata_h-kei)]]\r\n* [[bobby_(fma)]]\r\n* [[yuki_(touhou)]]\r\n* [[mrs._bradley]]\r\n* [[mr._koiwai]]\r\n\r\nHowever, if a character is from a game which is self-titled (title comes from character's name, resulting in a [code]character_(series)[/code] copyright tags), it should be left off. Example:\r\n\r\n* [[Mario]] of [[Mario (Series)]]\r\n* [[Kirby]] of [[Kirby (Series)]]\r\n\r\nIn the case of [[original]] characters, the tag should be qualified using the name of the person who designed it. This includes artists as well as non-artists, such as commissioners. The qualifier should be consistent with the name of the artist tag used on the site. Examples:\r\n\r\n* [[Lokulo-chan (Lokulo no Mawashimono)]] by the artist [[Lokulo no Mawashimono]]\r\n* [[Alyssa (SpeckTech)]] by the commissioner SpeckTech\r\n\r\nh6. No name!\r\n\r\nIf the character has no known name but is still recognizable in images (or if their name is a [[spoilers|spoiler]]), a succinct description can be used as a tag for them. If there is consensus among how fans of the series refer to them, use that. If the tag may be ambiguous, add a _(series) or _(artist) qualifier for copyrighted and [[original]] characters respectively.\r\n\r\nCopyrighted examples:\r\n\r\n* [[idoko]]\r\n* [[idoko's_stepsister]]\r\n* [[giha_village_chief]]\r\n* [[nurse_(katawa_shoujo)]]\r\n* [[girl_with_bear_(madoka_magica)]]\r\n* [[lady_in_red_(ib)]]\r\n* [[mysterious_boy_(angel_beats!)]]\r\n* [[man_with_watch]]\r\n* [[kyon's sister]]\r\n* [[girl_from_the_illusionary_world]]\r\n* [[jyushimatsu's_girlfriend]]\r\n\r\n[[Original]] examples:\r\n\r\n* [[Red Girl (Yuuhagi (Amaretto-no-Natsu))]]\r\n* [[Black-haired Demon Girl (Shimmer)]]\r\n* [[Big Sister (navigavi)]]\r\n\r\nh6. Titles and honorifics\r\n\r\nGenerally, characters do not have honorifics or titles in their names, as the honorific changes depending on who is addressing the character. However, some characters have the honorific or title as a permanent part of their name such as [[Chouzetsusaikawa Tenshi-chan]] or [[Mr. C.B. (umamusume)|]] In these cases, keep the honorific or title intact. In cases where a character is frequently addressed by their title, a utility alias can be created to help find the character, such as the alias from Arthur Kirkland -> [[United Kingdom (Hetalia)]].\r\n\r\nh6. Alternate identities, [[genderswap]]s, and other derivatives\r\n\r\nIf a character has alternate identities or forms which are visually distinct, these are tagged as well. Use the official name, or if there is none, the agreed-upon fan referent. [b]Alternate forms may be [[spoilers|spoiler]], so be careful when tagging.[/b] Depending on the situation, the tag for the regular identity may be used with the alternate identity as well. Alternate identity tags may be character-type or general-type; again, it depends on the situation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* [[awakened_miki]]\r\n* [[sakura_miku]]\r\n* [[ex-keine]]\r\n* [[kyonko]]\r\n\r\nNot every genderswap gets their own character tag; only the ones that are popular enough to have established genderswap names.\r\n\r\nException is for younger or older versions of the character, these are covered by the regular character tag, plus whichever applicable age tags: [[aged down]], [[baby]], [[toddler]], [[child]], [[aged up]], [[old_woman]], [[old_man]], etc.\r\n\r\nh6. Cosplays - One character wearing another's costume\r\n\r\nAdd both characters tags (the cosplayer and character they're dressing as) and a third general *_(cosplay) tag for the costume. So [[yakumo ran|Ran]] wearing a Pikachu suit would need:\r\n\r\n* [[cosplay]]\r\n* [[yakumo_ran]]\r\n* [[pikachu_(cosplay)]]\r\n* [[pikachu]] \r\n\r\nThis can be accomplished by just tagging [[yakumo_ran]] and [[pikachu_(cosplay)]], as cosplay tags automatically imply both the character tag and the [[cosplay]] tag.\r\n(see forum #1261)","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":126861,"created_at":"2021-08-11T19:44:00.983-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T18:36:44.460-04:00","title":"bold_and_brash_(spongebob)","body":"A famous painting by one [[Squidward Tentacles]].

The device adds a CD-ROM drive to the Mega Drive console, allowing the user to play CD-based games and providing additional hardware functionality. Other benefits of the add-on include a faster central processing unit and graphic enhancements. It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs. The main benefit of the new add-on's technology was its larger disc space, allowing for larger games to be developed. This would manifest itself in the form of full motion video (FMV) games.\r\n\r\nBy the end of [[1994]], the add-on had sold approximately 2.7 million units worldwide. In [[1995]], it was announced that Sega's support would shift away from the Mega Drive and Sega CD to focus on its new console, the [[Sega Saturn]], and the add-on itself was officially discontinued in [[1996]]. \r\n\r\nRetrospective reception to the add-on is mixed, praising the Sega CD for its individual offerings and additions to the Mega Drive's functions, but criticizing the game library as a whole for its lack of depth and low value for money, as well as issues with how the add-on was supported by Sega.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["メガCD"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232348,"created_at":"2025-03-19T05:26:59.458-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T05:26:59.458-04:00","title":"oosaki_erika","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エリカ・大崎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232347,"created_at":"2025-03-19T05:22:04.808-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T05:22:04.808-04:00","title":"sudou_itsuka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["須藤伊津花"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232345,"created_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:54.695-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:54.695-04:00","title":"lin_jingheng","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["林静恒"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232344,"created_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:43.175-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:43.175-04:00","title":"can_ci_pin","body":"novel","is_locked":false,"other_names":["残次品"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232323,"created_at":"2025-03-19T01:53:37.589-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:42:51.699-04:00","title":"string_bikini_panties","body":"Use either [[string panties]] or [[string bikini]] instead.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":166530,"created_at":"2023-06-09T00:04:30.531-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:31:03.638-04:00","title":"max_(shining_force)","body":"Protagonist of [[Shining Force 1]] and [[Shining Force 2]].

The film received negative reviews from critics and was considered a box-office bomb, grossing $167.9 million worldwide against a production budget of $120 million, with an estimated loss between $80–$100 million for the studio. Fantastic Four received several Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Director and Worst Picture. Trank also voiced his displeasure with the final film, which he attributed to production studio [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]]'s interference.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232231,"created_at":"2025-03-18T16:48:11.532-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-18T16:48:11.532-04:00","title":"blood_censor","body":"A character's body parts have been censored by being drawn with blood covering them.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":218763,"created_at":"2024-12-13T11:57:52.850-05:00","updated_at":"2025-03-18T16:37:14.963-04:00","title":"chuuzenji-sensei_mononoke_kougiroku:_sensei_ga_nazo_o_toite_shimaukara","body":"A school, mystery manga series written and illustrated by [[shimizu aki|Aki Shimizu]].

The Bazooka saw extensive use on all fronts of the war, used against enemy bunkers, pillboxes, fortified positions, and even tanks. \r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in early 1943, many examples of the Bazooka fell into German hands. Impressed with the innovative idea, the Germans copied the Bazooka wholesale, enlarging the rocket and adding a shield to the tube to protect the shooter from backblast, calling the new weapon the [[panzerschreck]], or \"tank terror\".\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

The project had been given the nickname \"[[Blue Archive]] with Swords\" or \"Red Archive\" due to not only sharing a similar theme of school girls with [[halo]]s and weapons, but is made by several former Blue Archive developers.\r\n\r\nIt was initially teased on August 18th, 2024, before a promo video officially revealed it on September 1st, with a visual novel planned for [[Comiket 105]], and a gacha game speculated to release in the future. The project has been \"cancelled\":[https://x.com/DynamisOne/status/1832722210160554111] on September 8th, 2024, speculated to be due to both controversy surrounding accusations of plagiarism, and a suspected threat of a copyright infringement lawsuit from [[Nexon]], Blue Archive's publisher.\r\n\r\nPeculiarly, since the project's announcement, it has spawned a trend of [[futanari]] fanarts. This trend stemmed from the Korean community, where it was joked that the project would be more popular if it involved \"cockfighting\" rather than \"sword fighting\". The original jokes originated from joking KV stood for the Korean slang words \"kochu\" (sword) and \"valgi\" (sword drawing), which is used for [[penis]] and [[erection]], respectively.\r\n\r\nOn February 27th, 2025, it was revealed that the project was originally developed by Nexon, titled \"MX Blade,\" serving as a side story to Blue Archive in production years before Blue Archive was released. With the aftermath of the incident induced by Dynamis One, this original project has since been shelved. Dynamis One would respond on March 18th, however by that point the relevant team members were already in captivity before the announcement post was even shared with the public. \r\n\r\nh4.
