Biography\r\n\r\nMain heroine. Amber and sky-blue long hair, with cherry blossom pink pupils. (Because her hair has something like \"structural coloration\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration, it shines gold when the light hits upon it strongly, and has a tinge of blue where it doesn't.)\r\nShe talks in a manner like \"-hoyo?\", \"hawawa\", \"~nano desu\".\r\n[tn]Because there is no direct English equivalent for these, I left them as is.[/tn]\r\n\r\nShe is a girl who came down from the sky and met Misaki. \r\n\r\nShe has a perfect appearance, like that of a doll:\r\n* according to [[misaki_otome|Masaki Otome]] it's something like this — \"In eighteen years of living, I've never seen a girl like this. Her cuteness is something that cannot be expressed in words\"\r\n* has a face very closely resembling [[rourin|Rourin]]'s, and was both looked over and intimidated by her. She has said that in order to escape from her, it wouldn't be overdoing it to hide in a room where light could never reach. \r\n\r\nReferring to them as \"vessels\", she is in pursuit of every human being. \r\nShe is hiding an unhuman ability. \r\n\"...I don't know, I'm sorry\"\r\n\r\nWith an innocent, absent-minded impression, she isn't sure what she should do or wants to do and so seems like a doll-like girl with nothing in her. \r\nNonetheless, she isn't indifferent; she is openly moved by even small things, and shows a variety of expressions.\r\n\r\nContrary to her apparent age, her mental age is much younger. \r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\nAfter leaving for this outside world and meeting Misaki and the others, experiencing and learning lots of things, eventually she was able to find her own purpose. \r\nIn regards to Misaki, since Misaki was the first person she encountered in this outside world she considers herself indebted to her and thinks of her as her beloved, most important person. \r\n\r\n\r\nFull of emotion and brimming with curiosity, she is more or less a clumsy girl. Basically, she's a friendly person and smiles at everyone. \r\nBeing absent-minded, there are times when one isn't sure what she's thinking about, but generally she herself is naturally an airhead who doesn't really think about anything. \r\nShe also occasionally has the initiative to straight-out tell you what she's thinking. \r\n\r\nDue to her trauma from being locked up for many years and her anxiety that her body being taken over by Rourin, she has a relentless fear of \"I will be lost\". \r\n\r\n[spoiler]She is a clone of \"Air\":https://www.uchinokomato.me/chara/show/12785.\r\nIt's only been a small amount of time since she gained consciousness, and because she escaped without knowing anything, she remains innocent/ignorant.\r\nShe fled from Rourin, who was using the \"key of the world\" entrusted to her by Noel, and came along to Misaki by chance.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nShe likes the blue sky, high-up places where you can see the sky well, and animals.

Known as \"Daigo\" or \"The Beast\" in the west and \"Umehara\" or \"Ume\" in Japan, Umehara is being hailed as the world's most famous [[Street Fighter]] player or the greatest Street Fighter player, he currently holds a world record of \"the most successful player in major tournaments of Street Fighter\" in Guinness World Records.\r\n\r\nh4. [[Evo moment #37|The Dramatic Comeback]]\r\n\r\nUmehara started becoming famous internationally from the YouTube video clips of his match in the Losers bracket final in [[Evolution Championship Series]] 2004's [[street_fighter_iii_(series)|Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike]] competition where he made a dramatic comeback against [[Justin Wong (gamer)|Justin Wong]]'s [[Chun-Li]]. In the final round of match 1, Umehara's [[ken masters|Ken]] was down to his last pixel of vitality. At this point, any special attack would knock Umehara's character out if connected, since special attacks deal chip damage even when blocked. In an attempt to win the round, Wong attempted to hit Umehara's Ken with Chun-Li's multihit Super Art move \"Hou Yoku Sen\" (鳳翼扇). However, instead of avoiding it, Umehara chose to \"Parry,\" a technique whereby an incoming attack is blocked without the player losing any health, but by doing so requires moving toward opponent's direction in the same time a hit lands, within four of thirty frames per second of the impact animation. After the move was launched, not only were all 15 hits Parried, but Umehara also managed to get into a good position to make a powerful attacking combo that knocked Chun-Li out instead. This moment was recorded and later spread on the Internet, gaining immense popularity.\r\n\r\nNHK's TV program, MAG-NET, has called this moment \"Kiseki no Gyakuten Geki\" (奇跡の逆転劇) or \"The miraculous reversal play\".","is_locked":false,"other_names":["梅原大吾","ウメハラ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":8318,"created_at":"2008-09-12T15:43:30.834-04:00","updated_at":"2017-03-27T19:24:43.041-04:00","title":"ikeno_daigo","body":"Artist working for [[capcom|Capcom]].

And their character settings are completely different from the [[Touhou]] canon.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Ryu-san]] (protagonist)\r\n* Iku-san ([[Nagae Iku]])\r\n* [[Buront]]\r\n* [[Hinanawi Tenshi]]\r\n* [[The Iron of Yin and Yang]]\r\n\r\nh4.See  also\r\n\r\n* [[NicoNico]] MyList: http://www.nicovideo.jp/mylist/8739260 \r\n* Nicopedia article: http://dic.nicovideo.jp/id/1111287 ","is_locked":false,"other_names":["グラットン伝説"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30511,"created_at":"2011-11-29T00:08:06.495-05:00","updated_at":"2017-03-25T15:31:03.793-04:00","title":"nyoron_(fudegatana)","body":"Artist, [[NicoNico]] user.

The pressure difference between the higher pressure air below the hull and lower pressure ambient air above it produces lift, which causes the hull to float above the running surface. \r\n\r\nFor stability reasons, the air is typically blown through slots or holes around the outside of a disk- or oval-shaped platform, giving most hovercraft a characteristic rounded-rectangle shape.

As the sole member of the clan, she lives with her butler, Jacques, near the remains of her family's home.\r\n\r\nShe initially invites [[Nikaidou Benimaru]] and [[Duo Lon]] to France to reveal that she knows of the betrayal of Ron and the burning of the Hizoku village. They inform her of Ash's theft of [[Kagura Chizuru|Kagura Chizuru's]] mirror and she decides to join them. With the trio banded with the interest to take down Ash, they form the Rival Team and she eventually scolds Ash for seeming to forsake their mission. Though surprised by the youth's new powers, she swears to stop him in her team's ending.\r\n\r\nBefore meeting with Duo Lon and [[Shen Woo]], she revisits the burned down mansion where she and Ash spent their childhood with a handful of photographs from the area in her hand. During her meeting with her guests, she becomes aware of their intents to join the King of Fighters tournament with her and Ash's location in Paris. Although she just missed him, Elisabeth knows that he was there and fortifies her will to stop him. She reunites with Ash in the final act of the tournament only moments after Ash erases Saiki from existence. She yells her protest to his selfish decision, stating that she wanted to bring Ash back home with her. When he disappears with his apologies, Elisabeth mourns over the only memento he left behind: his headband.\r\n\r\nShe attacks with a short ranged [[riding crop]]. She also uses magical light powers to trick and trap others.

Even though an Orochi Hakkesshu member's duty is to resurrect Orochi, Yamazaki shows little to no interest in doing so. He just wants to live his life as a criminal.\r\n\r\nHe fights using dirty brawling tactics, such as kicking sand into an opponent's eye, and his always present [[knife]]. He can also stretch his left arm like a snake for extra range and turn his right arm into a [[drill]] (but this drill can only be seen in one of his (Super) Desperation Moves).","is_locked":false,"other_names":["山崎竜二"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":38382,"created_at":"2012-10-03T02:10:34.735-04:00","updated_at":"2017-02-18T23:05:21.289-05:00","title":"adelheid_bernstein","body":"Often shortened as \"Adel\", the son of the late [[Rugal Bernstein]], and [[brother and sister|brother]] to Rugal's daughter [[Rose Bernstein|Rose]].\r\n\r\nThe siblings reside on an airship called \"Sky Noah\". In [[The King of Fighters 2003]], he would challenge fighters there at the behest of his sister. His story in [[The King of Fighters XI]] implies that he faced the Ikari Warriors Team and was defeated by them. He peacefully chats with [[Heidern]] and explains that he is only following his father's legacy. In his ending for the game, he seems to appear regretful for his actions and yells at his sister for insulting his opponents.\r\n\r\nThe Console Edition of [[The King of Fighters XIII]] reveals more of Adel's cooperation with Heidern (in which he addresses him as \"Colonel Heidern\") as he tries to help the forces of good suppress the evil plans of Those from the Past. When Rose is finally freed, he reassures his sister he would punish those responsible for her subjugation.\r\n\r\nHis style is very similar to his father Rugal's. Unlike his father, his moves are faster and is also easier to chain. On the other hand, his moves are significantly weaker in priority.
