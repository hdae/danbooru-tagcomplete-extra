Quebec French (also known as Québécois) is the predominant variety, having some differences (primarily in pronunciations and vocabulary) when compared to European French. \r\n\r\nThe province was settled by Paleo-Indians during the Last Glacial Maximum and was first explored by Europeans under Jacques Cartier in 1534, who would claim it for the Kingdom of France. France would continue to hold on to the colony until 1763, when ownership of the colony was transferred to the United Kingdom after the French and Indian War (AKA the Seven Years' War). It would later join the Dominion of Canada in 1867. In 1960, the Quiet Revolution would achieve major reforms throughout the province.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Québec is Québec City (French: Ville de Québec) and the largest cities are [[Montreal|Montréal]], Gatineau, Trois-Rivières, and Sherbrooke. \r\n\r\nQuébec is the birthplace of [[poutine]] and is known for helping to popularize the sport of [[ice hockey]].\r\n\r\nh4.

She wears a grey thigh-length [[sleeveless]] and skirted [[wetsuit]] with green accents. Her garb changes with each remodel: As [[uit-25 (kancolle)|U.IT.25]] (or \"Ui\"), she gains [[arm warmers]], red, white, and black shoulder pads, and a black hairband. Then, upon becoming [[i-504 (kancolle)|I-504]] (or \"Go\"), she reverts to her white hairband, but is otherwise reduced to nothing else but a [[white one-piece swimsuit|white]] [[school swimsuit]]. Despite the changes in wardrobe, her standard submarine [[machinery]], with its grey and green livery, mostly stays the same.\r\n\r\nLuigi Torelli has the unique distinction in the game as the shipgirl to serve all three Axis powers, representing one of the two ships that ever did so (the other being another Italian submarine [[Comandante Cappellini (kancolle)|]]). The historical submarine originally patrolled the Mediterranean Sea, sinking and damaging Greek and British commercial ships before surviving an attack by Vickers Wellington bombers using Leigh light on June 3, 1942. Due to her dimensions, she was deemed fit for long travels and thus was among seven submarines sent to the Far East in 1943, retaining her Italian crew despite being under Kriegsmarine command. After the new Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies the same year, the historal [i]Luigi Torelli[/i] was passed to full German command under the name [i]U.IT.25[/i] and took part in German war operations in the Pacific. After Germany's surrender in 1945, ex-[i]Luigi Torelli[/i]'s IJN custodians then took over control, renaming her [i]I-504[/i]. She was under the Japanese flag when she shot down a B-25 Mitchell bomber near the very end of the World War II in the Pacific, allegedly the last Axis naval success. She was captured by American forces in Kobe at the conclusion of the war and eventually scuttled by the US Navy in the Kii Channel on April 16, 1946.\r\n\r\nh4.
