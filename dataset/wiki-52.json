He became a sensation, receiving many visitors and a plethora of online fanart depicting him alongside Hululu and even a visit from Hululu's anime voice actress, [[Chikuta Ikuko]].\r\n\r\nHe was distinguishable from other Humboldt penguins at the Tobu Zoo by the purple [[armband]] on his left flipper.\r\n\r\nAccording to zoo staff, Grape used to have a wife called Midori (distinguished from her green flipper band, [i]midori[/i] being the Japanese word for that color), but at some point she abandoned Grape-kun and found a new lover— a rather exceptional occurrence in a species that usually forms lifelong pair bonds, and a source of suggestion as to why Grape-kun grew so attached to the Hululu cutout.\r\n\r\nGrape-kun passed away from a sudden illness on October 12, 2017, at the age of 21. A temporary message board was set up near his enclosure for visitors to leave parting words, and many additionally left gifts such as artwork and flowers.\r\n\r\nh4.

In January 2007, railway officials decided to officially name Tama the station master. As station master, her primary duty was to greet passengers. The position came with a station master's hat; in lieu of a salary, the railway provided Tama with cat food. At the time, the local railway line was almost bankrupt and the station was unmanned but Tama's celebrity status helped to bring the company back from the brink of financial ruin \r\n\r\nTama died on June 22nd 2015 of apparent heart failure at the age of 16 at an animal hospital in Wakayama Prefecture. After her passing, thousands of her fans from all over Japan came to pay their respect.
