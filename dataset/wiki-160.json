Notable traits of his include his [[purple hair]], [[breastplate|golden chestplate]], and an [[Cross Scar|X-Shaped]] [[scar]] on his forehead.\r\n\r\nKrauser is a powerful fighter who is eager to fight strong opponents. In [[Fatal Fury 2]], he arranges his own King of Fighters tournament, in hopes of fighting strong opponents. He injures several veteran fighters from the previous King of Fighters tournament and he also hires three fighters to serve him who are [[Billy Kane]], [[Axel Hawk]], and [[Laurence Blood]]. Eventually, he fights [[Terry Bogard]] in the finals. After a fierce battle, Krauser is defeated and remains missing from the fighting scene. [spoiler] According to the short movie, Memories of Stray Wolves, Krauser supposedly took his own life soon after. [/spoiler]\r\n\r\nIn The King of Fighters series, nothing was heard of from Krauser until [[The King of Fighters '96]] tournament, when Krauser joined forces with Geese and [[mr big (snk)|Mr. Big]] to create the Boss Team. Although Geese used both him and Mr. Big as pawns in his attempt to nab an ancient power called [[orochi (kof)|Orochi]], Krauser only cared about self-improvement. After learning of his faults at the hands of Terry, Krauser vowed only to fight stronger opponents in order to restore the strength and prestige he once possessed. For now, Krauser wants only to improve himself first.\r\n\r\n* The infamous SNK boss and King of Fighters character; [[Rugal Bernstein]], uses one of Krauser's signature moves, the [b][i][i]Kaiser Wave[/i][/i][/b].\r\n* His debut theme is \"Dies Irae\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_Irae.\r\n* He is one of the only SNK characters to be fully voiced in English by an English voice actor (B.J.

Rei, who developed unusual powers, traveled the new land in search of Mirai.\r\n\r\nBut when she found her, a woman who calls herself Anamnesis appears.\r\n\r\nRei discovered that she is the one who brought herself and her sister to this world, and fought Anamnesis in an attempt to return to reality. However, her powers had only just developed, and her power of reason began to slip away as she lost control. As if to ridicule Rei, Anamnesis departs.\r\n\r\nWorried about her sister’s disturbed state, Mirai extended a hand to Rei. “It’s alright now. Oh, I wish we could hold hands again, big sister.”\r\n\r\nThe out of control Rei tried to take Mirai’s hand, but with that hand she unwittingly killed her.\r\n\r\nUnable to believe she killed her own sister, a devil appeared before the confused Rei and proclaimed: when the dead Mirai’s spirit reaches the deepest realm of limbo, Mirai will disappear. If Rei acts as a proxy for the devil and does as he asks, she may be able to revive Mirai before it is too late.\r\n\r\nRei hears the devil’s words, and decides she will do anything to save Mirai.

Unlike most tower defense games, players can move around the what they're protecting (in this case, Princess Lola) as they fight the horde of monsters that come their way. The game also features many references and parodies to classic video game tropes and 80's Japanese pop-culture.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the game received a sequel in the form of [i][[minna de mamotte knight: hime no tokemeki rhapsody|Minna de Mamotte Knight: Hime no Tokemeki Rhapsody]][/i], released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop, and was later localized in 2016 over under the name [i]Gotta Protectors![/i].\r\n\r\nh4.

The pattern depicts a thick teal jagged brushstroke on a white background with a much thinner purple brushstroke on top of the first stroke. This design has become synonymous with 1990's nostalgia and has been both photoshopped and actually applied to a variety of items such as clothing, tablets, smart phones, game consoles, cars and more.\r\n\r\nIt was first used by the Sweetheart Cup Company, where it was designed by an employee named Gina Ekiss who submitted the pattern in an internal company contest in 1989. After being picked the winner, the design was printed on products starting in 1992. The Sweetheart Cup Company was later acquired by the Solo Cup Company in 2004, who continued to use the pattern on their products.\r\n\r\nh4.
