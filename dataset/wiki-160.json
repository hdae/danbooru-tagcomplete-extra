Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air [[missile]] from the late 1950s until the 1990s. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM.\r\n\r\nThe early Sparrow was intended primarily for use against larger targets, especially bombers and had numerous operational limitations in other uses. Against smaller targets, the need to receive a strong reflected radar signal made achieving lock-on at the [[missile]]'s effective range difficult. As the launching [[aircraft]]'s own radar needed to be pointed at the target throughout the engagement, this meant that in fighter-vs-fighter combat, the enemy fighter would often approach within the range of shorter-range infrared homing missiles while the launching aircraft had to continue flying towards its target. Additionally, early models were only effective against targets at roughly the same or higher altitudes, below which reflections from the ground became a problem.\r\n\r\nA number of upgraded Sparrow designs were developed to address these issues. In the early 1970s, the [[royal_air_force|RAF]] developed a version with an inverse monopulse seeker and improved motor known as Skyflash, while the Italian Air Force introduced the similar Aspide. Both had the ability to be fired at targets below the launching fighter (\"look-down, shoot down\"), were more resistant to countermeasures, and were much more accurate in the terminal phase. This basic concept was then made part of the US Sparrows in the M model (for monopulse) and some of these were later updated as the P model, the last to be produced in the US. Aspides sold to [[China]] resulted in the locally produced PL10.

Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (型, [i]kata[/i]) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (乱取り, [i]randori[/i]).\r\n\r\nThe philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from koryū (古流, \"traditional schools\").

The system takes a top-attack flight profile against armored vehicles, attacking the usually thinner top armor, but can also make a direct attack.  The Javelin's tandem HEAT warhead is capable of defeating modern tanks equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor.\r\n\r\nThe system consists of three main components: the Command Launch Unit, the Launch Tube Assembly and the missile itself.  The reusable Command Launch Unit commonly referred to as a CLU (pronounced \"clue\") is the targeting component of the system. The CLU has three views which are used to find, target, and fire the missile and may also be used separately from the missile as a portable thermal sight.  The disposable Launch Tube Assembly has built in electronics and a locking hinge system that makes attachment and detachment of the missile to and from the Command Launch Unit quick and simple.\r\n\r\nh4.

Originally meant to be a dogfighter but grew more into the role of ground attack as the wars progressed.\r\n\r\nThe Corsair is easily identified by its huge size- easily twice the size of the zero, something rather unusual for carrier-borne aircraft. Its propeller is the largest ever put on a single-seat fighter, measuring at 13 feet from tip to tip. Consequently its nose was so big that the craft was barred from service until pilots could be trained to land on a curved arc (in fact, this was what led to the Corsair being released for [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] use where they outmatched IJN aviators flying Zeroes). While there were two Navy squadrons that still flew Corsairs when they were first deployed, one soon switched to [[F6F Hellcat]] use while the other (VF-17 of [[Bunker Hill (Azur Lane)|]]) was removed from the carrier until November 1943.\r\n\r\nIt can also be identified by its gull wing, which swoops down before angling upward, giving the plane a unique silhouette and elegant appearance. This was done solely to keep the massive prop from striking the ground during takeoff and landing, but it also gave the plane uncommon dive and climb characteristics that pilots exploited, as well as a signature whistle during a dive.\r\n\r\nDespite the Corsair's early troubles caused by its massive power and hog nose, pilots eventually adapted and it became highly successful, finishing the war with a kill ratio of 1-12 (in its favor).\r\n\r\nh4.

She famously relates to the tale of the missing sun deity, Amaterasu Omikami. Her name can also be pronounced as Ama-no-Uzume.[1][2]\r\n\r\nAmaterasu's brother, the storm god Susano'o, had vandalized her rice fields, threw a flayed horse at her loom, and brutally killed one of her maidens due to a quarrel between them. In turn, Amaterasu became furious with him and retreated into the Heavenly Rock Cave, Amano-Iwato. The world, without the illumination of the sun, became dark and the gods could not lure Amaterasu out of her hiding place.\r\n\r\nThe clever Uzume overturned a tub near the cave entrance and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other deities. They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight.[3] This dance is said to have founded the Japanese ritual dance, Kagura. [4]\r\n\r\nAmaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what all the fuss was about. When she opened the cave, she saw her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly emerged from her hiding spot.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo-no-mikoto dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat. Another god tied a magic shimenawa across the entrance.[5] The deities Ame-no-Koyane-no-mikoto and Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto then asked Amaterasu to rejoin the divine. She agreed, and light was restored to the earth.\r\n\r\nAme-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto is still worshiped today as a Shinto kami, spirits indigenous to Japan.[6] She is also known as Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, The Great Persuader, and The Heavenly Alarming Female.[7] She is depicted in kyōgen farce as Okame, a woman who revels in her sensuality\r\n\r\n---\r\nComplete \"Wikipedia\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto for links to more information\r\n\r\nh4.
