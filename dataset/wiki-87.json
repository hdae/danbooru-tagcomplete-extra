Several types of war fans were used by the samurai class of feudal Japan and each had a different look and purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of war fan:\r\n\r\nGunsen (軍扇) were folding fans used by the average warriors to cool themselves off. They were made of wood, bronze, brass or a similar metal for the inner spokes, and often used thin iron or other metals for the outer spokes or cover, making them lightweight but strong. Warriors would hang their fans from a variety of places, most typically from the belt or the breastplate, though the latter often impeded the use of a sword or a bow. Example: post #2540638\r\n\r\n[[Tessen]] (鉄扇) were folding fans with outer spokes made of heavy plates of iron which were designed to look like normal, harmless folding fans or solid clubs shaped to look like a closed fan. Samurai could take these to places where swords or other overt weapons were not allowed, and some swordsmanship schools included training in the use of the tessen as a weapon. The tessen was also used for fending off knives and darts, as a throwing weapon, and as an aid in swimming. Example: post #1904493\r\n\r\n[[Gunbai]] (Gumbai), Gunpai (Gumpai) or dansen uchiwa (軍配) were large solid open fans that could be solid iron, metal with wooden core, or solid wood, which were carried by high-ranking officers. They were used to ward off arrows, as a sunshade, and to signal to troops. Also used by scoring referees in sumo wrestling matches.

First introduced in the PC RTS game [[Dawn of War]], the chapter have since appeared in both the tabletop and other 40k games as well. The chapter is known from their red armor and their emblem, a raven with a blood drop on its chest.\r\n\r\nWhile generally well received amongst (most of) the Imperium for their protective nature over civilians and eagerness to deal death to the enemies of the Imperium, the Techpriests of Mars and the Inquisition due to their voracious appetite for knowledge, learning and artifacts in particular, the Blood Ravens have a mixed reputation amongst the other Space Marine chapters due to both their strategies (favoring extensive recon, meticulous planning and pinpoint assaults on key enemy vulnerabilities) and their Chapter-wide tendency to produce almost unprecedented numbers of psykers and Librarians. The Space Wolves (who favor strategies involving charges and overwhelming the foe in massed melee) infamously do not tolerate Blood Raven procedures at all, with physical altercations being recorded between the two chapters at command-level meetings.\r\n\r\nAs a second-founding chapter with no official records prior to M37K, the Blood Ravens do not (again officially) have a recognizable Primarch. However, their color scheme, tendency to produce psykers and culture surrounding the acquisition of knowledge strongly suggest that they are descendants of [[Magnus the Red]], making them loyalists of the [[Thousand Sons]] traitor legion. This would also make them an indirect relative chapter of the [[Grey Knight]]s due to sharing a Founder in Janus.\r\n\r\nAs the Blood Raven arsenal contains some phenomenally unlikely artifacts (Gear belonging to the Custodes and [i]Primarchs[/i] to name but a few) that would have been under enough security to make their theft near impossible, the Blood Ravens gained the fandom reputation of being able to perform implausible acts of indefinite borrowing, such as swapping places with a Land Raider's driver while he's still inside the cockpit, acquiring Bjorn the Fell-handed's Dreadnaught for combat use (with Bjorn catching on quickly to his new circumstances and happily embracing the chance to go back to war) and involuntarily renting the Golden Throne of Terra. \r\n\r\nThe chapter have been jokingly called \"The Bloody Magpies\" by fans due to how the chapter are constantly gifted (or 'gifted', due to those same chapters not having any records stating that they ever gave the Ravens anything)  rare, powerful weapons and gear from other older chapters.  \r\nDue to their memetic shenanigans, gateway status to the 40k world and generally being a interesting chapter, the Blood Ravens are well-regarded amongst the fandom - even if the jokes about rampant theft get a little repetitive.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174176,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:37.940-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:37.940-04:00","title":"hiraga_raizou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["平賀雷蔵"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174175,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:13.627-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:13.627-04:00","title":"suzukaze_miharu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["涼風美晴"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174174,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:42:52.208-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:42:52.208-04:00","title":"candy_&_cigarettes","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キャンディ&シガレッツ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":148110,"created_at":"2022-08-06T18:58:17.855-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T12:18:33.479-04:00","title":"ariel_(yu-gi-oh!)","body":"An umbrella tag for variations of the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] [[duel monster]] Gishki Ariel who was originally printed in 2011 and has received new forms throughout the years. \r\n\r\nh4.

This game features the characters as mostly SD chibis and is not graphic like the other games are.\r\n\r\n[i]Splatterhouse Remake[/i] (not official title), was released on November 23rd of 2010 for Western markets and is a 3D third person remake of the first game.\r\n\r\nIn the games, the player controls [[rick_(splatterhouse)|Rick Taylor]], a man who has, through his fusion with an Evil Mask, become extremely strong and who resembles to a great degree [[Jason Voorhees]], of the [[Friday the 13th]] movies.\r\n\r\nThe games take place in a variety of locations, but all have a common setting, in and around a frightening mansion filled with disgusting demons and monsters.\r\n\r\nThe point of the games, with the exception of part 3, is to save Rick's girlfriend, [[Jennifer (Splatterhouse)|]], who has been targeted for one reason or another by the various demons and evil forces that inhabit the game's localities. \r\n\r\nIn part 3 the player must use the map to find and save both Jennifer and their child from the demons, so it differs from the other games, which are mostly 2d side scrolling. Part 3 differs also because time limits are in place for the family saving mission portions of the game. Part 3 also differs in that Rick can 'power up' himself for a brief time to use vastly increased physical power to do drastic damage, as well as using some special moves. Finally, part 3 differs because enemies can be grabbed and slammed, headbutted, etc.\r\n\r\nRick can punch, kick, jump, equip various melee weapons, and perform a sliding kick. In most instances, his strength is evidenced by the brutal mutilation of the enemies due to the hitting power of his attacks. For example, zombie like enemies burst in half when struck. In part 2 and 3, it is revealed that the mask which granted him this power has an infernal, evil personality.\r\n\r\nWeapons include: 2x4, Lead Pipe, Explosive Potion, Cleaver, Shotgun, Rock, and others.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested by the storyline of the first two games that the monsters have come about due to an unholy mix of science and magic and that the mask is a conduit of some ancient, hellish force that is not specifically named but that has much to do, albeit in the background, with the monsters and demons being there in the first place.\r\n\r\nPlay-through videos are avaliable at www.youtube.com.\r\n\r\nSources: Wikipedia pages.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スプラッターハウス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":173617,"created_at":"2023-09-30T03:40:47.663-04:00","updated_at":"2023-09-30T03:40:47.663-04:00","title":"yarofes:2023","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["野郎フェス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":141332,"created_at":"2022-04-08T16:30:43.647-04:00","updated_at":"2023-09-30T03:18:00.737-04:00","title":"paripi_koumei","body":"An ongoing 2019-to-present manga series written by [b]Yotsuba Yuuto[/b] with art by [[Ogawa Ryou]].
