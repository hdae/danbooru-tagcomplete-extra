Each level has relatively distinct themes and gimmicks, with some reoccurring elements, including enemies such as [[Forknight]]s or [[Stupid Rat (pizza tower)|]]s. Each floor has at least one secret room in the hub area, one featuring the Noise's girlfriend, [[Noisette (pizza tower)|]]. \r\n\r\nThe second floor features the level Fun Farm, which involves special guest [[Mort (mort the chicken)|Mort the Chicken]] from the 2000 PS1 game of the [[mort the chicken|same name]], who is prominently featured in that level's title card. This inspired a wave of title card art featuring Peppino crossing over with various other properties.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["PizzaTower","ピザ・タワー","ピザタワー","피자타워","披萨塔","pizza_tower","pizzatowerfanart","pizzatowertitlecards"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":217415,"created_at":"2024-11-28T21:30:45.847-05:00","updated_at":"2024-11-28T21:30:45.847-05:00","title":"camille_montes","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["カミーユ・モンテス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":217414,"created_at":"2024-11-28T21:30:38.586-05:00","updated_at":"2024-11-28T21:30:38.586-05:00","title":"quantum_of_solace","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["慰めの報酬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":217413,"created_at":"2024-11-28T21:29:33.104-05:00","updated_at":"2024-11-28T21:29:33.104-05:00","title":"daniel_craig","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ダニエル・クレイグ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":39909,"created_at":"2012-11-07T18:14:07.151-05:00","updated_at":"2024-11-28T21:28:13.684-05:00","title":"james_bond","body":"The main character of the [[james bond (series)|James Bond series]].

Afterwards, various types of eboshi were born, e.g. [i]Kazaori eboshi (Samurai eboshi), Okina eboshi[/i], etc. [i]Tate eboshi[/i] is the best-known one. This headdress came about in the \"Heian period\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period based on headgear known as a [i]hashiha-kouburi[/i] (圭冠).\r\n\r\nKanmuri are official hats worn in the imperial court and eboshi are casual headdresses worn by the nobility and it was also worn by the normal people. The Mikado never uses an eboshi. [b]Danbooru currently does not distinguish [i]eboshi[/i] from ancient Japanese [i]kanmuri[/i] (冠).[/b]\r\n\r\nPhysically, the kanmuri stands out thanks to the \"koji (巾子)\", a cylindrical shape that stands upright from the top of the headwear, and the \"ei (纓)\", string-shaped cloth which hangs down from the rear of the headwear towards the wearer's back. The Japanese at the time when kanmuri were still simple sack-like shapes had a topknot on their head. They wore kanmuri by putting the topknot through a tube and binding the root of the topknot wearing this sack and letting the rest of the string hang down their backs. The terms \"koji\" and \"ei\", which were used even when the shape and quality of the kanmuri changed, serve as a reminder of this older form. \r\n\r\nNotably worn by [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Soga no Tojiko]] of the [[Touhou]] series.\r\n\r\nh4.

At the time of The Battle of Pearl Harbor, she was assigned to Destroyer Division 5 (alongside sister-ships [[Harukaze (kancolle)|]] and [[Asakaze (kancolle)|]]). As one of the more obsolete classes of destroyers, her early-war career was spent escorting troop transports for invasions, although in the Battle of Sunda Straight, she helped sink an auxiliary minesweeper.\r\n\r\nThroughout the middle of the war (1943-1944), [i]Matsukaze[/i] was engaged in \"Tokyo Express\" expeditions. [i]Matsukaze[/i] was at Truk during Operation Hailstone, but survived with no direct hits from major ordinance.
