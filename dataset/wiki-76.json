[i]Trigger[/i] later began streaming the short with English subtitles on YouTube from April 19, 2013.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 2013, Trigger announced at [[Anime Expo]] that a new episode, tentatively titled [i][b]Little Witch Academia 2[/b][/i], would be developed in response to the reception the first episode received. The project will begin production in late 2013 following the airing of [[Kill la Kill]], with a goal to release it for winter 2014. Whilst initially having the funds for a twenty minute episode, Trigger launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to extend its runtime by fifteen minutes. The Kickstarter was launched on July 9, 2013 and met its $150,000 goal within five hours. A stretch goal of $500,000 was added to produce a making of documentary and audio commentary for the Bluray release. The Kickstarter raised a total of $625,518. Ootsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full length film. A television series was eventually made for the series in Winter 2017, and was premiered on Netflix.\r\n\r\nh4.

A [[apex legends mobile|smartphone port]] developed in collaboration with Tencent's LightSpeed Studios was released in 2022, though it ultimately shut down in 2023. The port was treated as a separate game entirely and featured exclusive cosmetics and legends.\r\n\r\nIt quickly gained mass popularity, rivaling contemporaries such as [[Overwatch]], [[Playerunknown's Battlegrounds|PUBG]] & [[Fortnite]] in player & streaming view count. The game is notably very popular in Japan, where first-person shooters typically have difficulty finding a large following. It is the favorite game of many [[virtual YouTuber]]s and eSports players, with both [[Hololive]]/[[Holostars]] and [[Nijisanji]] having several talents who dedicate most of their stream time to playing it.\r\n\r\nDespite not featuring the parkour and mecha elements of the main series, Apex Legends is considered a canon part of the [[Titanfall (series)|]] franchise. Due to how it's largely treated as a separate entity with its own spin-offs, the Titanfall series tag should not be added to Apex posts unless there's a direct reference beyond the shared weapons.\r\n\r\nh4.

leader of [[Malawi]] from 1961 to 1994.\r\n\r\n After receiving much of his education overseas, Banda returned to his home country (then British Nyasaland) to speak against colonialism and advocate independence. In 1963 he was formally appointed prime minister of Nyasaland and, a year later, led the country to independence as Malawi. Two years later he proclaimed Malawi a republic with himself as president. He consolidated power and later declared Malawi a one-party state under the [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP). In 1970 the MCP made him the party's President for Life. In 1971 he became President for Life of Malawi itself.\r\n\r\nAs a leader of the pro-Western bloc in Africa he received support from the West during the [[Cold War]]. He generally supported women's rights, improved the country's infrastructure and maintained a good educational system relative to other African countries but also presided over one of the most repressive regimes in Africa. His government regularly tortured and murdered political opponents. Human rights groups estimate that at least 6,000 people were killed, tortured and jailed without trial. As many as 18,000 people were killed during his rule according to one estimate. He was scorned for maintaining full diplomatic relations with apartheid-era [[South Africa]].\r\n\r\nBy 1993 he was facing international pressure and widespread protest. A referendum ended his one-party state and a special assembly ended his life-term presidency, stripping him of most of his powers. Banda ran for president in the democratic elections which followed and was defeated. He died in South Africa in 1997.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヘイスティングズ・カムズ・バンダ","ヘイスティングズ・バンダ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194931,"created_at":"2024-06-01T16:07:46.253-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T16:08:08.064-04:00","title":"iran-iraq_war","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["イラン・イラク戦争","イライラ戦争","イ・イ戦争","(ペルシャ)湾岸戦争","第一次湾岸戦争"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":87703,"created_at":"2017-07-03T13:03:33.859-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T16:06:26.950-04:00","title":"niqab","body":"A [[veil]] worn by some Islamic women.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ニカブ","نقاب","روبند"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":104862,"created_at":"2019-03-24T11:45:33.291-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T15:46:07.444-04:00","title":"higokumaru","body":"[[Honkai Impact 3rd]] character.

Since Japan stopped producing cylindrical postboxes in 1970 and has been replacing them with rectangular ones, the older cylindrical design has gained cultural and sentimental value, and a few are being preserved.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly shown design is the Postal submissions box No. 1 (round) 「郵便差出箱1号（丸型）」, dating from 1949. [Not to be confused with the 1970 submissions box No. 1 (rectangular) 「郵便差出箱1号（角型）」.]\r\nThe letter slot is cut into a circular panel on the upper section of the postbox, and is shielded by a curved eave. Collection times are posted on the collection plate, to one side of the circular panel. A square access hatch sits on the lower section of the postbox, below the letter slot. Unlike later, rectangular designs in which mail gets deposited directly into a mailbag that can be removed via a large door, the cylindrical design required loose mail items to be collected by hand through its relatively smaller hatch. This inefficiency led to it being phased out.\r\n\r\nThis tag is [b]not[/b] intended for all cylindrical postboxes. Some artistic liberty is allowed, such as variation in size and proportion, or missing/misplaced collection plate or access hatch, but the general design elements must be there. (e.g. post #1109518, despite the [[Japanese postal mark]] and small access hatch, more closely resembles a UK design in terms of shape and letter slot placement.)\r\n\r\nh4.

The Goonies II was released in North America, Europe, and Australia, although the original was one of the NES games released as part of the Nintendo VS. System arcade machine in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nThe Goonies II has little to do with the film. In it, the Fratellis have kidnapped all the Goonies (except [[mikey_(the_goonies)|Mikey]], whom the player guides) and have hidden them in cages across a terrain of caverns, mazes, and abandoned buildings. As Mikey, the player must rescue them all and ultimately free a mermaid named [[annie_(the_goonies)|Annie]]. Mikey was also a playable character in Konami's 1988 Famicom title Wai Wai World, which included a Goonies-themed level.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* \"Music Video\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxLhytQ67fs","is_locked":false,"other_names":["グーニーズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194563,"created_at":"2024-05-27T17:37:37.217-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:37:37.217-04:00","title":"onda_aka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["恩田赤"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":26117,"created_at":"2011-03-23T15:14:29.803-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:08:35.682-04:00","title":"leaning_back","body":"When a character who is either standing or sitting, leans backwards at the waist.
