The film stars [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Michael Fassbender]], Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green and Charlize Theron. \r\n\r\nSet in the late 21st century, the story centers on the crew of the [[spacecraft]] Prometheus as they follow a star map discovered among the remnants of several ancient Earth civilizations. Led to a distant world and an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the crew seeks the origins of humanity, but instead discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe film began development in the early 2000s as a fifth entry in the Alien franchise, with both Scott and director [[James Cameron]] developing ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science fiction horror film [[alien (1979)|Alien]]. James Cameron eventually left the project to focus in his sci-fi film [[avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]].\r\n\r\nBy late 2010, Ridley Scott brought Lindelof onto the project to rewrite Spaihts' script, and together they developed a separate story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, though the film shares \"strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak\", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe and June 8, 2012 in the United States and Canada.

The game is known for its peculiar sense of humor.  It was created by a single author, but was abandoned unfinished.  It has since been taken up as an open-source project by multiple modders as \"Elona+\" and received expansions, but the original plot is likely never to be finished as it was intended.\r\n\r\n\"Elona\" is a portmanteau of \"Eternal League Of NefiA\", a mysterious (to the point of being only mentioned once in the unfinished plot) organization apparently behind fate. \r\n\r\nElona takes place on a world called Irva, where the world is tormented by the blowing of the etherwinds, which cause mutations that kill humanoids and make monsters more powerful and ferocious.  Because the etherwinds come from the Vindale Forest, home of the [[elf]]-like Elea, the world stands ready to bring war to Vindale.\r\n\r\nElona blends standard RPG tropes with a Lovecraftian theme (including a Sanity meter).  It also features guns, cyborgs, steampunk, references to the likes of [[Aliens (1986)|]] and [[Bioshock (series)|]] and many other dissimilar tropes to create an oddball fantasy/sci-fi kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nYou can read a translation of the plot here: [s]http://elona.squares.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5025 [/s]\r\nh4.

After graduating from Art School Syd worked for many advertising agencies and as a car designer and concept artist for car companies in the 50s. Later he was hired by [[NASA]] in the 60s to make [[realistic]] depictions and pre-visualization work on several [[real life]] [[spacecraft]] projects (which would help him greatly to develop techniques he would later apply to his very sober, sound, detailed and realistic looking science fiction works).   \r\n\r\nSyd Mead would become best known for his designs for 80s film productions such as [[Blade Runner]] (the [[Spinner]]), [[Aliens (1986)|]] (the [[Sulaco]] [[spacecraft]]), [[Tron]] (the lightcycles, digital tanks, solar sailer, and Sark's carrier designs) and [[2010 (book)|]] (the Leonov spaceship), all of which gave him notoriety in the field. In the 90s he also worked on the designs for the [[Turn A Gundam]] [[mecha]] anime series and the aborted [[Yamato2520]] (a sequel to [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]]).\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 2019, Syd died in his Pasadena home at the age of 86, after three years of fighting lymphoma.\r\n\r\nh4.

The original Contra videogames were influenced by many [[Science fiction]] and action films from the 80s, most notably [[commando_(movie)|Commando]], the [[Rambo]] movies and [[Aliens (1986)|]].\r\n\r\nThe in-universe use of the term \"Contra\" is first explained within the Japanese instruction card of the arcade version of Contra, and reiterated in most games (including Contra: Shattered Soldier), as \"a title awarded to a superior soldier possessing almost super human drive and ability, while excelling in guerrilla tactics\".\r\n\r\nThe arcade version of Contra was released in February 20, 1987, a few months after the Iran-Contra affair was made public. While it is unclear whether the game was deliberately named after the Nicaraguan Contra rebels (since the company that made the game is Japanese and not American), the ending theme of the original game was titled \"Sandinista\" (サンディニスタ?), after the adversaries of the real-life Contras.\r\n\r\nA home version was released for the [[NES]] home console in 1988, along with ports for various computer formats, including the MSX2. The home versions were localized in the PAL region as [b][i]Gryzor[/i][/b] on the various computer formats and as [[Probotector]] on the European NES, released long later. Several Contra sequels were produced following the original game.\r\n\r\nh4.List of games\r\n\r\n* [[Contra]]\r\n* [[Super Contra]]\r\n* [[Contra III The Alien Wars]]\r\n* [[Contra Hard Corps]]\r\n* [[Contra: Shattered Soldier]]\r\n* [[Neo Contra]]\r\n* [[Contra Dual Spirits]]\r\n* [[Contra Rebirth]]\r\n* [[Hard Corps: Uprising]]\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Bill Rizer]]\r\n* [[Lance Bean]]\r\n* [[Lucia (Contra)]]\r\n* [[Mad Dog (Contra)]]\r\n* [[Scorpion (Contra)]]\r\n* [[Probotector]]\r\n* [[Ray Poward]]\r\n* [[Brad Fang]] \r\n* [[Browny]]  \r\n* [[Sheena Etranzi]]\r\n* [[yagyuu_jaguar_genbei|Genbei Yagyu]]\r\n* [[Bahamut (Hard Corps)]]\r\n* [[Geo Mandrake]]\r\n* [[Deadeye Joe]]\r\n* [[Harley Daniels]] \r\n* [[Krystal (Hard Corps)]] \r\n* [[Sayuri (Hard Corps)]]\r\n* [[red_falcon_(contra)|Red Falcon]]\r\n* [[Kimkoh]]\r\n\r\n* [[BLAZING CHROME]] - A recent [[video game]] heavily inspired by Contra.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["魂斗羅","コントラ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30071,"created_at":"2011-11-03T23:48:35.870-04:00","updated_at":"2024-02-02T06:39:32.860-05:00","title":"lance_bean","body":"A main character and hero from the [[Contra]] videogame series.\r\n\r\n[b]Lance Bean[/b] was modeled after the look of actor [[Sylvester Stallone]] in the [[Rambo]] movie series.\r\n\r\nHis name is a tribute to actors [b]Lance[/b] Henriksen and Michael [b]Biehn[/b], who appeared in the movie [[Aliens (1986)|]].\r\n\r\n[[Bill Rizer]] is Lance's best friend and brother in arms.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":35121,"created_at":"2012-06-04T23:51:19.144-04:00","updated_at":"2024-02-02T06:39:32.844-05:00","title":"m56_smartgun","body":"A fictional futuristic weapon that first appeared in the [[Aliens (1986)|]] science fiction and horror film from the 80s.\r\n\r\nThe [b]M56 Smartgun[/b] is a self-targeting heavy [[machine gun]] attached to a harness that is used as a squad support weapon by the [[Colonial Marine]] Corps. \r\n\r\nAn optical sensor in the gun detects moving targets previously programmed as such in a computer stored in the chest armor of the operator.

Luke was designed to appeal the \"new generation\" of players by depicting him enjoying various hobby and modern culture, including playing video games. He is also depicted as a rival to the fellow hot-blooded fighter [[Jamie Siu]] since their childhood.\r\n\r\nLuke's initial reception by fans were mixed-to-negative, as he was set up by [[Capcom]] to succeed [[Ryu (street fighter)|]] as the new leading cast of the franchise, though his popularity gradually improves, partly due to his English voice actor, Aleks Le, who has done various [[meme]] and shitposting video about him using his Luke character and often interact with the fanbase in various Luke-related tweets.\r\n\r\nh5. Official bio\r\n\r\nA contractor for a PMC, Luke uses his elite military background to teach mixed martial arts. His days off are spent eating junk food, playing PC video games, and fighting, but make no mistake—Luke plays to win.\r\n\r\n* [b]Hates:[/b] Terrorism, horror games\r\n* [b]Likes:[/b] Travelling, PC games, wacky T-shirts, his late father\r\n* [b]Height:[/b] 185cm / 6'1 \r\n* [b]Weight:[/b] 90kg / 198 lbs","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ルーク・サリバン","ルーク(ストリートファイター)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":183536,"created_at":"2024-02-02T00:53:36.920-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-02T00:57:46.610-05:00","title":"mister_darling_(honeyworks)","body":"A song from the [[Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai]] franchise by [[HoneyWorks]], featuring [[Narumi Ayako]] and [[Narumi Yuusuke]].\r\n\r\nh1.

It is the first game in the [[Sonic (series)|Sonic franchise]]. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. \r\n\r\nThe game features [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], who can run at supersonic speeds, setting out on a quest to defeat [[Dr. Eggman]] (Robotnik), a scientist who has imprisoned animals inside hostile [[robot]]s and seeks the powerful [[Chaos Emerald]]s. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay involves collecting [[ring (sonic)|]]s as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a new mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by [[Mario (series)|Super Mario]] series creator Miyamoto Shigeru. \r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Naka Yuji. The music was composed by Nakamura Masato, songwriter of the J-pop band [i]Dreams Come True[/i].\r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It is widely considered one of the greatest video games of all time. It was also commercially successful, becoming one of the best-selling video games of all time with approximately 24 million copies sold worldwide across all platforms. Furthermore, it established the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo]] Entertainment System console. \r\n\r\nThe game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into [[sonic the hedgehog (film)|other media]]. It was followed by [[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]] in 1992.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182982,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:47:44.141-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:47:44.141-05:00","title":"schneewittchen_(wonderland_wars)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["シュネーヴィッツェン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182981,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:39.112-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:39.112-05:00","title":"bonbonzaka_koukou_engeki-bu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ボンボン坂高校演劇部"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182980,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:27.570-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:27.570-05:00","title":"junna_shoutarou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["順菜正太郎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182978,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:29:05.634-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:29:05.634-05:00","title":"yukione","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["雪オネェ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182977,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:25:16.099-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:25:16.099-05:00","title":"chiba_ryohei","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["千葉涼平"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182976,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:05:08.955-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:05:08.955-05:00","title":"isarai_yuuki","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小衣優希"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182975,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:01:02.756-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:01:02.756-05:00","title":"ruru_(venom)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ルル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182974,"created_at":"2024-01-26T10:58:48.661-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T10:59:41.954-05:00","title":"wonder_woman_(movie)","body":"Wonder Woman is a 2017 superhero film based on the [[DC Comics]] [[wonder woman|character of the same name]].

A backronym for \"Field-on Enemy\" in Japanese. Known instead as \"Formido Oppugnatura Exsequens\" in English, replacing the Engrish with faux Latin.\r\n\r\nUnlike regular enemies, they appear in the field and have specific behaviors, like patrolling set patterns or chasing after the player. When first encountered, they are likely to easily wipe out the party; many of the puzzles in the Labyrinth revolve around avoiding encounters with them. If killed, they respawn after 3 in-game days.\r\n\r\nIn battle, different types of F.O.E have different appearances just like any other enemy, but in the DS era they all appear as a fuzzy orange ball in the field. This led to an association with [[Kedama (touhou)|]] from Touhou.
