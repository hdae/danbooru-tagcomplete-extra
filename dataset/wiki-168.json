Differences include the canopy frames, the presence of a second canopy for the dedicated weapon system officer, a small leading edge extension, outward-canted vertical fins and larger engine exhausts.\r\n\r\nThe MiG-31 is slower than the MiG-25, but is better armed and has improved avionics and maneuverability.\r\n\r\nMain armament consists primarily of the R-33/AA-9 'Amos' air-to-air missile and a 23mm cannon.
