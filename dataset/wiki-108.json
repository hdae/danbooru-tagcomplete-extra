Released in 1987, it is directed by Yamaga Hiroyuki with assistant director Akai Takami. The music for the anime film was composed by the late famous musician and actor \"Sakamoto Ryuichi\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuichi_Sakamoto . [[Sadamoto Yoshiyuki]] designed the characters and [[Anno Hideaki]] worked on it as animation and special effects artist.\r\n\r\nThe animated film is set in an alternate Earth-like [[alien]] world where an industrial humanoid civilization is flourishing amid an impending war between two bordering nations: the Kingdom of Honneamise and \"The Republic\". The Kingdom of Honneamise begins the development of an experimental [[space]] program to put the [[astronaut|first man in space]] and thus creates the first [i]Royal Space Force[/i].\r\n\r\nThis epic [[science fiction]] anime movie would ultimately be a \"critically acclaimed Gainax classic\":http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wings-of-honneamise-1995 from the 80s, but it was poorly received and sold only modestly domestically and overseas. \r\n\r\nA sequel called [[Aoki Uru]] ([i]\"Blue Uru\"[/i]) was intended to be released in the 90s, but due to lack of funds, Gainax abandoned it part way through production.

He is considered one of the great masters of Romantic music. Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola, a village in the Duchy of Warsaw. A renowned child-prodigy pianist and composer, Chopin grew up in Warsaw and completed his music education there; he composed many mature works in Warsaw before leaving Poland in 1830 at age 20, shortly before the November 1830 Uprising.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Russian suppression of the Uprising, he settled in Paris as part of Poland's Great Emigration. During the remaining 19 years of his life, Chopin gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon; he supported himself by sales of his compositions and as a piano teacher. After some romantic dalliances with Polish women, including an abortive engagement, from 1837 to 1847 he carried on a relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin. For most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health; he died in Paris in 1849 at age 39.\r\n \r\nThe vast majority of Chopin's works are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces and some songs to Polish texts. His piano works are often technically demanding, with an emphasis on nuance and expressive depth. Chopin invented the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, polonaise, étude, impromptu, scherzo and prélude.\r\n\r\nh4.

Over 4,500 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976. Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are still being built for export customers. \r\n\r\nIn 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.\r\n\r\nThe Fighting Falcon is a fighter with numerous innovations including a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, a seat reclined 30 degrees to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system that makes it a highly nimble aircraft. \r\n\r\nThe F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment. The F-16's official name is \"Fighting Falcon\", but \"Viper\" is commonly used by its pilots, due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the [[Battlestar Galactica]] [[viper_(spacecraft)|Colonial Viper]] starfighter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to active duty U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard units, the aircraft is also used by the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy. The F-16 has also been procured to serve in the air forces of 25 other nations. It served as the basis for the development of the Mitsubishi [[Mitsubishi f-2]] jet fighter from [[Japan]].\r\n\r\nh4.See Also\r\n\r\n* [[List of Airplanes]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["F-16"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":134115,"created_at":"2022-01-12T05:15:56.708-05:00","updated_at":"2024-05-05T13:07:35.553-04:00","title":"mitsubishi_asm-1","body":"Type 80 Air-to-Ship Missile is an air-launched Air-to-ship [[missile]] developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
