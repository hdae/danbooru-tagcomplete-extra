Not \"ports\", just port. It only has one. Shells are loaded and ejected from the bottom of the receiver during a normal pump stroke. This clever design lends the 37 a number of advantages; for one, it's friendly to both left and right hand shooters. It is simple to mount a scope on; dirt and other potential hazards only have one possible point of entry. It also looks cool, which paired with the gun's excellent manufacturing quality means it's been in a huge number of movies; from Terminator to Aliens to The Thing and Death Wish, the Ithaca is a regular in cinema and probably always will be.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["イサカM37"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":156307,"created_at":"2023-01-13T07:05:03.681-05:00","updated_at":"2023-01-13T07:05:03.681-05:00","title":"yusen-chan_(yawaraka_yusen)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ユセンちゃん","ヤワラカユセン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":156305,"created_at":"2023-01-13T06:43:37.608-05:00","updated_at":"2023-01-13T06:43:37.608-05:00","title":"sora_(kantoku)","body":"She has [[blue eyes]], [[white ribbon|white ribbons]] and a semi-long [[brown hair]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":7144,"created_at":"2008-04-19T11:11:52.836-04:00","updated_at":"2023-01-13T05:08:54.788-05:00","title":"bursting_breasts","body":"When the [[breasts]] cause some degree of [[wardrobe malfunction]] due to the relatively small size of the clothing in comparison to her larger breast size.

The design was produced by an artist [[wakaba sprout|Wakaba]] and the voices of character were done by singer-songwriter and [[voice actor]], [[Mizuki Nana]].\r\nWithout a doubt, her basic model comes from [[OS-tan]]. However in this case, she is closer to human with a Windows 7 themed costume.\r\nSpecial wallpapers and system voices were handed out along with other goods as a bonus in PC parts retail shops to those who pre-ordered Windows 7.\r\nIn March of 2010, Nanami's character song \"七色ジェネレータ([i]Nanairo generator[/i])\" was handed out on [[CD]] as a bonus.\r\nIn May 2010, her Anime commercial started to appear in stores of Akihabara.\r\n\r\nh4.Nanami's profile\r\n\r\n* She was hired by a PC store called \"秋葉野自作商会(Akibano Home-build Computer Company)\" as a part time worker and uses twitter to spread the news of Windows 7 every morning.\r\n* She can only be found in stores during promotional campaigns because she is not a store staff.\r\n* Born in April 6th 1992. 17 years old at 2009.\r\n* 160cm tall.\r\n* Often called \"[[dojikko]]\" and \"natural airhead\".\r\n* Her favorite foods include sweet potatoes, milk, and [[anpan]].

The characters can fire guns and perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers to fight enemies across each stage. There are four weapons in the game which can be combined with one another to create different shot types.\r\n\r\nGunstar Heroes was a critical success, being praised for its frantic action and advanced graphics. It helped establish Treasure's place in the industry, and introduced several design conventions which would become characteristic of their later work such as large bosses and a unique sense of humor. \r\n\r\nIt was re-released several times, including dedicated ports to the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]], and received a sequel on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. \r\n\r\nSega released a \"Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box\" in 2006 in Japan, a compilation of Treasure games for the [[PlayStation 2]] as part of their Sega Ages 2500 series.
