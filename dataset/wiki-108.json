XXX Corps was unable to advance north from Nijmegen in the [[Battle of Nijmegen]] as quickly as planned and the British airborne troops were not relieved according to schedule. After four days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and the rest of the division trapped in a small pocket north of the river. The paratroops could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles or XXX Corps when they arrived on the southern bank, nor by Royal Air Force supply flights. After nine days of fighting, the remnants of the division were withdrawn in Operation Berlin. The Allies were unable to advance further with no secure bridges over the Nederrijn and the front line stabilised south of Arnhem.

It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]. The goal of the German offensive was to seize the harbor at Antwerp, an important Ally source of supplies, equipment and military support, so they could stop the eventual Allied advance into [[Germany]]. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern [[Belgium]] as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack and their fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. \r\n\r\nThe battle ended with an Allied [[victory]] and a significant [[defeat]] and depletion of the already exhausted German forces in fuel, armor and soldiers. From among the Americans' peak strength of 610,000 troops there were 81,000 battle casualties, including at least 8,400 killed. The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the [[United States]] in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American military history.\r\n\r\nh4.

Multiple government agencies from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] were involved in the massive search spanning four days and  over 25000 square kilometers.

All 5 people onboard, including OceanGate's CEO have been declared dead. Subsequent investigations revealed the vessel was practically doomed from the start, due to poor design and ignorance by the company's CEO, including him firing an expert for telling him his vessel was not seaworthy and previously saying things that essentially amounted to \"screw safety.\"\r\n\r\nh4.

However, due to poor production, it unexpectedly became popular online. After the 「例のアレ」meme into China, this material was discovered by【美男(BiliBili ID)】, named it【潮汕英豪传（Legend of Chaoshan Heroes）】, and tried to learn from Niconico's creative style to develop it into a subculture similar to 【Gachimuchi】or【Inm】. \r\n\r\n【潮汕英豪传】has developed for the second time since 2018. Many of the main authors are Chaoshan natives (including the organizer of Chaoshan Touhou Only), who can easily understand the video content across the dialect barrier. This helps the development of this meme has been closer to subculture rather than only be a otomad material, and can build a set of world views and stories based on the original video. Therefore, the【潮汕英豪传】 can be said to be one of the few 「例のアレ」memes from  China，Or it can be called Chinese style「例のアレ」memes\r\n\r\nThe company is located in Jieyang City, Guangdong Province, China. Most of the actors in the film use local language, this dialect is called Chaozhou dialect(潮州話/潮汕話). In Southeast Asia, British colonists often heard the language spoken by immigrant laborers from the Chaoshan region. After they transliterated this language into English, they called it Teochew dialect.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["潮汕英豪传","皇冠影视"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":167302,"created_at":"2023-06-19T23:53:55.077-04:00","updated_at":"2023-06-19T23:53:55.077-04:00","title":"koroshiya_ichi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["殺し屋1"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":167301,"created_at":"2023-06-19T21:58:14.574-04:00","updated_at":"2023-06-19T21:58:14.574-04:00","title":"wushuang_(xiao_huaxian)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["无霜"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":167300,"created_at":"2023-06-19T21:58:03.604-04:00","updated_at":"2023-06-19T21:58:03.604-04:00","title":"qingming_(xiao_huaxian)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["清明"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":4533,"created_at":"2007-01-13T14:31:09.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-06-19T21:11:26.556-04:00","title":"kneeling","body":"Resting one or both knees on the ground.
