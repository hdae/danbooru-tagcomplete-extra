Moppy originated in 2ch sales thread, and was based on the character Houki Shinonono. Without any base in the anime, this Houki parody came out to mock and laugh at other anime for selling poorer than I.S. (or as likely, going to sell poorer than I.S.) or just laugh at this and that (like sales trend or related manga/novel sales), but when she was proven wrong, then she would smilingly declared that she knew all along the other anime will do well or that she is in fact a fan all along. Now its use is so ubiquitous that you see her in book stores, game centers, video rental stores etc to make sales speech over this or that. She likes to use the words \"Moppy always know...\" モッピー知ってるよ The name Moppy came from the name Houki because in Japanese Houki means Broom, which will be Mop in its modern incarnation.[/i]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Nicopedia article (JPN): http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/モッピー\r\n* \"Google Image Search\":https://www.google.com/images?hl=en&source=hp&q=\"インフィニット・ストラトス\"|\"IS\"+モッピー&gbv=2&aq=f&oq=&aqi=&biw=1920&bih=916&sei=FeCoUJPmA-mBiQe2wIGgDA","is_locked":false,"other_names":["モッピー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":56482,"created_at":"2014-07-18T00:00:22.562-04:00","updated_at":"2014-07-18T00:00:22.562-04:00","title":"hasikko","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[hashiko_(neleven)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":21937,"created_at":"2010-08-24T23:45:47.090-04:00","updated_at":"2014-07-17T20:49:10.037-04:00","title":"medaka_box","body":"A 2009-2013 manga series by [[NisiOisiN]] of [i][[Bakemonogatari]][/i] and [i][[Katanagatari]][/i] fame, with illustrations by [[Akatsuki Akira]], serialized in Shueisha's [i][[shounen jump|Weekly Shounen Jump]][/i].

Among the folktales in which the short, demon-like humanoid called [[amanojaku_(creature)|Amanojaku]] appears, this story is the only type which is widely recounted throughout Japan.\r\n\r\nIn a basic summary of the story, a baby born from a melon is carefully raised by an old couple, and she grows up to be a beautiful young woman skilled at weaving. While her adoptive parents are away from their home, Amanojaku tricks and kidnaps her. The demon impersonates Uriko-hime, but while the impostor is going to a wealthy man's home to marry him, the fake Uriko-hime is accused by the cawing of a crow, and reveals her true identity, whereupon his true form is revealed, and the old couple and accompanying villagers beat him to death (or alternatively, he runs away).\r\n\r\nThis folktale is known for the countless variations on the story depending on the region. In southwestern Japan, her clothes are stolen and she is tied up to a tree, but in many cases she escapes unharmed and lives happily in the end. In northwestern Japan, in many versions the poor young woman is tricked to climb a persimmon tree from which she falls to her death.

An HD port for the PS3, PS4, XBox 360 and XBox One console was released in 2014.\r\n\r\nAnother World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. \r\n\r\nIt also influenced many other video game designers: Ueda Fumito cited it as an inspiration for his creation of [[Ico]] and [[Shadow of the Colossus]]. [[Hideo Kojima]], creator of [[Metal Gear (series)]], said that it was one of the five games that influenced him the most.

PuToTyra has a power that is capable of destroying or damaging Core Medals. After Eiji gains two more Purple Medals, he can access this form in the usual way or can transform straight into Putotyra while in Greeed form.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other combos, Putotyra causes most of the OOO armor to become white and cannot form a Random Combo with the other Core Medals, as the purple Medals are made in nature as the antithesis of desire, negating the power of the other Core Medals. The O Scanner announces this Combo by the call \"PuToTyrannosaurus\" instead of \"PuToTyra\".\r\n\r\nPutotyra's flight speed is faster than [[TaJaDor (OOO Combo)|TaJaDor]], has greater jumping height, and its punching and kicking powers are stronger than the other Combos, making the \"Invincible Combo\" nickname a well-deserved one.\r\n\r\nOOO can now use the wings on the Ptera Head, called External Fins, to fly, as well as to freeze the opponent with a blast of [[ice|icy]] air; the horns on the Tricera Shoulders, called the Wind Stinger, which can stretch into various lengths according to Eiji's command; and the Tyranno Legs' thigh armor can combine to form a tail, called the Tail Divider, that can give off a devastating blow.\r\n\r\nAlso, like Tajador, this Combo has its own [[weapon]], an [[axe]] called the Medagabryu that also doubles as a [[bazooka]], enabling OOO to unleash the full potential of the Purple Core Medals. The Medagabryu can draw out the full potential of the Cell Medals, by inserting a number of Cell Medals into the \"mouth\". Doing so in any Combo other than Putotyra will make it announce a Combo and a jingle remix, except for the TaJaDor Combo. When Cell Medals are inserted in the Medagabryu when in the Putotyra Combo, OOO can perform a Putotyranno Hissatsu depending on the weapon's mode. When in Axe Mode, OOO can perform the Ground of Rage or the Strain Doom when in Bazooka Mode.\r\n\r\nHis Scanning Charge is the Blasting Freezer, where OOO uses his Tricera Shoulders' Wind Stingers to stab his opponents in the shoulders to hold them in place, while he uses his Ptera Head's External Fins to freeze them immediately after, and the Tyranno Leg's Tail Divider to finish them off by smashing them into frozen shards.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["プトティラコンボ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":33909,"created_at":"2012-04-09T17:07:57.669-04:00","updated_at":"2014-07-09T17:14:20.262-04:00","title":"recorder_to_randoseru","body":"A 2007-current [[4koma]] manga by Higashiya Meme, serialized in Takeshobo's [i]Manga Club Original[/i] and [i]Manga Life Original[/i].

DragonNinja[/b] and often referred to simply as [b]Bad Dudes[/b], is a 1988 beat 'em up arcade [[video game]] developed and published by [[Data East]]. The game is notable because it deals with 2 lone street fighters facing hordes of powerful ninja and also has a memorable epic soundtrack composed by the late \"Azusa Hara\":http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Azusa_Hara, a female video game composer who did the music for several other famous Data East games. \r\n\r\nDuring the game player one controls the character named \"Blade\" in white pants and player two controls the character named \"Striker\" in green pants, who have the ability to do punches, kicks and jumps. Some moves are special like spinning kicks and the ability to charge themselves up with \"inner energy\" by holding the punch button to throw a powerful long-range attack that hits all opponents in front of the player. Most enemies can be beaten with only a single hit of any kind. Players will also come across several power-ups: some are weapons like [[sai_(weapon)|sai]] knives and [[nunchaku]]s, and some are energy drinks that recharge the player's health, or clocks that add more seconds to the remaining time.\r\n\r\nThe various types of [[ninja]] enemies encountered in the game have their own means of attack. The basic blue-colored ninja directly charge the player, while some leap with their [[katana]] swords or throw [[shuriken]]s and [[makibishi]]; there are also acrobatic kunoichi female ninja, attack dogs and even ninja who are on fire. At the end of each level, one of the \"super ninja\" bosses also appear, until the last level where they all face the players again before the final boss, the titular Dragonninja. \r\n\r\nDragonninja was followed by a 1991 spiritual successor called [b]Crude Buster[/b] (known outside of Japan as [b]Two Crude Dudes[/b]). \r\n\r\nAfter Data East became defunct due to their bankruptcy in 2003, G-Mode bought the intellectual rights to the arcade game as well as most other Data East games and licensed them globally. The arcade version is also featured, along with several other Data East arcade games, on the [[Wii]] title [i]Data East Arcade Classics[/i], produced by Majesco Entertainment with permission from G-Mode and released on February 19, 2010. \r\n\r\nh4.
