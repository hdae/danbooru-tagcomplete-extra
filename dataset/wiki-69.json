At this point, any special attack would knock Umehara's character out if connected, since special attacks deal chip damage even when blocked. In an attempt to win the round, Wong attempted to hit Umehara's Ken with Chun-Li's multihit Super Art move Houyoku-sen (鳳翼扇). \r\n\r\nHowever, instead of avoiding it, Umehara chose to \"Parry,\" a technique whereby an incoming attack is blocked without the player losing any health, but doing so requires moving toward opponent's direction in the same time a hit lands, within 10 frames of the impact animation. After the move was launched, not only were all 15 hits Parried, but Umehara also managed to counter with a punishing combo that dealt just enough damage to win the match. \r\n\r\nThis moment, and the ecstatic cheering of the spectators that followed, was recorded and later spread on the Internet, gaining immense popularity, and is often credited as one of the catalysts that popularized the competitive fighting game community.\r\n\r\nKnown in Japan as \"[b]The Desperate Comeback[/b] (背水の逆転劇)\" or \"[b]Let's go Justin[/b]\", a reference to a phrase yelled out by an unseen person in the crowd at the beginning of the full parry.

It developed in the [[medieval|Early Middle Ages]] and lasted for almost one thousand years until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars.\r\n\r\nOn 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] as Roman emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe more than three centuries after the fall of the ancient Western [[Roman Empire]] in 476. The title lapsed in 924, but was revived in 962 when [[Otto I]] was crowned emperor by Pope John XII, fashioning himself as Charlemagne's and the Carolingian Empire's successor, and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries.\r\n\r\nFrom 962 until the twelfth century, the empire was the most powerful monarchy in Europe. The functioning of government depended on the harmonious cooperation between emperor and vassals; this harmony was disturbed during the Salian period. The empire reached the apex of territorial expansion and power under the House of Hohenstaufen in the mid-thirteenth century, but overextension led to a partial collapse.\r\n\r\nWhile the office of emperor had been reestablished, the exact term for his realm as the \"Holy Roman Empire\" was not used until the 13th century. A process of Imperial Reform in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries transformed the empire, creating a set of institutions which endured until its final demise in the nineteenth century. On 6 August 1806, Emperor Francis II dissolved the empire following the creation – the month before, by [[france|French]] emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] – of the Confederation of the Rhine, a confederation of German client states loyal not to the Holy Roman emperor but to France.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["神聖ローマ帝国","HRE"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":87477,"created_at":"2017-06-22T15:50:06.592-04:00","updated_at":"2024-07-19T13:12:40.090-04:00","title":"pool_table","body":"The table used when playing [[billiards]] or snooker.

Naturally confused, but having no reasons to doubt them, the protagonist wants answers, nevertheless, the grim reapers are as confused as him about why he came to their dimension, or who is him in the first place. The only option left to get the answers he wants, is accept the help of the grim reapers and their conditions to understand who, or what he is.\r\n\r\nThe last official update of the game was released during April, 2022. Since then, no official updates for the game has been released, and the creator declared he is not satisfied with his own visual novel. And while he was willing to continue the project, he was simply not happy with the art and the direction of the game mechanics, so he was re-working on the game from zero, hoping to get better results.
