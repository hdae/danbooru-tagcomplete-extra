Both palms open and turned skyward, with arms spread open and raised slightly in a confident, 'welcoming' gesture. Arms may sometimes be  raised higher above the head. Legs usually remain standing, spread apart slightly (though some may have them close together as if standing at attention).\r\n\r\nOften accompanied with the stock exclamation of \"SUBARASHII\", hence the name. This is usually translated into English as \"magnificent\" [tn](c.f. [[Bondrewd]])[/tn], \"majestic\" [tn](c.f. [[micolash_host_of_the_nightmare|Micolash]])[/tn], \"marvelous\"  [tn](also [[Bondrewd]])[/tn], \"wonderful\", \"magnifique\", etc.\r\n\r\nMad scientists in Western works may also sometimes strike a similar pose, but this is far less common, as they tend to prefer other more intimidating poses.\r\n\r\n[expand=The Western equivalent, do not tag]The standard Western cliched equivalent generally involves one arm raised and clenched in a claw-like pose, with the other raised higher and 'pointed' towards the general direction of the viewer or another character. This second arm can be either 'open' or clenched closed, and is usually also holding another object: generally a test tube, flask, ray gun, wrench, or some other 'sciencey' implement.[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4.

Tag usage notes\r\n* Tag subarashii_pose when a character (or figurine, possibly) strikes the pose described above.\r\n* Some [[outstretched arms]] poses may look superficially similar, though generally to count the overall impression has to scream \"mad scientist\".\r\n** The best yardstick would probably be \"Am I reminded of [[Bondrewd]]?\" and \"Does this make me want to scream \"SUBARASHII?\"\r\n** If yes, then it is almost certainly the subarashii_pose.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":124815,"created_at":"2021-05-28T16:21:25.347-04:00","updated_at":"2021-06-25T07:32:26.322-04:00","title":"ohtagaki_yasuo","body":"Mangaka of [[Gundam Thunderbolt]] and [[Get Truth: Taiyou no Kiba Dougram]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":118064,"created_at":"2020-11-04T20:15:25.026-05:00","updated_at":"2021-06-25T03:59:07.415-04:00","title":"oculus_(genshin_impact)","body":"An object found in [[Genshin Impact]].\r\n\r\nA substance containing immense elemental energy.

The term (originally a numerate singular; plural [i]grawlixes[/i]) was coined by American cartoonist Mort Walker, creator of [i]Beetle Bailey[/i], in a 1964 satire for the National Cartoonists Society entitled \"Let's Get Down to Grawlixes\".  Walker later expanded on the theme in a 1980 book, [i]The Lexicon of Comicana[/i], in which he coined \"technical\" terms for other common visual shorthands, such as [i]plewds[/i] ([[flying sweatdrops]]) and [i]emanata[/i] ([[^^^]]).","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":8878,"created_at":"2008-10-28T14:46:48.292-04:00","updated_at":"2021-06-17T15:54:50.136-04:00","title":"anaglyph","body":"Anaglyph images are used to provide a stereoscopic 3D effect, when viewed with 2 color glasses (each lens a chromatically opposite color, usually red and cyan). Images are made up of two color layers, superimposed, but offset with respect to each other to produce a depth effect. Usually the main subject is in the center, while the foreground and background are shifted laterally in opposite directions. The picture contains two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the \"color coded\" \"3D glasses\", they reveal an integrated stereoscopic image. The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into perception of a three dimensional scene or composition.\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with the much more common [[chromatic aberration]], which is visually similar to [[anaglyph]], but is not intended to create a stereoscopic image.  [[Chromatic aberration]] typically offsets color layers of the entire image uniformly, whereas true [[anaglyph]] offsets foreground and background differently to create the 3D effect.  In real life photography, [[chromatic aberration]] is naturally caused by lens problems.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[chromatic aberration]]\r\n* \"Wikipedia article\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D]\r\n* [[3D Glasses]]\r\n* [[Stereogram]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アナグリフ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":125422,"created_at":"2021-06-17T11:49:18.019-04:00","updated_at":"2021-06-17T11:49:18.019-04:00","title":"amabie_(yu-gi-oh!)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["あまびえさん"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":125404,"created_at":"2021-06-16T13:58:28.696-04:00","updated_at":"2021-06-17T05:42:01.745-04:00","title":"hi_ye","body":"Taiwanese artist.

The M100/M110 series are fire .22 Long Rifle rounds, while the M750/M900/M950/M960 series fire 9x19mm. The 9x19mm versions were later renamed the Calico Liberty I, II, and III. All versions use proprietary helical box magazines with a capacity of 50 or 100 rounds mounted on top, and shell casings are ejected out the bottom similar to the [[P90]].\r\n\r\nWhile civilian semi-automatic sales have been limited and attempt to market the submachine guns to military and law enforcement have been unsuccessful, the Calico series are somewhat popular in science fiction due to their futuristic appearance.\r\n\r\nh4.

It appears similar to an fighter plane body with 4 legs instead of wings and a large [[cannon]] mounted on top with its ammunition magazine hanging in the back. In series it is described as looking like a prowling spider.\r\n\r\nThe M1A4 Juggernaut is labelled as a military \"drone\" by the Republic of San Magnolia, though it is actually a piloted Feldreß (multi-legged armored-weapon system).  Given the official labelling as a drone, the armor and life-preserving equipment were either minimal or not present in the design.  The cockpit was enclosed by a clam-shell armored canopy, but as this prevented the pilot from seeing out they would have to depend on viewscreens for sight.  These viewscreens were of low resolution though, and so resulted in poor visibility for pilots.  The joint connecting the armored canopy was also not particularly durable, so a strong impact could dislodge the canopy from the Juggernaut.  Given the design of the cockpit this would also result in the canopy decapitating the pilot, and as such the canopy was also referred to as \"the guillotine.\"  Due to poor quality control in their manufacturing the canopy would not form a complete seal over the cockpit, thus leaving the pilot exposed to the environment outside. \r\n\r\nh6.
