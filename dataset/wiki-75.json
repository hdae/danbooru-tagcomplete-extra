This plus the black neck, white streak leading from the red crown partially down the neck, and white body make them easy to identify. This crane is one of the largest crane species.\r\n\r\nOverall, they are snow white with black secondary flight feathers (in flight, these are the row of largest feathers present on the \"lower arm\" of the wing). This can appear like a fluffy black tail when the birds are standing, but the real tail feathers as well as the primary flight feathers are actually white. The bill is olive green to greenish horn, the legs are slate to grayish black.\r\n\r\nMales are black on the cheeks, throat, and neck, while females are pearly gray in these spots. \r\n\r\nSome artistic renditions may show a black tail or black primary flight feathers if the artist did not reference a photo or accurate illustration of the bird in flight. Regardless, if the crane has a red forehead or a line delineating this marking, it is almost certainly a red-crowned crane.\r\n\r\nIn Taoism this crane is a symbol of longevity and immortality. It also symbolizes luck and fidelity.\r\n\r\nh4.

The series consists of 4 TV seasons with a theatrical film set at the midpoint, as well as two companion comic runs by [[Marvel]] - one produced in the US, and the other in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe G1 TV cartoon is notable because it was made in an 80s [[mecha]] anime style. The [[box art]] for the [[toy]]s based on the cartoon was made by [[Jeffrey Mangiat]]. For art done in his style see [[Jeffrey Mangiat (style)]]. The [[Marvel]] [[comic]]s company also contributed to the original franchise by developing the whole fictional Generation 1 universe of the TV series and its robot characters info and backgrounds, all created by Marvel comics writer \"Bob Budiansky\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Budiansky. \r\n\r\nThe [b]Transformers: Generation 1[/b] tag is for the original series and supplementary media only.
