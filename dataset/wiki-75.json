Test Able consisted of a [[nuclear weapon|Mark III]] [[bomb]] dropped from a [[B-29 Superfortress]], while Test Baker consisted of a Mark III bomb detonated underwater.

The Japanese Army designation was \"[b]Army Type 3 Fighter[/b]\" (三式戦闘機). Its Allied reporting name was [b]Tony[/b] and the only mass-produced Japanese fighter of the war to use a liquid-cooled inline V engine. The inline engines used were derivatives of the Daimler-Benz DB series (the Ki-61-I variants used the Ha-40, the Japanese version of the DB 601 engine while the Ki-61-II variants used the Ha-140, the Japanese equivalent of the DB 605 engine) and were generally unreliable due to the Japanese Army having lack of experience with inline engines.\r\n\r\nInitially armed with two 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns in the fuselage and two 7.7 x 58 mm SR Type 89 machine guns in the wings, it was upgraded to four 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns (the wing machine guns being replaced), two 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns in the fuselage and two MG 151/20 cannons (20 x 82 mm) in the wings and finally to two 20 x 94 mm Ho-5 cannons in the fuselage and two 12.7 x 81 mm Ho-103 machine guns in the wings (the wing machine guns were sometimes removed).\r\n\r\nIt was designed by Doi Takeo [土井 武夫] and entered combat for first time in early 1943.\r\n\r\nh4.

Nicknamed \"The Strongest Spellcaster, with the Appearance of a Skeleton\" due to the aforementioned reasons.\r\n\r\nAinz also sometimes plays the role of \"[[Momon (overlord)|]]\", a black knight who fights with two huge swords, often with the purpose of collecting new information by doing undercover missions. Helping him in this endeavor is [[Narberal Gamma]], assuming the name \"Nabe\" and pretending to be his colleague, rather than servant.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アインズ・ウール・ゴウン","アインズ様","モモンガ(オーバーロード)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184161,"created_at":"2024-02-09T08:18:14.767-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-09T08:18:14.767-05:00","title":"kotsubako","body":"An ornamental [[box]] meant to hold a funerary urn.

Both the arcade system and console were very very powerful for the time and the AES allowed for perfect ports of 2D games released for the arcade MVS with superior colors and sound. \r\n\r\nHowever, the equally very very high price point for both the console and its games prevented it from directly competing with its contemporaries, the [[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[super_nintendo|Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].\r\n\r\nYears later, SNK would release the Neo Geo CD, a more cost effective console with games released on compact discs. The console was met with limited success, due in part to its slow CD-ROM drive. \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to compete with increasingly popular 3D games, SNK released the Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade system in 1997 as the successor to its aging MVS. The system did not fare well and only a few titles were released for it. A planned home console based on the hardware was never released. \r\n\r\nSNK later extended the brand by releasing two handheld consoles, the Neo Geo Pocket and Neo Geo Pocket Color, which briefly competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. Soon after their release, SNK encountered various legal and financial issues and the Neo Geo brand was officially discontinued in 2004.\r\n\r\nDespite the failure of later Neo Geo hardware, games for the original MVS and AES were very well received. The system spawned several long-running series, including [[The King of Fighters]] and [[Samurai Spirits|Samurai Shodown]]. Later releases like the [[Metal Slug]] games ensured that the hardware had quite a long lifespan. \r\n\r\nHomebrew video games for the system have also been released and the AES system along with its games are popular among collectors, with many AES items still fetching high prices at auction.

Situated in the camargue region of southern France, it is located on the coast of the Gulf of Lion, part of the Mediterranean Sea, near the mouth of the Rhône river. Its inhabitants are called Marseillais.\r\n\r\nMarseille is the second most populous city in France, with 870,731 inhabitants in 2019 (Jan. census) over a municipal territory of 241 km2 (93 sq mi). Together with its suburbs and exurbs, the Marseille metropolitan area, which extends over 3,972 km2 (1,534 sq mi), had a population of 1,873,270 at the Jan. 2019 census, the third most populated in France after those of Paris and Lyon. The cities of Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, and 90 suburban municipalities have formed since 2016 the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis, an indirectly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of wider metropolitan issues, with a population of 1,898,561 at the Jan. 2019 census.\r\n\r\nFounded around 600 BC by Greek settlers from Phocaea, Marseille is the oldest city in [[France]], as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements. It was known to the ancient Greeks as Massalia and to Romans as Massilia. Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the Old Port still lies at the heart of the city where the manufacturing of soap, its famous savon de Marseille, began some 6 centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde or \"Bonne-mère\" for the people of Marseille, a Romano-Byzantine church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port. Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a cosmopolitan city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after [[London]] and [[Paris]].\r\n\r\nh4. Landmarks\r\n* [[Notre Dame de la Garde]]\r\n* [[Vieux-Port de Marseille]]\r\n\r\nh4.

It uses restricted [b]HTML[/b] formatting in contrast to most of Danbooru, which uses [b]DText[/b] formatting.\r\n\r\nh4#basic.Basic markup\r\n\r\nThis section describes the most common and easy to use tags.\r\n\r\n* [code]<b>[/code] - Bolds text ([b]example[/b]).\r\n* [code]<i>[/code] - Italicizes text ([i]example[/i]).\r\n* [code]<s>[/code] - Strikes out text ([s]Example[/s]).\r\n* [code]<u>[/code] - Underlines text ([u]Example[/u]).\r\n* [code]<big>[/code] - Increases the font size of text. \r\n* [code]<small>[/code] - Decreases the font size of text. \r\n* To display an actual \"<\" or \">\" character, use the following:\r\n** [code]&lt;[/code] - \"<\", i.e. less than.\r\n** [code]&gt;[/code] - \">\", i.e. greater than.\r\n* [code]<tn>[/code] - A Danbooru-specific tag for translator's notes, i.e. clarifying remarks on the actual translation. It adds a line break and makes enclosed text small and gray. \r\n** For purposes of consistency, all translator's notes should use this tag, and do not need to be indicated with 'TL:', 'N.B.', or any other such identifier.\r\n** The [code]<tn>[/code] tag should [i]not[/i] be used for other purposes, such as sound effects - consider using italics for that.\r\n\r\nh4#intermediate. Intermediate markup\r\n\r\nThis section deals with more complex markup, allowing to include hyper-links, align text, and separate text.\r\n\r\nh5#attributes. Attributes\r\n\r\nHTML tags can be assigned attributes to achieve various effects. Attributes always take the format of [code]attribute=\"attribute text\"[/code] .\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div something=\"foobar\"></div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh5. Hyper-links\r\n\r\nThese use the [code]<a></code> tag. They can be used to link to any internal/external webpages.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nThe link is assigned using the [code]href[/code] attribute, and the link text goes inbetween the enclosing [code]<a>[/code] tags.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<a href=\"https://www.example.com\">Link text</a>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nPages that are internal to Danbooru can use relative links, i.e. the URL without the domain attached.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<a href=\"/posts/1234\">Link to post #1234</a>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nElements on the same page can be linked to using anchor links, which are hashtags \"#\" followed by the ID of the element being linked to.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<a href=\"#artist-comment\">Link to the artist commentary</a>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. FONT tag\r\n\r\nThis is the [code]<font>[/code] tag. [b]DO NOT USE THIS TAG![/b] It has been deprecated in HTML5, and will cause all stylings set with it to no longer function when Danbooru converts to using it. See [[About:Note Fonts]] for information on changing the font instead.\r\n\r\nh5. SPAN tag\r\n\r\nThis is the [code]<span>[/code] tag. It is a basic inline tag.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nUse it to encapsulate text that should go on the same line as text before and/or after it.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nThis is <span>some basic</span> inline text.\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. DIV tag\r\n\r\nThis is the [code]<div>[/code] tag. It is a basic block tag. \r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nUse it to encapsulate text that are on separate lines.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div>Block line 1</div><div>Block line 2</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nBoth of the above will go on separate lines.\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. P tag\r\n\r\nThis is the [code]<p>[/code] tag. It is a basic block tag.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt has a few key differences from the [code]<div>[/code] tag.\r\n\r\n* 1. It adds an extra line-break if it is not the last HTML tag in note.\r\n* 2. It cannot be used to encapsulate other block tags like [code]<div>[/code] or another [code]<p>[/code] .\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5#tn-tag. TN tag\r\n\r\nThis is the [code]<tn>[/code] tag. It is used to specifiy text for translation notes.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nAs \"mentioned above\":[#dtext-basic], its use is internal to Danbooru only.\r\n\r\nUnder the covers, it is in actuality the [code]<p>[/code] tag. So the following:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<tn>Translation text.</tn>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n...becomes the following:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<p class=\"tn\">Translation text.</p>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nAs shown above, the size and color the the translator text is added by using the [code]class[/code] attribute set with the value \"tn\". The same can be done with any other HTML tag. This is useful if one doesn't want to have a line-break added, like a translation note at the top of the HTML.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div class=\"tn\">[Background text]</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#align. Align attribute\r\n\r\nThe [code]align[/code] attribute allows one to specify the text alignment of the encapsulated text.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\n* [code]center[/code] - Center aligned text.\r\n* [code]left[/code] - Left aligned text.\r\n* [code]right[/code] - Right aligned text.\r\n* [code]justify[/code] - Text is spaced to fill the entire block.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div align=\"center\">Text that is center aligned.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Only the [code]<div>[/code] and [code]<p>[/code] tags accept the [code]align[/code] attribute.\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4#advanced. Advanced markup\r\n\r\nThe following section deals with even more complex markup, which can be used to further style the text in the notes.\r\n\r\nh5. Class attribute\r\n\r\nThis attribute can be used to add preprogrammed styles to a note. \r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nOne example was shown above with \"translator notes\":[#dtext-tn-tag]. Multiple classes can be used with this attribute. Each class must be separated by a space.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<span class=\"tn mb-4\">Translator text with a margin bottom of 16px.</span>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nOther available classes can be found looking through Danbooru's style sheets.\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. Style attribute\r\n\r\nThis attribute is how most stylings should be applied to notes. \r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nThis attribute can have one or more CSS properties added. Each property ends with a colon \":\" with the value of that property ending in a semi-colon \";\" .\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: red;\">Text that is 18 pixels and red.</span>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#color. Color property\r\n\r\nThe [code]color[/code] property specifies the color of the text.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt takes the following values.\r\n\r\n* Color name, e.g. [code]red[/code].\r\n* RGB hexadecimal value, e.g. [code]#444[/code] or [code]#123456[/code].\r\n** 3-digit hex codes mirror the first digit onto the second, e.g. #123 is actually #112233.\r\n* RGB function, e.g. [code]rgb(255, 42, 22)[/code]\r\n** Values are decimal format.\r\n* HSL function, e.g. [code]hsl(120, 100%, 50%)[/code]\r\n** Hue is 0 to 360, saturation and lightness are 0 to 100%\r\n\r\nAlpha transparency can also be added by adding an extra 2 digits to the hex format or using the RGBA/HSLA functions. The values are 00-FF for hex, and 0.0 to 1.0 for RGBA/HSLA.\r\n\r\n* The codes [code]#000fdbA1[/code], [code]rgba(0, 15, 219, 0.63/63%)[/code] and [code]hsla(236, 100%, 43%, 0.63/63%)[/code] all correspond to the same color with 63% transparency level.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<span style=\"color: red;\">Text that is red.</span>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#font-size. Font size property\r\n\r\nThe [code]font-size[/code] property specifies the size of the text.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt takes the following values.\r\n\r\n* [b]Absolute size[/b]\r\n** Zero, e.g. [code]0[/code]\r\n** Pixels, e.g. [code]18px[/code].\r\n** Centimeters, e.g. [code]0.5cm[/code]\r\n** Millimeters, e.g. [code]50mm[/code]\r\n** Inches, e.g. [code]0.25in[/code]\r\n** Names, e.g. [code]large[/code].\r\n*** Available names: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large\r\n* [b]Relative sizes[/b]\r\n** Percentage, e.g. [code]%100[/code].\r\n*** Relative the the parent element's [code]font-size[/code].\r\n** EM (element multiply), e.g. [code]3em[/code].\r\n*** Relative the the parent element's [code]font-size[/code], so 3em is 3x the  parent's font-size.\r\n** REM (root element multiply), e.g. [code]3rem[/code].\r\n*** Relative the the root element's [code]font-size[/code] (usually 16px), so 3em is 3 x 16px or 48px.\r\n* Names, e.g. [code]larger[/code].\r\n** Available names: smaller, larger\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Text that is 18 pixels.</span>\r\n[/code]\r\nTip: Use relative sizes whenever possible. Doing so makes notes more likely to display correctly when viewed on differently sized displays.\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#background-color. Background color property\r\n\r\nThe [code]background-color[/code] property specifies the color of the area contained by the element and its padding.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt takes the same values as the \"color property\":[#dtext-color]. The amount of area filled depends on the \"size\":[#dtext-size] and \"padding\":[#dtext-padding] of the HTML element, as well as whether the HTML element is an inline or block tag.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Background color is yellow.</span>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#background. Background\r\n\r\nThe [code]background[/code] property is the shorthand property that also allow you repeating patterns and gradient backgrounds.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nFor gradient backgrounds, it works like [code]background-image[/code] from CSS (it doesn't work if you change it to [code]background-image[/code]).\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, blue);\">That text has a left to right red-blue gradient background.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#text-align. Text align\r\n\r\nThe [code]text-align[/code] property specifies the alignment in the encapsulated text.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt takes the same values as the \"align attribute\":[#dtext-align].\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Text that is center aligned.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#padding. Padding\r\n\r\nThe [code]padding[/code] property specifies the area between the element and the border if there is one.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\n can take the same values as the \"font-size property\":[#dtext-font-size]. The EM and % values are relative to the element's [code]font-size[/code]. The number of values specified determines which sides get which value.\r\n\r\n* 1 value, e.g. [code]padding: 18px[/code]\r\n** All 4 sides get the value of 18px\r\n* 2 values, e.g. [code]padding: 18px 0[/code]\r\n** Top and bottom are 18px, left and right are 0\r\n* 3 values, e.g. [code]padding: 18px 0 24px[/code]\r\n** Top is 18px, left and right are 0, bottom is 24px\r\n* 4 values, e.g. [code]padding: 18px 0 24px 5px[/code]\r\n** Top is 18px, right is 0, bottom is 24px, left is 5px\r\n\r\nInstead of using [code]padding[/code], individual sides can be specified by using [code]padding-top[/code], [code]padding-bottom[/code], [code]padding-left[/code], or [code]padding-right[/code].\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Top and bottom padding do not work with inline elements such as [code]<span>[/code] .\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#margin. Margin\r\n\r\nThe [code]margin[/code] property specifies the area between the border (if there is one) and the surrounding elements.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt follows the same values and format as the \"padding property\":[#dtext-padding].  Unlike with padding, margin values can be negative, e.g. \"-24px\". This effectively pulls it closer to other elements, to the point where it can overlap.\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Top and bottom margins do not work with inline elements such as [code]<span>[/code] .\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#text-shadow. Text-shadow\r\n\r\nThe [code]text-shadow[/code] property allows one to add shadows to an element's text.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt uses values from both the \"color property\":[#dtext-color] and the \"font-size property\":[#dtext-font-size]. It specifies the position, bluriness, and color of text which will shadow the encapsulating text. Multiple shadows can be specified by separating each value by a comma \",\".\r\n\r\n* [b]Format:[/b] [code]x-position y-position blur-radius color[/code]\r\n** x-position (required, size parameter)\r\n** y-position (required, size parameter)\r\n** blur-radius (optional, size parameter)\r\n*** Defaults to 0 when not specified.\r\n** color (optiona, color parameter)\r\n*** Defaults to the element's color when not specified.\r\n\r\nIf only the [code]blur-radius[/code] or [code]color[/code] is specified, it will interpret the value based upon whether it is a size or color value. If it is a size value, it will be the [b]blur-radius[/b], if it is a color value, it will be the [code]color[/code].\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px, -5px -5px red;\">Text with 2 shadows with different colors, position, and bluriness.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#white-space. White-space\r\n\r\nThe [code]white-space[/code] property allows one to control how whitespace and text wrapping are handled.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nThis property controls whether two different kinds of character substitutions are made:\r\n* If multiple whitespace characters appear consecutively, they can be replaced with a single character, causing sequences of spaces to be replaced with a single space. This also removes leading or trailing whitespace from a line.\r\n* If a line of text is determined to be too long to fit inside the note's current width, automatic text wrapping can be performed by replacing a whitespace character with a line break.\r\n\r\nThe possible values of this property are as follows:\r\n* [code]normal[/code] - Collapse sequences of whitespace and wrap text when necessary. This is the default\r\n* [code]nowrap[/code] - Collapse sequences of whitespace, wrap text only at line breaks.\r\n* [code]pre[/code] - Whitespace is preserved, wrap text only at line breaks.\r\n* [code]pre-line[/code] - Same as [code]normal[/code](?)\r\n* [code]pre-wrap[/code] - Whitespace is preserved, wrap text when necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen using [code]nowrap[/code] or [code]pre[/code], the note box will resize to fit the longer line.\r\n\r\nWhen suppressing text wrapping, keep in mind your notes should be accessible to users on all platforms. Mobile users have dramatically less screen width than PC users, and notes that are too wide may go off both sides of the screen.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to this property, you might consider using a non-breaking space by entering [code]&nbsp;[/code]. As its name implies, a non-breaking space prevents text wrapping from occurring where it is used, forcing the words before and after it to be on the same line. It otherwise is visually identical to an ordinary space.\r\n\r\n[b]Examples:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"white-space: nowrap\">This is a really long line of text which doesn't contain any line breaks. When used in a note, the nowrap value prevents it from wrapping to a new line no matter what, even if the note ends up going off the screen.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"white-space: normal\">  ▲\r\n▲ ▲</div>\r\n<div style=\"white-space: pre\">  ▲\r\n▲ ▲</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh6#transform. Transform\r\n\r\nThe [code]transform[/code] property allows one to change the size and orientation of an element.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt can use the following functions.\r\n\r\n* [b]Size parameter transforms[/b]\r\n** These transforms use the \"font-size\":[#dtext-font-size] values.\r\n** [code]translate(x, y)[/code] - Translates (moves) the element.\r\n*** [code]translateX[/code] and [code]translateY[/code] functions are also available which only affects the specified axis.\r\n** [code]scale(x, y)[/code] - Scales (resizes) the element. Uses scalar values, e.g. \"3.0\" is 3 times the current size.\r\n*** [code]scaleX[/code] and [code]scaleY[/code] functions are also available which only affects the specified axis.\r\n* [b]Angle parameter transforms[/b]\r\n** These transforms use \"deg\" for degrees, \"rad\" for radians, and \"turn\" which is equivalent to 360 degrees.\r\n*** E.g. \"30deg\", \"1.25rad\", \"0.5turn\"\r\n** [code]rotate(angle)[/code] - Rotates the element.\r\n** [code]skew(x-angle, y-angle)[/code] - Rotates the element.\r\n*** [code]skewX[/code] and [code]skewY[/code] functions are also available which only affects the specified axis.\r\n\r\nMultiple transforms are stackable by separating each transform by a space.\r\n\r\n[b]Examples:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"transform: scale(2, 1) translate(2em, 0) rotate(30deg);\">Scales the X axis by 2, moves it to the right by 2em, and rotates it 30 degrees.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. Position\r\n\r\nPrecise positioning of text can be achieved by using the [code]position[/code] property. \r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nFirst set the parent element with [code]position:relative[/code], as well as setting the height and width. Then set the sub-elements with [code]position:absolute[/code] , then use left / right and top / bottom to place the sub-element text relative to the parent element.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div style=\"position: relative; width: 6.5em; height: 2.5em;\">\r\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 4em; top: 0;\">Chirp</div>\r\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 4em; top: 1em;\">Chirp</div>\r\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 1.75em;; top: 0.25em;\">Chirp</div>\r\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 0; top: 1em;\">Chirp</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Since the sub-elements are using absolute positions, the whitespace between the sub-elements no longer matters.\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. Title attribute\r\n\r\nThe [code]title[/code] attribute can be used to add popup text to any element, which will appear when the user hovers over it with the pointer.\r\n\r\n[expand=Example]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div title=\"This is some popup text.\">The main text.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh5. RUBY tag\r\n\r\nThis is the [code]<ruby>[/code] tag. It is an inline tag, and allows one to place smaller pronounciation/explanatory text over other text, much like how Furigana can go over Kanji.\r\n\r\n[expand=Details]\r\n\r\nIt works in concert with the [code]<rb>[/code] and [code]<rt>[/code] tags.\r\n\r\nInside the [code]<ruby>[/code] element goes pairs of [code]<rb>[/code] and [code]<rt>[/code] elements. The [code]<rb>[/code] specifies the bottom text, and the [code]<rt>[/code] specifies the top text. Order matters, and so the [code]<rb>[/code] element must always go before the [code]<rt>[/code] element.\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<ruby><rb>誕</rb><rt>tan</rt><rb>生</rb><rt>jou</rt><rb>日</rb><rt>bi</rt></ruby>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4#useful.
