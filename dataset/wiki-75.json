Director Steven Spielberg helmed the 1993 film adaptation, and several actors were considered for the role of Grant. It ultimately went to Sam Neill, becoming one of his most popular roles. Spielberg gave the character a dislike of children, and put him in a relationship with [[Ellie_Sattler_(jurassic_park)|Dr. Ellie Sattler]], a paleobotanist who is Grant's student in the novel.
