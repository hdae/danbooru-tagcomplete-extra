She has a well-trained and toned body and boasts Q-cup boobs.\r\n\r\nShe is a beautiful girl with a fine nose and eyes with a dignified atmosphere, which attracts the eyes of those around her. And she is also the head maid of the fellow maid group. As a Valkyrie, she should be strong in battle and in rough times, a dependable leader... But that is not the case at all. In fact, she is one of the most clumsy underachievers in the school, and her motivation and abilities are out of all proportion.\r\n\r\nShe is serious and straightforward, proud of her race, and has a strong sense of justice. Although she may sound like an excellent student, she is in fact a stupid girl, a waste-of-space Valkyrie that even her mother and teachers have a hard time wrapping their heads around. Basically, she is a girl who fails everything except subjects related to combat and physical education, and is a regular recipient of red marks. Moreover, she was happy for a while, thinking that a red mark was \"a good mark\". In addition, contrary to her appearance, she is sensitive to being dominated, and is aroused easily by anything. She sometimes orgasms in reaction to sneezing, and the protagonist compares her to an old man's urine leakage. Although she has many problems, she has a strong sense of camaraderie and is willing to put herself on the line to protect her friends, so she is well trusted by those around her. She is often teased by others, but often does not even realize she is being teased, which is a pity.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \"Maid Hunting Club\". The maids of Yggdrasil fight monsters to protect their masters, so the hunting club has a large presence in the school. Kriemhild, who is not very good at classroom learning but is at the top of her class when it comes to combat, is the captain of the club as well.\r\n\r\nHer mother, Brynhildr, is also a Valkyrie, and is the captain of the Valkyrie unit which also includes the head of the school's security force. Kriemhild respects her mother more than anyone else, and they get along well, but her daughter's lack of ability makes her give up on her. However, she is trying to put her body on the line in the hope that the long-awaited master from another world will do something about it (in more ways than one).","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クリムヒルデ・ヴァルハンナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":128051,"created_at":"2021-09-15T17:49:34.900-04:00","updated_at":"2022-11-19T13:24:03.897-05:00","title":"flight_highschool","body":"A manga series by [[anyan_(jooho)]] about personifications of military aircraft.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["비행고등학교","飛行高校"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":153345,"created_at":"2022-11-19T13:16:50.090-05:00","updated_at":"2022-11-19T13:16:50.090-05:00","title":"mugetsu_form_(bleach)","body":"By using this technique, Ichigo becomes Getsuga (月牙, Moon Fang) itself.

It is basically flavorless, and is usually an ingredient in more complex foods rather than eaten straight. It is frequently used as a vegan substitute for [[gelatin]]. Unlike gelatin, however, konnyaku can be a choking hazard if not properly chewed.\r\n\r\nKonnyaku is used in making [[oden]], [[lychee]] cups and konjac candy, a thick Jello-like snack made with fruit paste to flavor the konnyaku. Konnyaku can also be pressed through a mesh to create gelatinous noodles called [i]shirataki[/i], often used in Japanese soups like [i][[sukiyaki]][/i] or [i][[gyuudon]][/i].  \r\n\r\nKonnyaku is low in calories and high in fiber, so it is frequently used as diet food.\r\n\r\nh4.

In America, it is standard for the first number to be 20 (feet), with 20/20 being normal vision.
