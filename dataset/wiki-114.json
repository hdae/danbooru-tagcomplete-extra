When the tournament is over, she realizes that she is late for camp and attempts to sneak back in as if nothing had happened. However, she is caught by one of the camp's instructors.\r\n\r\nLater in 2nd Impact, Ibuki was sent by her clan to procure documents from [[Gill (street fighter)|]]'s organization. These documents concerned the \"G-File\" project, which was responsible for creating Necro and Twelve. Gill voluntarily gave Ibuki the documents, though the project was already under way by that point.\r\n\r\nIn [[street fighter iii (series)|3rd Strike]], Ibuki tracks down [[Oro (street fighter)|]] to fight him for her ninja graduation exam. She fights well enough to pass, and moves on to go to a university.

The main difference is that favgroups are owned by a single user and that user is the only one who can add or remove posts from it.\r\n\r\nh4. Viewing your favorite groups\r\n\r\nYour favorite groups are listed under \"Fav groups\" in the menu on the main \"/posts\":/posts page, and under Statistics in your user profile.\r\n\r\nYou can search for favorite groups using the {{favgroup:<name>}} or {{favgroup:<id number>}} metatags (see [[help:cheatsheet]]).\r\n\r\nh4.

You can use [[help:tag scripts|tag scripting]] to quickly add posts to a favgroup in bulk.\r\n\r\nh4. Removing a post from a favorite group\r\n\r\nTag the post with {{-favgroup:<name>}}.
