A clover clamp is not limited to clamping nipples, although this is the most commonly drawn use in art.\r\n\r\nNote: tag uses the singular \"clamp\" instead of plural form \"clamps\", since using a single clamp is seen frequently as well. Single clamps are typically for more extreme predicament and [[humiliation]] than for nipple play in [[BDSM]].\r\n\r\n(Full entry below includes text originally adapted from Wikipedia. Providing this note for reference to borrowed definition text from the article \"Nipple clamp, under the 'Clover clamp' section\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple_clamp#Clover_clamp])\r\n\r\nThe clover clamp, also referred to as \"butterfly clamp\" or \"bird clamp\" is of Japanese origin and was designed for clamping sails or sewing fabric. The clamp is flat, about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide, and has an eyelet to which a chain or cord can be attached. If this is pulled a mechanism inside the clamp moves the jaws closer together and provides increasing tension. When they are applied to the nipples a spring hinge holds them in place under tension and provides a very high pain level.They are used for [[nipple torture]] in the BDSM community.\r\n\r\nTo increase the tension on the nipples, small weights are sometimes attached to the clamps or the chain. These can be weights designed specifically for this purpose or weights such as fishing sinkers can be used.\r\n\r\nAnother use for the clamps is to keep a person in one place. If a cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move.\r\n\r\nThis technique can be used for [[predicament bondage]]. The removal of the clamps is also painful and different methods of removal can increase or decrease this pain.\r\n\r\nThese clamps have small points of contact and hence their pinch is usually painful, especially on people with larger nipples. They are usually only used by more experienced users for the purposes of [[edging]], [[orgasm denial]] or [[nipple torture]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["butterfly_clamp","Japanese_clamp","bird_clamp"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129999,"created_at":"2021-11-05T00:12:34.960-04:00","updated_at":"2023-06-05T07:33:19.496-04:00","title":"ishikawa_ken","body":"Ken Ishikawa (石川賢, Ishikawa Ken, June 28, 1948 – November 15, 2006) was a Japanese manga artist.

It is often accompanied by [[picnic|picnicking]], drinking, and other activities. \r\n\r\nThe appeal of viewing tree blossoms itself is found in the very brief period of flowering, which lasts seldom over a week before the petals have all fallen, and the leaves of their trees begin to sprout. This is considered a symbolic motif representing the beauty and impermanence of life. Owing to the cultural significance of the practice, Japan's national weather service keeps an annual forecast to inform the public as to when cherry trees are predicted to blossom. \r\n\r\nViewing plum blossoms (ume) is an older practice which started in the Nara period, and was eclipsed during the Heian period by the popularity of viewing cherry blossoms. Many older Japanese today prefer ume viewing (sometimes known as 梅見, [i]umemi[/i]), as they find that sakura viewing parties may be too crowded and raucous. \r\n\r\nh4.

The series serves as a spiritual successor to the [[Mega Man Zero (series)|]] series.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in a distant future where those born with psychic powers known as \"Adapts\" (EN) / \"Seventh\" (JP) are feared and oppressed on a regular basis by those without. A major world-wide conglomerate known as the Sumuragi Group tasked themselves into bringing peace to Adapts under their \"Psychic Protection\" program, but unbeknownst to the world, their so-called plan for peace turned out to be what amounts to concentration camps where a series of cruel and inhumane experiments are performed on Adapts under their program. A resistance group known as QUILL (EN) / FEATHER (JP) however surfaced in attempt to stop their atrocities. One of their newest members, a 14-year-old Adapt boy known only by his codename, \"[[Gunvolt]]\", who also possesses the titular \"Azure Striker\" (EN) / \"Armed Blue\" (JP) septima, the ability to control electricity and lightning. During one mission where Gunvolt is tasked to stop Sumuragi's plans to steal the cyber diva [[lumen_(gunvolt)|Lumen]] (EN) / Morpho (JP) and her septima of \"The Muse\" to control Adapts across the world then destroy her, Gunvolt however he discovers that the cyber diva was not a computer programmed idol, but rather the manifestation of a young girl's septimal powers named [[joule_(gunvolt)|Joule]] (EN) / Cyan (JP). Not wishing to see Joule suffer through the same kind of oppression he went through, Gunvolt boldly went against his orders and rescues her from her captors.\r\n\r\nThe series later gained a sequel, [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt 2[/i], which takes place a few months after the events of its predecessor, where Gunvolt crosses paths with an Adapt-hunting avenger named [[acura_(gunvolt)|Copen]] (EN) / Acura (JP) from the previous game as they encounter a group of Adapts known as Eden, whom harbor a hatred towards humans, seeking to use Joule's powers to wipe out humans and create a new utopia for Adapts. A gaiden game, [i][[gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix|Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX]][/i], later follows after the events of [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt 1[/i] and focuses on Copen. There are also supplementary materials that expands on the serie's world and characters, such as [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt: Fleeting Memories[/i], prequel story taking place before the first game, as well as an OVA based on the first game released through the Nintendo 3DS eShop. Gunvolt also made an appearance in [i][[Mighty Gunvolt]][/i], a retro-inspired spin-off series of games also from Inti Creates that features a cross-over of [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt[/i], [i][[Mighty No. 9]][/i], and [i][[gal_gun|Gal☆Gun]][/i]. The series gains a third game in [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt 3[/i], set years after the events of [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt 2[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.Characters\r\nh5.
