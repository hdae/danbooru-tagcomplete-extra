The characters are mostly from Fate/Zero, with a few appearances from Fate/Stay Night characters. \r\n\r\nThis is a story about 212cm military otaku with \"Sensha Otoko\" as his handle name, who despite his huge, imposing appearance, is actually very shy, and thus no girlfriends. One day, he saves a teenage girl from being harassed, and falls in love. However, because he has no experience in romance, he consults his [[otaku]] friends on the web-board Eirei Throne-Channel for advice. This is the beginning of a True Tank Story.\r\n\r\nh4.

She famously relates to the tale of the missing sun deity, Amaterasu Omikami. Her name can also be pronounced as Ama-no-Uzume.[1][2]\r\n\r\nAmaterasu's brother, the storm god Susano'o, had vandalized her rice fields, threw a flayed horse at her loom, and brutally killed one of her maidens due to a quarrel between them. In turn, Amaterasu became furious with him and retreated into the Heavenly Rock Cave, Amano-Iwato. The world, without the illumination of the sun, became dark and the gods could not lure Amaterasu out of her hiding place.\r\n\r\nThe clever Uzume overturned a tub near the cave entrance and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other deities. They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight.[3] This dance is said to have founded the Japanese ritual dance, Kagura. [4]\r\n\r\nAmaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what all the fuss was about. When she opened the cave, she saw her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly emerged from her hiding spot.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo-no-mikoto dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat. Another god tied a magic shimenawa across the entrance.[5] The deities Ame-no-Koyane-no-mikoto and Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto then asked Amaterasu to rejoin the divine. She agreed, and light was restored to the earth.\r\n\r\nAme-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto is still worshiped today as a Shinto kami, spirits indigenous to Japan.[6] She is also known as Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, The Great Persuader, and The Heavenly Alarming Female.[7] She is depicted in kyōgen farce as Okame, a woman who revels in her sensuality\r\n\r\n---\r\nComplete \"Wikipedia\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto for links to more information\r\n\r\nh4.

With 1.7 m³ of habitable volume, the [[spacecraft]] was just large enough for the single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The spacecraft was designed by Max Faget and NASA's Space Task Group.\r\n\r\nDespite the [[astronaut]]s' test pilot experience NASA at first envisioned them as \"minor participants\" during their flights, causing many conflicts between the astronauts and engineers during the spacecraft's design. Nonetheless, contrary to other reports, the project's leaders always intended for pilots to be able to control their spacecraft, as they valued humans' ability to contribute to missions' success. John Glenn's manual attitude adjustments during the first orbital flight were an example of the value of such control.

The captain of this ship is [[Jeffrey Wilder]].\r\n\r\nAlthough one-quarter the size of the current Macross Class warships (being equivalent to a 400 meter class vessel typical of regular carriers) the Macross Quarter can transform from a warship (cruiser mode) to [[Storm Attacker]] mode (battle mode) for close combat. The Macross Quarter boasts high mobility and combat performance even though it is the size of a mid-scale warship.\r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter is a compound vessel consisting of five warships. The central hull consists of the main body and legs. The forward port side aircraft carrier is designated ARMD-L while the starboard side gunship is designated ARMD-R. The rear starboard-side mobile battery warship is BASTER-R and the rear port side mobile battery warship is BASTER-L. These design mechanisms were aimed at simplifying the transformation. Since each unit carries its own reaction engine and fold engine they can be deployed as independent warships or a fleet. \r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter has the capabilities of an aircraft carrier/amphibious assault spaceship, close-quarter combat capabilities through transformation to storm attack mode and can carry a maximum of 80 variable fighters and Destroids. \r\n\r\nThe Gatling-type buster cannon -which can be used as a Heavy Quantum Reaction gun- is suitable for heavy anti-ship combat. In addition to a high output reaction engine cluster, the Macross Quarter has the overall performance worthy of the \"Macross\" name despite being within the small, 400m class of carriers.\r\n\r\nThe Macross Frontier fleet's Yaesu Heavy Industries and the L.A.I. Corporation took charge of design and construction of a concept for a \"relatively small and excellent maneuverability variable attack space aircraft carrier\". \r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter was built in Macross Frontier's dock and when handed over to the S.M.S. upon completion, it was moored to a special pier on Island 1's port side. The vessel functioned as a central command and graveyard facility for the S.M.S. group. \r\n\r\nOriginally the Macross Quarter was registered as a \"Special Duty Operation Warship\" and when incorporated into the New U.N.

This makes the language harder to learn, though many agree it leads to much fewer errors popping up unexpectedly while your program is running.\r\n\r\nRust also has a notion of what is considered [b]safe[/b] and [b]unsafe[/b] code. Usually all rust code is considered safe. But if you put any code inside an unsafe block ([code]unsafe { some code here }[/code]) many of the strict rules of rust are ignored, which makes this code be considered unsafe. Unsafe code is necessary when doing things that safe rust do not support (like calling code from other programming languages).\r\nSome argue that this makes fatal errors easier to find (compared to other languages) since they are almost always found inside unsafe code.\r\n\r\nh4.
