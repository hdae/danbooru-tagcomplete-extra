His name comes from the incident where a servant angered his owner and hid behind a table to no avail because Oda used Hasebe to slice through the table and kill that servant. Shortly afterwards, he gave the sword to someone who wasn't even one of his trusted people. Because of that incident, Hasebe resents him. \r\n\r\nHasebe is portrayed as being serious, dutiful and extremely loyal to the Saniwa, to the point that his opening lines are \"If it's an order from the Master...\". Artists tend to give him a comically serious personality who's utterly obsessed with pleasing the Saniwa (a trait that often comes into play in more comedic side works, such as [i]Hanamaru[/i] or the official Anthalogy; see Pool #11476 for this portrayal).

Their defining features include:\r\n\r\n* [b]Non-Marking Soles[/b]: Boat shoes typically have soft, rubber soles with a siped (finely grooved) pattern. These grooves help channel water away, improving traction on wet surfaces without leaving marks on the deck.\r\n\r\n* [b]Water-Resistant Uppers[/b]: Most boat shoes are made from treated [[leather]] or canvas to repel water and reduce staining. The low-cut design also facilitates quick drying and makes them easy to slip on and off.\r\n\r\n* [b]Classic Lacing System[/b]: Many boat shoes use a 360-degree rawhide lace that surrounds the heel, allowing for a snug, adjustable fit.\r\n\r\n* [b]Origins and Brand Associations[/b]: They were popularized by Sperry (specifically, the Sperry Top-Sider) in the 1930s. Paul Sperry is credited with developing the first modern boat shoe after noticing his [[dog]]’s ability to run on ice without slipping—leading him to invent the siped sole.\r\n\r\nToday, boat shoes have transcended their maritime roots and are worn as stylish, casual footwear on and off the water. Their timeless look pairs well with [[shorts]], [[jeans]], and other laid-back outfits, making them a popular warm-weather staple.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231015,"created_at":"2025-03-12T07:00:23.689-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T07:00:23.689-04:00","title":"koi_dorei_mazo_seikatsu_class_mate_no_yuuwaku_kiss_de_seiheki_yuganda_doutei-kun","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["恋奴○マゾ生活_クラスメイトの誘惑キスで性癖歪んだ童貞くん"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231013,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:56:40.943-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:56:40.943-04:00","title":"sensei_no_yasashii_koroshikata","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["先生のやさしい殺し方"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231012,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:54:24.312-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:54:24.312-04:00","title":"chanto_suki_tte_ieru_ko_musou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ちゃんと好きって言える子無双"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231011,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:53:10.592-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:53:10.592-04:00","title":"kono_class_ni_gyaru_wa_inai","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["このクラスにギャルはいない"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231010,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:48:47.789-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:48:47.789-04:00","title":"haramu_made_midare_ike:_migawari_hanayome_to_gunpuku_no_mouai","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["孕むまで乱れいけ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231009,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:47:35.133-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:47:35.133-04:00","title":"kido_shintarou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["木戸慎太郎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231008,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:45:57.688-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:45:57.688-04:00","title":"toono_asako","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["遠野麻子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231007,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:44:21.886-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:44:21.886-04:00","title":"mushoku_tensei:_game_ni_nattemo_honki_dasu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["無職転生~ゲームになっても本気だす~"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231006,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:42:22.352-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:42:22.352-04:00","title":"yuri_influencer_futari_no_ecchi_na_yagai_katsudou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["百合いんふるえんさーふたりのエッチな野外活動"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231005,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:41:43.893-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:41:43.893-04:00","title":"kubitsuri_kikyuu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["首吊り気球"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231004,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:40:39.627-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:40:39.627-04:00","title":"karakai_jouzu_(?)_no_nishikata-san","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["からかい上手(?)の西片さん"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231003,"created_at":"2025-03-12T06:39:48.429-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:39:48.429-04:00","title":"natsuyasumi_wo_kawaii_onna_no_ko_de_sugosu_houhou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["夏休みを可愛い女の子で過ごす方法"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":166689,"created_at":"2023-06-10T11:17:02.387-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-12T06:39:44.174-04:00","title":"angle_grinder","body":"A handheld [[power tool]] used for grinding (abrasive cutting) and polishing.

Haku is a sad Vocaloid who just can't sing as well as Miku. She is always crying because of this and vents her frustration by drinking. Her image colors are silver and purple. Her character item is a sake bottle. She's also noted for her [[large breasts|curvier figure]] compared to Miku and has a decent following. Haku's name means \"speaking weak words\" ('speaking' here has connotation of a pent-up sigh or muttering.)\r\n\r\nThis created a trend of users labeling badly-made Vocaloid songs with voyakiloid, or \"shouting vocaloid.\" It is implied that it was Haku who sung those songs, and not Miku. Later on, she received several fan-made [[mikumikudance|MMD]] models and being treated as a \"genuine\" character rather than a byword for bad Vocaloid songs.\r\n\r\nHer usual attire consists of a [[crop top|cropped]] [[sleeveless shirt|sleeveless]] [[grey shirt]] with a [[purple necktie]], [[black pants]] with a [[purple belt]] tied around them, [[detached sleeves]], and a [[striped bow]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The project was not without its turbulence, as the mobile game ended its services in late 2016—just one month before the anime aired in early 2017, the first season of which was financially restricted, resulting in poor animation quality and mixed reviews from initial critics and viewers.\r\n\r\nDespite the 2015 game being closed down early—thus failing to give anime viewers context as had been planned—the anime was a surprise hit, due in no small part to scripting by director [[tatsuki (irodori)|Tatsuki]]; the show received very high ratings and viewership, miraculously reviving the dying franchise into a breakout success.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Nexon sold the [i]Kemono Friends[/i] franchise to [[Kadokawa]] who held the right of the franchise ever since.\r\n\r\nh4.
