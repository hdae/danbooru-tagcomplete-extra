The war began after the collapse of the first Republic of China which saw the country being divided between various rival warlords who fought to unite the country. In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)-led Republic of China under the leadership of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] managed to unite a large part of the country, however, conflict between the then allied Chinese Communist Party (CCP) resulted in a crackdown that forced the CCP on \"The Long March\" to the northern parts of the country between 1934 - 1935. The outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] in 1937 forced the KMT and CCP to work together to defend the country.\r\n\r\nAfter [[Japan]] was defeated in [[World War II]] in 1945, fighting between both parties resumed. While the KMT had a manpower and weaponry advantage, it was plagued with corruption and economical problems. Meanwhile, the smaller CCP forces led by [[Mao Zedong]] used a combination of disciplined guerilla fighters, hit-and-run tactics, and various propaganda methods to recruit more members. After several key warlords and troops defected to the CCP, the KMT lost the control of the mainland China in 1949 and retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]] while the CCP established the People's Republic of China (PRC) over it.\r\n\r\nAs there is no official armistice, the civil war is still considered ongoing, with tensions between mainland China and Taiwan and its complex political status remains an issue.\r\n\r\nh4.

She is a playable character in the game [[street_fighter_iv_(series)|Super Street Fighter IV]].\r\n\r\nMakoto is a young Japanese girl, trained in Rindoukan karate. Her karate style is very similar to that of Shotokan karate. Although having little fashion sense for a girl her age, she still hates it when she is mistaken for a boy. She develops something of a rivalry with kunoichi [[Ibuki (street fighter)|Ibuki]], as shown by their alternate opening when they fight each other.\r\n\r\nSince her father's death, Makoto's dojo has been floundering and her older brother decided to become a businessman, leaving Makoto to elevate her dojo back to its former glory. Horrified to discover the decrepit state the dojo is in, she first enters S.I.N.'s tournament in Super Street Fighter IV in order to win money to renovate it. During the tournament, she encounters and fights [[Fei Long]] in the hopes that the publicity will enhance Rindo-kan's reputation. Apparently she is the overall tournament winner - as her win quote against [[seth (street fighter)|Seth]] is the only one that says the character has become the tournament champ, and in her ending she says that she \"beats the pants off\" of all her opponents - however she didn't win any money since the tournament sponsor, Seth, was killed and S.I.N. disbanded. She decides to rebuild her fathers dojo by hand, and make money the old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nUltimately, she finds [[ryu (street fighter)|Ryu]] in 3rd Strike and challenges him to enhance her dojo's reputation. After her fight with Ryu, the publicity attracts a swarm of potential students to her dojo. Unfortunately, she enforces the rather counterproductive policy of rejecting aspiring students who are unable to defeat her first, and thus far none have.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["まこと","まこと(ストリートファイター)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":197946,"created_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:53.648-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:53.648-04:00","title":"nazuna_hakutou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ナズナ・ハクトウ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":197945,"created_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:43.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:43.000-04:00","title":"sequel_thirst","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SEQUEL_thirst"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":197944,"created_at":"2024-06-25T16:59:53.738-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-25T16:59:53.738-04:00","title":"prosthetic_weapon","body":"Depictions of a person who has replaced a missing limb with a weapon instead of an ordinary prosthesis.
