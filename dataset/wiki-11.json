The Bazooka saw extensive use on all fronts of the war, used against enemy bunkers, pillboxes, fortified positions, and even tanks. \r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in early 1943, many examples of the Bazooka fell into German hands. Impressed with the innovative idea, the Germans copied the Bazooka wholesale, enlarging the rocket and adding a shield to the tube to protect the shooter from backblast, calling the new weapon the [[panzerschreck]], or \"tank terror\".\r\n\r\nThe name \"Bazooka\" originated from its shape, which bears similarity to the tubular musical instrument invented and popularized by U.S. radio comedian Bob Burns in the 1930s. It is now used as a generic term for any manner of tube-like shoulder-fired rocket launcher, but that's not what this Danbooru tag should be used for.

Later, in August 2021, Cover announced [[hololive Error]], a horror-themed spin-off project. A year later, in June 2022, Cover announced [[Holoearth]], a game featuring various hololive members.

A [[dragon girl]] in human form. Designed by [[Yaman]].\r\n\r\nShe has [[very long hair|very long]] [[orange hair]] with a single [[blonde hair|yellow]] [[streaked hair|lock of hair]] near her forehead. Her regular hairstyle is [[straight hair]] with an [[ahoge]], [[hair intakes]] held with a [[black hairband]], [[fanged bangs|fanged]] [[blunt bangs]], [[sidelocks]] and a [[side braid]]. She also has a pair of [[dragon horns]] with a [[horn bow|bow]] on her right horn, [[pointy ears]], [[red eyes]] with [[white pupils|white]] [[slit pupils]], a long purple [[dragon tail]] (which she had a running gag of it being a [[butt plug]] [[anal tail|tail]]). She also has quite [[large breasts]], with her subsequent outfits making them [[huge breasts|noticeably larger]].\r\n\r\nShe is fluent in English, and quite eccentric (due to being a half-American). Hosted a morning \"news show\"-esque 20-minute program on weekdays named \"AsaCoco\" (Morning Coco), which usually ended up creating absurd memes - such as [[Himemori Luna]]'s English Corner, where the cute, childish princess constantly spews out obscenities, and most notably the drug \"[[asacoco]]\", a potent stimulant available to be delivered in a wide variety of forms ranging from needles to anal plugs.\r\n\r\nDespite her wild antics, insane gags and frequent foul language (which often got her into trouble with YouTube), she is very eager to help her friends if need be and has a mature, big sister-like approach to troublesome situations (though usually laced with some of her personal brand of humor to break the seriousness if it's too much).\r\n\r\nShe was considered to have the second largest bust in hololive after [[Tsukumo Sana]], even toppling [[Shirogane Noel]]'s K-night cups. She was also significantly taller than the rest of the hololive girls (180 cm, compared with [[Omega Alpha]], who is the second tallest at 175 cm without counting the gigantic Sana), especially the rest of the 4th generation (Kanata, Towa and Watame are all about 150 cm tall, Luna is the shortest at 140 cm, boosted to 150 cm with her shoes and crown).\r\n\r\nShe was the real-life roommate of [[Amane Kanata]], and the apartment that they lived in together was called by other visiting hololive members as the \"KanaCoco House\". This means that they could (and had several times) make appearances on each other's streams.\r\n\r\nShe is in fact a big [[Ryuu ga Gotoku (series)|]] fangirl and has been known to play games of the series. In fact, her name and her title of \"Chairwoman\" (\"会長\" - [i]Kaichou[/i]) are direct references to [[Kiryu Kazuma]].\r\n\r\nKiryu Coco reached one million YouTube subscribers on February 17, 2021.\r\n\r\nShe announced her graduation from Hololive on June 8, 2021. Her final act was a live concert on July 1, 2021, which became one of the most viewed live streams in Hololive and VTuber history, reaching over 498,000 concurrent viewers.\r\n\r\nh4.

However, there are other variations, including one well-known recipe which uses Worcestershire sauce and shredded cabbage. To differentiate the two, the former is sometimes called \"[i]Tamago-toji [bound-together-with-egg] katsudon[/i],\" whereas the latter is called \"[i]Sauce Katsudon[/i].\"\r\n\r\nA common trope in Japanese crime dramas is for the detective to eat katsudon while interrogating a suspect. The typical heart-of-gold type detective would think, \"if this guy goes to the slammer, he'd never be able to eat anything as good as this again,\" and then use his own coin to order a katsudon delivered straight to the suspect's house. Then the suspect would be moved so much as to turn himself in and confess to the crime, tears streaming down his face. And so goes the cliche. For these stories, there is an explanation that katsudon was the most expensive food that one could get on a police officer's salary. \r\n\r\nThis is nowadays only seen as a joke or stereotype, but Japanese people have come up with the expression, \"let someone eat katsudon,\" which carries the same meaning as \"read someone their Miranda rights\" (see post #1184509).\r\n\r\nh4.
