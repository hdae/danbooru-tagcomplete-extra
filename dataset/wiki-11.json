Final boss of [[Touhou]]'s [i][[Subterranean Animism]][/i] and later a playable character in [i][[touhou_hisoutensoku|Hisoutensoku]][/i]. A hell raven who absorbed the powers of a [[yatagarasu]], giving her the power to manipulate nuclear fusion which she then used to try to conquer the surface. Her nickname is \"Okuu\" (おくう), which is based on an alternate reading of the kanji in her name. Both Reiuji and [[Kaenbyou Rin]] are pets of [[Komeiji Satori]] and live in [[Chireiden]]. \r\n\r\nHer (fan-given) catchprase is '[[Unyu]]'; she is also known as [[circled 6|⑥]] because, like [[Cirno]] (whose nickname is [[circled 9|⑨]]), she is rather dumb and the strongest of the Former Hell, only difference is, she actually [i]is[/i] strong.  \"⑥\" also reflects her status as a Stage 6 boss, and the notion of her heat-based powers being the inverse of Cirno and her ice abilities.\r\n\r\nHer spellcards are announced with a highly visible [[radiation symbol]] and while [[pointing up]] towards the [[black sun]], often while holding her [[arm cannon]] based on a [[control rod (touhou)|]].\r\n\r\nShe has [[long hair|long]] [[black hair|black]] or [[brown hair]] tied with a [[green bow|green]] [[hair bow]] and [[red eyes]], including her [[third eye]] on her chest. Her outfit is a [[collared shirt|collared]] [[white shirt]] with [[puffy short sleeves]] and sometimes [[frilled shirt|frills on the bottom]] and the [[frilled shirt collar|collar]], a [[frilled skirt|frilled]] [[green skirt]], a [[white cape]] with a [[starry sky print|starry]] [[print cape|print]] on the [[two-sided cape|reverse side]] over her [[black wings|black]] [[feathered wings|wings]], [[black socks]], and [[brown shoes|brown]] [[loafers]].\r\n\r\nh4.

While it originally aired on CBS during the first season, it later aired on CW starting from the second season thanks to a popular crossover episode with CW's [[The Flash (series)|]] in the first season. \r\n\r\nWhile the show was originally set in a different universe than CW's \"Arrowverse\", which includes [[Green Arrow (series)|Arrow]], The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow, the multiple episodes crossover \"[b]Crisis on Infinite Earths[/b]\" would combine them into one universe including [[Batwoman]] and [[Black Lightning (dc)|]]. \r\n\r\nThe series follows Kara Danvers, a young woman at CatCo Worldwide Media in National City, who is actually a Kryptonian and the cousin of [[Superman]]. \r\n\r\nWhen the planet Krypton was about to explode, Kara's parents send her on an escape pod to not only escape to Earth but to protect her baby cousin Kal-El who was sent on another escape pod. However, Kara's ship got knocked off course into the Phantom Zone, where she gets trapped, frozen in time before her ship escapes and Kara arrives on Earth to discover not only 24 years have passed but her cousin, now Clark Kent, is now an adult and a superhero called Superman. To take care of her and learn how to live like a regular human, Superman sends his cousin to his trusted friends, the Danvers family, to raise Kara.\r\n\r\nIn the present, Kara one day uses her powers to secertly stop a plane from crashing, which the press praise her heroics and dub her \"Supergirl\". Deciding to be a superhero just like her cousin, Kara embraces her Kryptonian heritage and becomes the defender of National City. Helping her is her adoptive older sister, [[Alex Danvers]], who is an agent of the Department of Extra-Normal Operations (DEO), an American agency that protects Earth from hostile aliens and [[Jimmy Olsen]], Superman's best friend.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":126973,"created_at":"2021-08-15T02:53:08.801-04:00","updated_at":"2025-08-27T19:01:48.331-04:00","title":"deus_prometheus_(grimms_notes)","body":"The endgame main villain of [[Grimms Notes]]. \r\n\r\nHis [[voice actor]] is [[Toriumi Kousuke|Toriumi Kousuke]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It is considered the first true 3D FPS game, unlike [[doom (series)|DooM]], which was actually 2.5D.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players must find their way out of various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using a wide array of guns. The game's monsters were inspired by the creatures from [[h_p_lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. \r\n\r\nThe successor to id's [[doom (series)|Doom]] series, Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor in many ways. Unlike the Doom engine before it, the Quake engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. \r\n\r\nQuake was programmed by John Carmack, Michael Abrash and John Cash. The level and scenarios were designed by American McGee, Sandy Petersen, John Romero and Tim Willits. The graphics were designed by Adrian Carmack, and Kevin Cloud. Music and sound design was by Trent Reznor, founder of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The game engine developed for Quake, the \"Quake engine\", popularized several major advances in the 3D game genre: polygonal models instead of prerendered sprites; full 3D level design instead of a 2.5D map; prerendered lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with QuakeC), which popularized fan-created modifications or \"mods\".\r\n\r\nAfter DooM helped popularize multiplayer deathmatches, Quake added various multiplayer options. Various multiplayer mods were developed including Team Fortress and Capture The Flag.\r\n\r\nThe game received much acclaim on release and its commercial success led to several sequels, starting with [[Quake 2]], which abandoned the gothic stylings of the original for a [[science fiction]] theme. Because of this, Quake has since been recognized as one of the greatest achievements of the video game industry, influencing games that came after it, as well as the artforms of user mods and machinima.\r\n\r\nh4.

Compression shorts are similar to bike shorts, but aren't designed with biking in mind and thus lack things like padding to reduce discomfort from long rides. Compression shorts are sometimes used by some women to conceal their [[panties]] beneath their [[skirt]], especially for those in women's sports where their uniform has a skirt, such as [[field hockey]] or [[lacrosse]]. \r\n\r\nIn Japan, these are also known as spats, and this meaning has spread across otaku spaces.
