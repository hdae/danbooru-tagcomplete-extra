The games usually feature simple plots; the most common theme is that of Bowser, the primary antagonist, kidnapping Princess Peach, whom Mario saves.\r\n\r\nDespite the plots usually being very simple, the Mario role-playing games tend to have deeper plots, often involving enemies other than Bowser (many of which involve Bowser actually teaming up with Mario), with aspirations for world domination. Mario and friends have been featured in 200 games, and the series has sold over 200 million copies total, making it the best-selling video game series of all time.\r\n\r\nh4. Characters\r\n\r\nh6.

Yukata does not require juban to be worn underneath.² Juban can still be worn with yukata, but it should never be visible, which it is with kimono.¹ if you can see the layer underneath the collar, it is not a yukata, at least in presentation.\r\n\r\nThe [[obi]] can also help to distinguish kimono from yukata. Yukata is worn with a thinner hanhaba obi, while kimono is typically worn with a formal silk obi, more elaborate in style and accessories. Kimono is sometimes worn with hanhaba obi, but it is out of the ordinary to wear yukata with an elaborate formal obi.¹\r\n\r\n* !post #8960587\r\n\r\nh4.

History\r\nFounded in 1721, the [[Russia]]n Empire modernised under Peter the Great, who introduced Western reforms and built the new capital, Saint Petersburg. The empire grew through wars, including victories over the Swedish Empire and the Ottoman Empire, and annexed regions like Poland, Siberia, and the Caucasus. The 19th century saw the height of its power under [[Alexander I]] and [[Nicholas I]], but internal unrest, serfdom, and defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905) weakened it. The 1917 Revolutions marked its collapse, leading to the rise of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nh4.Symbolism\r\nThe [[double-headed eagle]], a symbol of imperial authority, adorned the empire’s coat of arms.

It has since been taken up as an open-source project by multiple modders as \"Elona+\" and received expansions, but the original plot is likely never to be finished as it was intended.\r\n\r\n\"Elona\" is a portmanteau of \"Eternal League Of NefiA\", a mysterious (to the point of being only mentioned once in the unfinished plot) organization apparently behind fate. \r\n\r\nElona takes place on a world called Irva, where the world is tormented by the blowing of the etherwinds, which cause mutations that kill humanoids and make monsters more powerful and ferocious. Because the etherwinds come from the Vindale Forest, home of the [[elf]]-like Elea, the world stands ready to bring war to Vindale.\r\n\r\nElona blends standard RPG tropes with a Lovecraftian theme (including a Sanity meter). It also features guns, cyborgs, steampunk, references to the likes of [[Aliens (1986)|]] and [[Bioshock (series)|]] and many other dissimilar tropes to create an oddball fantasy/sci-fi kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nYou can read a translation of the plot here: [s]http://elona.squares.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5025[/s]\r\n\r\nh4.

In August 2016, [b]Princess Connect! Re:Dive[/b] was announced as a remake of the original game and advertised as an Anime RPG.\r\n\r\nIn February 2018, the game was officially released for Android and iOS. The remake is notable for using an anime-style format to tell its story complete with an \"opening song\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8uuBB7SoM], \"cutscenes\":[https://youtu.be/xCX1Qx40sUM?t=447], \"ending credits\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XXC4TSTuxU], and even a next \"episode preview\":[https://youtu.be/xCX1Qx40sUM?t=739]. Wit Studio is credited for the anime portions of the game. A global version was released on January 19, 2021, and later \"ended\":[https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2023/3/30/an-important-update-regarding-princess-connect-re-dive] on April 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay in the remake is heavily reliant on team composition to progress through the more difficult portions of the game and encourages raising multiple characters to complete certain challenges. Despite differing initial rarities, all characters can be raised to the maximum rarity which unlocks their full stories and maximum potential.\r\n\r\nIn the original story, the game was set in \"Legend of Astrum\", an MMO where the player would meet various girls and recruit them. Because of the MMO setting, each girl had a fantasy version and a real-life version. The story in the remake plays out as a sequel, starting the narrative with a \"Bad End\" to the original series in which the characters remain in the MMO, unaware of there ever being a separate real world.\r\n\r\nh4.

Established in June 1917 under [[Lavr Kornilov]], commander of the Russian Eighth Army, it began as the 1st Shock Detachment to counter the crumbling discipline of the post-February Revolution army. Initiated by [[Aleksei Brusilov]]’s call for \"revolutionary shock battalions,\" the unit was renamed in Kornilov’s honor in August 1917 and became known for its fierce loyalty and combat prowess.\r\n\r\nLed initially by Captain [[Mitrofan Nezhentsev]], the regiment grew from a volunteer force of officers and soldiers into a symbol of anti-Bolshevik resistance. After the [[October Revolution]], it joined Lavr Kornilov in southern Russia, becoming one of the first units of the Volunteer Army alongside generals like [[Mikhail Alekseyev]] and [[Anton Denikin]]. The regiment fought in major campaigns, including the [[Ice March of 1918]], where Kornilov died in battle. It later expanded into a brigade and division, enduring heavy losses until its evacuation from Crimea in 1920 under [[Pyotr Wrangel]].\r\n\r\nThe Kornilovites were renowned for their distinctive red-and-black uniforms and skull-and-crossbones insignia, reflecting their oath to fight to the death. They clashed repeatedly with the [[soviet_army|Red Army]], led by figures like [[Leon Trotsky]], and remained a disciplined force amid the chaos of civil war.\r\n\r\nh4.

Later rulers, such as [[Catherine the Great]], expanded its reach and influence. By the 19th century, commanders like [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] led it to victory against [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1812, cementing its reputation. In World War I, under [[Nicholas II]], the army initially mobilised millions but faced heavy losses and logistical failures, contributing to its collapse during the 1917 upheavals.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Russian Army was known for its vast conscripted ranks, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. It ceased to exist after the Bolsheviks, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the monarchy, with many of its remnants joining the [[White Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It pitted the Bolshevik-led [[soviet_army|Red Army]] against the anti-Bolshevik [[imperial_russian_army|White Army]] and various other factions, including foreign interventionists, in a brutal struggle for control of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe war erupted after the Bolsheviks, under [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government in the [[October Revolution]]. The Red Army, organized by [[Leon Trotsky]], aimed to establish a socialist state. Opposing them was the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, liberals, and anti-Bolshevik socialists, led by figures like [[Alexander Kolchak]] and [[Anton Denikin]]. Other groups, such as the anarchist Black Army led by [[Nestor Makhno]] and the peasant [[Green_Army|Green Armies]], fought against both major sides.\r\n\r\nForeign powers also played a role, with the Allied nations (Britain, France, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Germany) intervening at various points. Key moments, like the [[Battle of Tsaritsyn]] influenced by [[Joseph Stalin]], shaped the conflict’s course. The war ended in 1922 with a Bolshevik victory, laying the foundation for the [[Soviet Union]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":198718,"created_at":"2024-07-04T08:10:16.613-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-04T12:43:42.179-04:00","title":"list_of_songs_from_gakuen_idolmaster","body":"A list of songs from [[Gakuen Idolmaster]].\r\n\r\nh2.
