Secretly completed by Odel Bernett, its control system is specifically turned for his younger brother, Odin Bernett, and the mobile suit played a key role in stopping OZ Prize and the OZ-15AGX Hydra Gundam. Like the OZX-GU01LOB Gundam L.O. Booster, the Griepe can transform into a high-speed flight mode, bolstered by a revolutionary propulsion engine developed by Mark Bernett, the late father of Odel and Odin.\r\n\r\nLike the earlier G-UNITs, the Griepe has a modular design and the PX System which takes advantage of the pilot's increased adrenaline during combat and also increases the performance of the mobile suit. However, the system has a time limit which if passed has serious consequences for both the pilot and the suit. The suit can use a beam lancer and the hyper mega particle launcher in MS Mode, while its MA Mode mounts a buster mega particle cannon under its nose. There is also the Assault Mode, halfway between MS and MA Mode, for firing the cannon without fully transforming. \r\n\r\n\"Excerpt from the Gundam Wiki\":[https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/OZ-19MASX_Gundam_Griepe]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガンダムグリープ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":93034,"created_at":"2017-12-15T14:38:12.519-05:00","updated_at":"2021-08-07T21:58:25.437-04:00","title":"mordred_(fate/prototype)","body":"The [[mordred (fate)|Mordred]] that appears in the universe of [[Fate/Prototype]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["旧モードレッド"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":112552,"created_at":"2020-04-20T00:20:13.609-04:00","updated_at":"2021-08-07T21:10:29.117-04:00","title":"internet_explorer_(webcomic)","body":"[b]Internet Explorer[/b] is a webcomic series written by [[Merryweather]] and illustrated by [[Hinghoi]], in which various web browsers and other internet services are portrayed as anime girl personifications.\r\n\r\nh4.

The expedition included Ulrich, a powerful Hume swordsman, his friend Raogrimm, the Galkan Talekeeper and keeper of the race's memories, and Cornelia, a beautiful Hume female warrior.\r\n\r\nThe expedition through the Northlands was going as planned until a rift began forming between Ulrich and Raogrimm. The Galka was advocating peace with the Beastmen, a thought Ulrich did not agree with. Also, Raogrimm had proven to be the better warrior of the two, despite Ulrich's prowess with his blade. Then there was Cornelia; the Hume female and the Galka had developed a secret affection for one another, and Ulrich was green with envy.\r\n\r\nThe day finally came when Ulrich could no longer control his jealousy. The Hume surprised Raogrimm, pulling his sword and moving to kill him. Cornelia, faithful to the end, stepped in front of Ulrich's blade and Ulrich ran her through. Raogrimm took Cornelia's dead body in his arms and let out a mighty roar as the pain of losing the one he loved washed over him.\r\n\r\nUlrich hid the truth of what happened when he returned home from his expedition. The rage and sadness of the betrayal, however, resonated through the world and into the memory of the Magicite Crystals.\r\n\r\nThirty years after the event, as you find pieces of Magicite Crystals hidden throughout Vana'diel, you catch the first glimpse of the horrid betrayal: the event which ignited Raogrimm's hatred and allowed him to resurrect himself as the Shadow Lord.\r\n\r\nTwenty years before the dawn of the Age of Adventurers, a terrifying demon emerged from the frozen heights of Xarcabard. Nobody knew where this demon came from, and none of the nations were prepared for his wrath. This kindred demon united the beastmen of Vana'diel against the five races of Altana in a war referred to nowadays as the Crystal War, or the Great War of 20 years ago.\r\n\r\nThis demon was called the Shadow Lord.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the Crystal War, an elite squad of warriors fought through Castle Zvahl Baileys and cornered the Shadow Lord in his throne room. There the mighty demon was defeated... or so the world thought.\r\n\r\nIn the the Age of Adventurers, the dark spirit of the Shadow Lord began to stir once more. Motivated by this great force, the beastmen of Vana'diel set in motion a plot to revive their revered leader. Before this plot could envelop the world in a second Great War, a young adventurer joined forces with veterans of the original war to foil the sinister plot. In the end, the Shadow Lord did rise again, but the adventurer was there waiting. An epic battle ensued, and at the end of the battle only the adventurer is left standing.\r\n\r\nThe Shadow Lord then reveals his true identity: he is Raogrimm, the former Galka Talekeeper consumed by the torment and pain of generations of his people.\r\n\r\nIn this final defeat, the Shadow Lord believes he can rest peacefully.\r\n\r\nDefeating the Shadow Lord will grant the player the rare Rank 6.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":126730,"created_at":"2021-08-05T15:38:25.531-04:00","updated_at":"2021-08-05T15:39:11.248-04:00","title":"halua","body":"[spoiler]Emil's sister, before and after she was turned into a weapon.[/spoiler]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120401,"created_at":"2021-01-28T13:09:36.703-05:00","updated_at":"2021-08-05T14:51:18.280-04:00","title":"dungeon_busters","body":"A light novel written by Toma Shinozaki and illustrated by [[Senri gan]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ダンジョン・バスターズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":56983,"created_at":"2014-08-02T12:32:42.945-04:00","updated_at":"2021-08-05T14:51:18.268-04:00","title":"sanae_(gan)","body":"[[Original]] character by [[senri gan]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":121420,"created_at":"2021-03-03T03:13:45.407-05:00","updated_at":"2021-08-05T12:26:42.565-04:00","title":"gm_cold_districts_type","body":"[b]RGM-79D GM Cold Districts Type[/b]\r\nA specialist variation of the [[gm_command|GM Command]] intended for operation in cold climate situations.

If you thought you caught a glimpse of her, she'll vanish. The moment you think she's in your grasp, you'll be empty-handed. Lucy is a genius in any knowledge or skills related to crimes. She is naturally talented in magic, gymnastics, and athletics. She also has doctorates in Medicine, Security, Psychology, and Alchemy. Each degree she earned has a different name written on them, though. She's known as the princess of crime among criminals, and lots of them uses her name out of admiration.\r\n\r\nShe only commits crimes for the fun and thrill. Her crimes' patterns and their severity fluctuate depending on her mood. If you can see her and she's almost within your grasp, that means she wants to play. When she's not in the mood, you would pass by without even noticing her or her criminal act.\r\n Lucy's favorite part of committing a crime is the thrill, excitement, and chaos happening during the chase. Apparently, a just hero tenaciously chasing after her gives her the most fun. Using her fantastic wordplay to cloud the hero's judgment and playing mind games is also an added bonus. Of course, just because she had fun, that doesn't mean she'll return the stolen items or money.\r\n\r\nThere's very little known about Lucy. No one knows her exact age, her past, even whether the name 'Lucy is her real name. Some people suggest Lucy became a trickster because of her troubled youth or the corruption in society, but she merely laughs at all these analyses. 'It's a grave mistake to think something other than me created my identity,' she claims. She's just having fun!\r\n\r\nDespite being a criminal for her enjoyment, Lucy's not great at making jokes. She wants to deliver a fitting joke during the act but always ends up delivering the punch line in the wrong way.\r\n Even if she comes up with something clever, her delivery usually ruins it. Lucys feelings get very hurt when the tension dies down from her bad delivery of jokes.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":37397,"created_at":"2012-09-03T19:41:48.407-04:00","updated_at":"2021-07-25T05:30:36.503-04:00","title":"you_shimizu","body":"Artist, illustrator.
