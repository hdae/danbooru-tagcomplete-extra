Gameplay revolves around using a crosshair to shoot down enemies and avoid harming civilians. It runs on the Namco System 2 Plus arcade hardware.\r\n\r\nSteel Gunner is Namco's first [[light gun]] video game. The game was produced by Sawano Kazunori, who was previously a designer on games such as [[Galaxian]] and [[King & Balloon]]. Namco engineer Toyama Shigeki produced the arcade cabinet and light guns, and worked as a planner closely with the development team. The prototype models of the guns were originally depicted as being more futuristic. Namco executives instead decided to use them for [[Golly! Ghost!]], forcing Toyama to design a new version of the guns in two days though having complete fiberglass prototypes of the original designs. \r\n\r\nSteel Gunner was well-received by critics for its gameplay, visuals and overall presentation, often being compared to [[Operation Wolf]]. A direct sequel, [[Steel Gunner 2]], was released in 1992.\r\n\r\nh4.External links\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia article\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Gunner","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スティールガンナー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":150982,"created_at":"2022-09-24T21:51:09.671-04:00","updated_at":"2022-09-25T02:15:10.352-04:00","title":"lennox_rose","body":"Lennox Rose is a cel-shaded skin in the Chapter 3 Season 4 [[Fortnite]] Battlepass.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Lennox_Rose","レノックスローズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":150992,"created_at":"2022-09-25T02:12:38.400-04:00","updated_at":"2022-09-25T02:14:20.476-04:00","title":"steel_gunner_2","body":"[b]Steel Gunner 2[/b] is a 1992 first-person [[mecha]] shooter [[video game]] developed and released by [[Namco]] for the [[arcade]]s. \r\n\r\nIt is the sequel to [[Steel Gunner]], which had been released in 1990.\r\n\r\nh4.External links\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia article\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Gunner_2","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スティールガンナー2"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":150991,"created_at":"2022-09-25T02:01:04.624-04:00","updated_at":"2022-09-25T02:01:04.624-04:00","title":"gargoyle_mecha_suit","body":"A fictional [[police]] [[mecha]] from the [[Steel Gunner]] [[video game]] by [[Namco]].\r\n\r\nThe [b]Gargoyle Mecha Suit[/b] is a [[power armor]] used by the [[Neo Arc Police Force]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":150989,"created_at":"2022-09-25T01:51:40.796-04:00","updated_at":"2022-09-25T01:51:40.796-04:00","title":"ookami_garuru","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["大噛がるる"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":60916,"created_at":"2014-12-11T19:54:42.636-05:00","updated_at":"2022-09-25T01:15:19.270-04:00","title":"flower_eyepatch","body":"An [[eyepatch]] with a [[flower]] on it.\r\n\r\nThis tag is for actual eyepatches only, for example, if you can see the fabric or strings attached to the flower.
