Commissioned on the same day as her sister on 30 September 1933, their trials and initial operations revealed severe stability and maneuverability problems arising from IJN specifications to have them carry identical armament to the larger [i]Fubuki[/i]-class on a lighter displacement. These problems forced the pair into a refit that saw their tall bridges, funnels, and masts lowered while one of their three triple torpedo mounts was removed.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the war, she was assigned with her sisters as Destroyer Division 21 and saw action in the Dutch East Indies and Aleutian campaigns, the latter was where she was sunk by a US submarine on 4 July 1942, with [[Inazuma (Kancolle)|]] rescuing her survivors.\r\n\r\nh4.

She is nicknamed [i]Hungry Wolf[/i], which was (allegedly) given during the naval review celebrating King George VI's coronation where she was Japan's representative, with regards to her living conditions, described as \"Spartan\" compared to those of other navies in attendance. Because of this nickname, it's not uncommon to draw her with [[wolf ears]] and/or [[fangs]].\r\n\r\nA running gag portrays her as a \"Christmas Cake\"; a woman above 25 who for whatever reason is unable to find a candidate for marriage, a reference to her namesake mountain's association with the folk hero Kintaro, who was raised in Mount Ashigara by a Yama-uba: a mountain hag.

The game was designed by Yotsui Kouichi, a.k.a. \"Isuke\":[http://strider.wikia.com/wiki/Isuke].\r\n\r\nIt became one of Capcom's early hits before [[Street Fighter II (series)|]], revered for its innovative gameplay, multilingual voice clips during cutscenes (presented in English, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Spanish) as well as its epic and diverse soundtrack (created by female video game composer \"Junko Tamiya\":http://capcom.wikia.com/wiki/Junko_Tamiya ).\r\n\r\nA [[Sega Mega Drive]]/Sega Genesis port of the  arcade version was released in 1990 and it quickly became one of the best selling and most critically acclaimed videogame adaptations for that system.\r\n\r\nA [[NES]] console version of the game was released in the United States only during 1989. This was an RPG, adventure and action adaptation with a plot and characters different from the arcade machine and more related to the Strider manga. \r\n\r\nThe manga based on the franchise was released in Japan a whole year before the game, illustrated and written by Tatsumi Wada, and serialized in the monthly magazine [i]Comic Computique[/i] from May to October 1988, spanning six issues. A single volume collection was later published on November 10, 1989. A short prequel story, titled [i]Strider Hiryu Gaiden[/i], was published following the completion of the main series and is not included in the collected edition.\r\n\r\nUnder license from Capcom USA, U.S. Gold and Tiertex produced a Strider video game sequel in Europe titled [i]Strider II[/i] (released in North America as [i]Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns[/i]) for various computer platforms, as well as the Mega Drive, Game Gear, and Master System. This European produced sequel was never released in Japan.\r\n\r\nAn unofficial \"spiritual\" sequel called [[Cannon Dancer]] was created in 1996 by [i]Isuke[/i]. \r\n\r\nCapcom later produced an official video game sequel, unrelated to the Tiertex produced Strider Returns and to Cannon Dancer, titled [i]Strider 2[/i]. It was released for the arcades and the [[PlayStation 1]] in 2000.\r\n\r\nA new remake of the first arcade game called [i]\"Strider HD\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strider_%282014_video_game%29 [/i] was developed by Californian studio Double Helix Games and Capcom's Osaka studio. It was released in early 2014 for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]] and Windows.\r\n\r\nh4.
