The Joseon period has left a substantial legacy to modern Korea; much of modern Korean culture, etiquette, norms, and societal attitudes toward current issues, along with the modern [[Korean text|Korean language and its dialects]], derive from the culture and traditions of Joseon. Modern Korean bureaucracy and administrative divisions were also established during the Joseon period. \r\n\r\nIt was founded by [[Yi Seong-gye]] in July 1392 and replaced by the [[Korean Empire]] in October 1897. The kingdom was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of [[Goryeo]] in what is today the city of [[Kaesong]]. Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day [[Seoul]]. The kingdom's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amrok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens. \r\n\r\nDuring its 500-year duration, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideals and doctrines in Korean society. Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new state's ideology. [[Buddhism]] was accordingly discouraged, and occasionally Buddhists faced persecutions. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the Korean peninsula and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. In the 1590s, the kingdom was severely weakened due to the two failed Japanese invasions of 1592 and 1598. Several decades later, Joseon was invaded by the Later Jin dynasty and the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1627 and 1636–1637 respectively, leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the \"hermit kingdom\" in Western literature. After the end of these invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and technological development. What power the kingdom recovered during its isolation waned as the 18th century came to a close. Faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure, and rebellions at home, the kingdom declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\r\n\r\nh4.

Generally used in the sense of: 1. To finish a given [[horse girl]]'s training scenario in the [[Umamusume]] game; 2. To get along very well or \"buddy buddy\" with a given girl (or [[Kiryuuin Aoi]]); or 3. To \"go all the way\" or do all sorts of implied hanky panky things with a given girl (or again, [[Kiryuuin Aoi]]). \r\n\r\nEffectively used as a euphemism in most fan comics, especially in 'comedic' scenarios, where it usually involves a girl going [[yandere]] on the [[Trainer (umamusume)|]] and alleging the latter [i]umapyoi[/i]-ing the other girls. Occasionally it is [[Happy Meek (Umamusume)|]] accusing [[Kiryuuin Aoi]] (of going out with the [[Trainer (umamusume)|]]), as a reference to one of the in-game events.\r\n\r\nA common variation used by fans (but not in official media) is \"onsen umapyoi\", occasionally abbreviated to \"onsenpyoi\" (温泉ぴょい). This can refer to either: 1. to finish a given [[horse girl]]'s training scenario with the semi-secret hot spring event unlocked, which requires the player to randomly acquire the Hot Spring Tickets in that scenario and win the URA final, or 2. from the above, to \"go all the way\" at the hot spring [i]ryokan[/i] with a given girl (or, yet again, [[Kiryuuin Aoi]]). \r\n\r\nSince the release of the Aoharu training mode, [[Kashimoto Riko]] has joined [[Kiryuuin Aoi]] in the list of possible umapyoi-ees (or, alternatively, umapyoi-ers).\r\n\r\nThe song also features other 'nonsensical' portmanteau words such as [i]umadacchi[/i], [i]sukidacchi[/i] and [i]umapoi[/i] (without the 'y'), all of which are also co-opted by the fanbase for pretty much the same meanings as [i]umapyoi[/i] above. As such, these examples can also be tagged umapyoi.\r\n\r\nUsage of all these four words has also spread to other fanbases.\r\n\r\nThis tag should generally not be used when the words occur as part of the [[Umapyoi Densetsu]] song, i.e. the characters are singing the song normally in their original context.\r\n\r\nh4.
