The games were released on the [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Playstation Vita]], and [[Playstation 3]].\r\n\r\nGameplay consists of tapping and holding buttons corresponding to icons on the screen while listening to various Vocaloid songs. You can dress each Vocaloid in unique [[list_of_project_diva_modules|Modules]] (costumes) to dance in during each song, which you must unlock by clearing different conditions depending on the module. When not playing the rhythm games, you can view songs in PV mode, or interact with the Vocaloids themselves in the DIVA Room.\r\n\r\nThis tag may be used for images that reference Project DIVA in some way, but that don't depict modules from any of the games. Do not use the [[Vocaloid]] tag if the image does not include any Vocaloid characters in it.\r\n\r\nh4.

The term [i]mono no aware[/i] (物の哀れ, literally 'the pathos of things') was coined by 18th century scholar Motoori Norinaga to describe this concept as a theme found in classical Japanese literature, and associated it with the cherry blossom motif. \r\n\r\nThe white-colored autumn and winter blossoms (冬桜, [i]fuyuzakura[/i]) of the higan cherry tree ([i]Prunus subhirtella autumnalis[/i]) are a notable variant, coming into bloom during those seasons. \r\n\r\nIn anime and manga, besides straightforward symbolization of youth and verve, the [[flower symbol|symbol]] may be used to denote gentle and/or affectionate characters; though this usage can sometimes be ironic.

It debuted on July 3, 1983 in Japan. The weekly series lasted 35 episodes. \r\n\r\nOrguss was the second part of [i]\"The Super Dimension Trilogy\"[/i] from [[Big West]], preceded by [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross|The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]] (1982) and then followed by [[Choujikuu Kidan Southern Cross|The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]] (1984). All these series were related in name only.\r\n\r\nThe first [[Orguss]] series had mechanical designs by [[Miyatake Kazutaka]] and character designs by [[Mikimoto Haruhiko]].\r\n\r\nIt is notable for being one of the first anime titles with an opening title song ([i]\"Hyouryuu\"[/i]), composed, arranged and sung by an American musician (the late [b]Casey Rankin[/b]).\r\n\r\nAlso of note is its main plot. While many mecha anime of the time and afterwards were [[space]] operas set mostly in an outer space environment Orguss dealt with the concepts of multiverses, alternate dimensions and/or different realities for the most part. \r\n\r\nThis series is also one of the first sci-fi anime works to depict a [[space elevator]], along with [[uchuu_kuubo_blue_noah|Space Carrier Blue Noah]].\r\n\r\nh4.
