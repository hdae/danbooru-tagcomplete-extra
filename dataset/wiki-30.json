Consult the [[help:cheatsheet|cheat sheet]] for a full guide on searching posts. See the [[tag groups]] for existing tags.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging guidelines\r\n\r\nWhen you're tagging a post, use the following guidelines:\r\n\r\nh6. Replace spaces with underscores\r\n\r\nFor example, [code]maria-sama ga miteru[/code] becomes [code]maria-sama_ga_miteru[/code]. Spaces are used to separate tags.\r\n\r\nh6. Character names\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat complicated. In general, use whatever order the source material uses. Failing this, use the ordering the character's nationality suggests. This typically means LastName FirstName order for Asian names, and FirstName LastName order for Western names.\r\n\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some characters use FirstName LastName order despite having Asian-sounding names. [[Subaru Nakajima]] is a good example of this (in all official promotional artwork FirstName LastName order is used). There is nothing we can do but shake our heads.\r\n\r\nSome characters have a mixture of Asian and Western names. Refer to the source material for these cases. Failing that, the general rule is, use whatever ordering the character's last name suggests. Asuka Langley Souryuu has a Japanese last name, so it would become [[Souryuu Asuka Langley]]. Akira Ferrari has an Italian last name, so it becomes [[Akira Ferrari]]. But again, there are exceptions to this, like [[Setsuna F. Seiei]].\r\n\r\nh6. Full Names\r\n\r\nUsing full names reduces the chances of collisions.\r\n\r\nh6#restrictions. Tag name restrictions\r\n\r\n* Must not be blank, i.e. must contain at least one character\r\n* Cannot contain any asterisks ( * ) or commas ( , )\r\n* Cannot begin with a tilde ( ~ ) or dash ( - )\r\n* Cannot begin or end with an underscore ( _ ), or contain consecutive underscores\r\n* Must contain only printable characters\r\n** [code]!\"#$%&'()+-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~[/code]\r\n* Cannot begin with a metatag and \":\"\r\n** Example: [code]pool:test[/code]\r\n** See \"List of available metatags\":[/wiki_pages/help:cheatsheet.html#dtext-n4]\r\n* \"new\" and \"search\" are reserved and cannot be used\r\n* [b]*_(cosplay)[/b] tags must have an existing character tag\r\n** E.g. [b]chen_(cosplay)[/b] must have a [b]chen[/b] tag\r\n\r\nh6. Ask\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure whether a tag is right or wrong, then ask for help in topic #12251 (\"How do I tag this?\").\r\n\r\nh4. Tag categories\r\n\r\nThere are five types of tags: artist, character, copyright, general, and meta. Artist tags are red, characters are green, copyrights are purple, general tags are blue, and meta tags are orange.\r\n\r\nh6. Artist\r\n\r\nArtist tags identify the creator of a post. This doesn't mean the creator of the original copyrighted artwork. For example, you wouldn't use the [[Barasui]] tag on a picture of [[Matsuoka Miu]] drawn by [[Naruko Hanaharu]].\r\n\r\nArtist names should follow the guidelines in [[howto:romanize]]. Ask in topic #8199 (\"Artist tagging help\") if you need help creating an artist tag.\r\n\r\nh6. Character\r\n\r\nCharacter tags identify the characters in the post. Remember that Danbooru uses LastName_FirstName ordering.\r\n\r\nh6. Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright tags identify the anime, manga, game, or novel that the post is associated with. More generally, copyright tags identify the source material that the characters are from.\r\n\r\nCopyright tags should not be used for trademarks or brand names. A rule of thumb: if something doesn't have characters, it probably shouldn't be a copyright tag.\r\n\r\nh6. [[help:metatags|Meta]]\r\n\r\nMeta tags generally describe things beyond the content of the image itself. Examples include [[translated]], [[copyright request]], [[duplicate]], [[image sample]], and [[bad id]].\r\n\r\nh6. General\r\n\r\nGeneral tags are used for everything else. General tags should objectively describe the contents of the post. Don't use [[tag group:subjective|subjective tags]] which can be biased by personal preferences (e.g. [[cute]] or [[sexy]]), and don't tag things based on outside knowledge rather than what one can see in the post.\r\n\r\nh6#changing-tag-categories. Changing tag categories\r\n\r\nYou can change the category of the tag by prefixing it with [code]artist:[/code], [code]character:[/code], [code]copyright:[/code], [code]meta:[/code], or [code]general:[/code] when tagging a post. For example, tagging a post with [code]artist:sakura[/code] would change the [[sakura]] tag to an artist tag.\r\n\r\n [code]art:[/code], [code]char:[/code], [code]copy:[/code] are shortcuts for these prefixes.\r\n\r\nYou can also search the \"Tags\":[/tags] listing and use the \"edit\" link next to the tag to change its category.\r\n\r\nTags with between 50 and 1000 posts can only have their category changed by Builders. Category changes for above 1000 posts can be done by Admins, though any large changes should be discussed on the forum first. Make a \"bulk update request\":/bulk_update_requests/new to create a forum topic requesting that a tag category be changed.\r\n\r\nh4.

These problems forced the pair into a refit that saw their tall bridges, funnels, and masts lowered while one of their three triple torpedo mounts was removed.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the war, she was assigned with her sisters as Destroyer Division 21 and saw action in the Dutch East Indies and Aleutian campaigns, the latter was where she was sunk by a US submarine on 4 July 1942, with [[Inazuma (Kancolle)|]] rescuing her survivors.\r\n\r\nh4.

Because of this nickname, it's not uncommon to draw her with [[wolf ears]] and/or [[fangs]].\r\n\r\nA running gag portrays her as a \"Christmas Cake\"; a woman above 25 who for whatever reason is unable to find a candidate for marriage, a reference to her namesake mountain's association with the folk hero Kintaro, who was raised in Mount Ashigara by a Yama-uba: a mountain hag.

They tend to employ heavy emphasis of shadows in order to portray different emotions (which can be changed by angling the mask).\r\n\r\nMasks depicting human beings tend to reflect traditional medieval Japanese aesthetics (resembling characters from woodcut prints), having pale 'chubby' faces with well defined brows and cheek lines, plus prominent eyebrows. Masks depicting older humans tend to have extensive wrinkles and beards.\r\n\r\nMasks depicting supernatural entities tend to have large eyes and exaggerated expressions. They may also have horns, fangs and other nonhuman features. Gold paint is frequently used to (literally) highlight the otherworldly appearance of such entities.\r\n\r\nNoh masks are used to portray different characters when on stage, similar to Western makeup. An actor may, however, rapidly switch between different masks to fulfill different roles.\r\n\r\nh4.

The game was designed by Yotsui Kouichi, a.k.a. \"Isuke\":[http://strider.wikia.com/wiki/Isuke].\r\n\r\nIt became one of Capcom's early hits before [[Street Fighter II (series)|]], revered for its innovative gameplay, multilingual voice clips during cutscenes (presented in English, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Spanish) as well as its epic and diverse soundtrack (created by female video game composer \"Junko Tamiya\":http://capcom.wikia.com/wiki/Junko_Tamiya ).\r\n\r\nA [[Sega Mega Drive]]/Sega Genesis port of the  arcade version was released in 1990 and it quickly became one of the best selling and most critically acclaimed videogame adaptations for that system.\r\n\r\nA [[NES]] console version of the game was released in the United States only during 1989. This was an RPG, adventure and action adaptation with a plot and characters different from the arcade machine and more related to the Strider manga. \r\n\r\nThe manga based on the franchise was released in Japan a whole year before the game, illustrated and written by Tatsumi Wada, and serialized in the monthly magazine [i]Comic Computique[/i] from May to October 1988, spanning six issues. A single volume collection was later published on November 10, 1989. A short prequel story, titled [i]Strider Hiryu Gaiden[/i], was published following the completion of the main series and is not included in the collected edition.\r\n\r\nUnder license from Capcom USA, U.S. Gold and Tiertex produced a Strider video game sequel in Europe titled [i]Strider II[/i] (released in North America as [i]Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns[/i]) for various computer platforms, as well as the Mega Drive, Game Gear, and Master System. This European produced sequel was never released in Japan.\r\n\r\nAn unofficial \"spiritual\" sequel called [[Cannon Dancer]] was created in 1996 by [i]Isuke[/i]. \r\n\r\nCapcom later produced an official video game sequel, unrelated to the Tiertex produced Strider Returns and to Cannon Dancer, titled [i]Strider 2[/i].
