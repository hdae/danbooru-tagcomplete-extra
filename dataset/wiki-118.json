(NACA evolved into NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in 1958.) Although originally developed for aircraft, NACA ducts have appeared on a number of automobiles and motorcycles designed in the 1970s and 1980s. Notable examples of NACA-duct-equipped cars include the [[Ferrari F40]] and [[Lamborghini Countach]]. Some of these ducts were functional air intakes, but others were merely cosmetic--meant to convey an impression that the vehicles were high-tech and high-performance, like jet aircraft.\r\n\r\nAs an

He is the older brother of the Awataguchi school swords, due to the fact that he was the only tachi ever forged by Awataguchi.\r\n\r\nOriginally named \"Okatana Yoshimitsu\" (御刀吉光), Ichigo Hitofuri once belonged to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He ordered the blade to be shortened to match his rather short height. Ichigo Hitofuri was damaged in the summer of 1615 during the Siege of Osaka at Osaka Castle and then re-tempered by Yasutsugu under the order of Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, Ieyasu didn’t had the chance to use this sword because he was advised by the Priest Tenkai to avoid sending Hideyoshi’s swords (including Ichigo Hitofuri) to Edo. It has been an Imperial treasure since that time, alongside [[Tsurumaru Kuninaga]], [[Uguisumaru]] and [[Hirano Toushirou]].\r\n\r\nHe has [[short hair|short]] [[aqua hair]] and [[yellow eyes]]. He wears [[white gloves]] and a [[military uniform]] with [[necktie]].\r\n\r\nIchigo has a polite and humble personality and is shown to be concerned with his brothers' well-being. However, it seems that he keeps things to himself, such as the fact that he's worried about losing his identity (since he was retempered in the past) and is secretly displeased about the Saniwa having so many swords. \r\n\r\nFans enjoy portraying him as the big brother of the Awataguchi tantous, due to him being the biggest/tallest blade among Yoshimitsu's creations, not because he's the oldest among them. Either that, or he's presented as a foil to the prankster Tsurumaru.\r\n\r\nBecause of his in-game elder brother status, many of the swords tend to call him \"Ichi-nii\" (Big brother Ichi), which extends to his nickname outside the game as well.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["一期一振","つるいち","いちみか","一兄","いち兄"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159271,"created_at":"2023-02-22T09:17:18.002-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T09:17:18.002-05:00","title":"nakamura_sawa","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["仲村佐和"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159260,"created_at":"2023-02-22T07:56:50.357-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T07:56:50.357-05:00","title":"just_braven","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["JustBraven"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159257,"created_at":"2023-02-22T07:51:47.206-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T07:51:47.206-05:00","title":"dawn_(arknights)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["黎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159256,"created_at":"2023-02-22T06:55:09.863-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T06:55:09.863-05:00","title":"adelaide_bluthausen","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アデライーデ・ブルートハウゼン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":74465,"created_at":"2016-04-11T10:48:39.710-04:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T02:34:22.067-05:00","title":"shinano_toushirou","body":"A [[Touken Ranbu]] character.

The P-40 was tough, easy to fly and could outdive fighters six years newer and fifteen thousand dollars more expensive - strengths that were exploited by the famous \"Flying Tigers\", who exclusively flew P-40s. \r\n\r\nBut much more importantly the P-40 was culturally influential. Those Flying Tigers became an important propaganda tool for the United States, and the shark-teeth warpaint that adorned their P-40s had been copied an innumerable amount of times on any aircraft on any country- including, ironically, Japan.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["P-40"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":60946,"created_at":"2014-12-13T01:14:04.495-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-21T14:39:17.745-05:00","title":"j7w_shinden","body":"The [b]Kyushu J7W Shinden[/b] (震電, \"Magnificent Lightning\") was a land-based interceptor developed during [[World War II]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] to defend against bombing raids by the [[B-29 Superfortress]]. \r\n\r\nh4.
