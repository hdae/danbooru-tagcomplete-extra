He is the manifestation of [[Merem Solomon|Merem's]] wish to become others, the hope to transform, and he was designed after a friend of Merem who lived in the ceiling of his temple. He is a rat who is capable of transforming into anything that resembles the size and shape of a human, allowing him to act Merem's representative in human society under the guise of an elderly priest due to Merem being in the unaging form of a boy. It is his preferred persona despite his ability to transform into a myriad of people. He even acts as if he is Merem himself to all the other members of the Burial Agency besides [[Narbareck]] and Ciel because the organization values experience, with Merem believing that his true form would bring about unnecessary trouble. [[Ciel (Tsukihime)|]] calls the priest \"wise and cool\" compared to Merem's more childlike personality. If ever brought under the gaze of a high-class exorcist, his facade will be undone and cause him to return to its original form.\r\n\r\nDespite being intrinsically linked, they are not able to communicate telepathically. Should Merem leave the Left Arm behind with Narbareck, he must communicate with rats using his ability to speak to animals in order to relay messages. He is able to obtain information from them and relay messages to the Left Arm. They act reverently towards Merem, and consider the Left Arm to be the hero and idol of the rat world, thought of as the \"third most beautiful rat in the world.\" He is popular in communities in narrow spaces underground, on ceiling boards, in drainage conduits, and behind furniture. Despite his fame, they often point out the contradiction in his status by asking \"Just what part of you is a 'Great' Daemon Beast?\", leaving him troubled while apologetically trying to think of an answer, or not. He is a cheese lover who likes humans because of pizza, and works daily at a relaxed pace for the sake of Merem, humans, and rats.\r\n\r\nhttps://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Merem_Solomon","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":251694,"created_at":"2025-07-19T19:56:47.952-04:00","updated_at":"2025-07-19T19:56:47.952-04:00","title":"maggie_(sultan's_game)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["梅姬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":251692,"created_at":"2025-07-19T19:53:08.173-04:00","updated_at":"2025-07-19T19:55:41.176-04:00","title":"buried_in_sculpted_sand","body":"When a character is [[buried]] under a [[sand sculpture]].

What are artists?\r\n\r\nAn artist in Danbooru represents the person who created a piece of art. Danbooru's artist database tracks extra information about artists, including the websites they use and alternate names they're known under.\r\n\r\nh4. How do artist entries differ from tags?\r\n\r\nFor starters, artist entries list all websites or artist profiles that are associated with the artist. Danbooru uses these URLs to automatically identify the artist tag for new uploads, so it's very important to include this information.\r\n\r\nArtists can also have multiple \"other\" names associated with them. Typically this includes the artist's Japanese name. Notes allow one to list other extraneous details.\r\n\r\nArtist entries are also used to organize artists that are part of doujin circles. A circle is represented as an artist entry that has multiple group members.\r\n\r\nArtist entries do not have to have an associated tag to exist, nor does an artist tag have to have an artist entry when it is made, but it is recommend to make an artist entry for the artist tag as soon as possible, as to ensure that a given artist's work is concentrated in one entry and one tag specifically.\r\n\r\nh4. How to find an artist's name\r\n\r\nOn most art sites, the artist's name should be prominently displayed somewhere on their profile or alongside the post the art comes from. For smaller sites like an artist's home page or blog, information usually come in \"about\", \"profile\", \"info\", \"link\", \"プロファイル\", \"インフォ\", \"アバウト\", or \"管理人\" page. The artist's name may appear after \"PN\", \"HN\", \"管理人\", \"名前\", etc. Their circle or site name may appear after \"サイト名\" or \"HP\".\r\n\r\nMany Japanese artists will give their name in kanji, which may make it difficult to romanize. Sites like \"Tangorin\":[http://tangorin.com/names/] can offer assistance with this. If there are multiple readings given, try to see if there is a connection between one of them and the artist's pixiv or Twitter username, site name or link, or email address. If you can't figure it out, you can ask in topic #8199 and someone will be able to offer you help.\r\n\r\nIf the artist's name is in kana, you can romanize their name yourself using the tables on Wikipedia for \"hiragana\":[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana] or \"katakana\":[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana]. [[howto:romanize]] contains Danbooru's guidelines on romanization.\r\n\r\nIf the tag name you want to use already exists, you must qualify it with the artist's group name or handle from a site.\r\n\r\nh4. How do I search for artists?\r\n\r\nStart at the \"index\":/artists. In addition to browsing through the entire artist list, you can also search for artist by name or by URL.\r\n\r\nBy default, Danbooru will search across names, other names, and group names using exact string matching. You can do wildcard searching with \"*\". For example, searching for \"bol*\" will return any artist whose name starts with \"bol\".\r\n\r\nIf you only want to search the name field, prefix your query with [i]name:[/i] like [i]name:john.[/i] [i]group:[/i] and [i]other:[/i] work similarly.\r\n\r\nSuppose you know the artist's homepage, but can't figure out their name. Simply search for the URL (beginning with http) and Danbooru will return any associated artists.\r\n\r\nh4. Are artists tied to tags?\r\n\r\nNo. If you create an artist-typed tag, a corresponding artist is not automatically created. If you create an artist but no corresponding tag, searching for posts by that artist won't return any results.\r\n\r\nYou can think of the artist database as separate from the tags database.\r\n\r\nThis is an intentional design decision. By keeping the two separated, users have far more freedom when it comes to creating aliases, groups, and edits.\r\n\r\nh4. When I search for a URL, I get a bunch of unrelated results. What's going on?\r\n\r\nShort answer: this is just a side-effect of the way Danbooru searches URLs. Multiple results typically mean Danbooru couldn't find the artist.\r\n\r\nLong answer: when you're searching for a URL, typically it's a URL to an image on the artist's site. If this is a new image, querying this will obviously return no results.\r\n\r\nSo what Danbooru does is progressively chop off directories from the URL. http://site.com/a/b/c.jpg becomes http://site.com/a/b becomes http://site.com/a becomes http://site.com. It keeps doing this until a match is found. Danbooru does this more than once because there are cases where the URL is nested by date, like in http://site.com/2007/06/05/image.jpg. Usually this algorithm works very well, provided the artist has an entry in the database.\r\n\r\nIf they do not, then the algorithm is probably going to cut the URL down to just the domain, e.g. http://geocities.co.jp. When this happens, you'll sometimes get every artist hosted on that domain.\r\n\r\nWhy not just dump all the results if you get more than one? Well, there are a few cases when multiple artists validly map to the same domain. Usually the domain is just being used to host files or something.\r\n\r\nh4. Is there an API?\r\n\r\nYes. The artist controller uses the same interface as the rest of Danbooru. See the [[help:api|API documentation]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4. How to make an artist entry\r\n\r\nIdeally this should be done before you tag and post the art, as creating an artist entry will automatically create an associated artist tag and allows automatically fetching the artist from a source post. \r\n\r\nTo create an entry, you can either go to the \"new artist page\":[/artists/new] under the Artists tab at the top of the page, or from the upload page (The page where you're prompted to tag before clicking \"Post\") click the \"create new artist\" link under the Source tab. Using the link from the upload page will automatically populate the artist entry with an artist name, other names, and URLs, if the site is supported by Danbooru. The automatically populated artist name may not be ideal, so you are free to change it to a better name as determined by the previous section.\r\n\r\nFrom here, you'll see four fields. \r\n* [b]Name[/b] is self-explanatory.\r\n* [b]Other Names[/b] are for any miscellaneous names or identities the artist has, separated by spaces. These are generally what you should add in this field:\r\n\r\n** Names in kanji\r\n** Names in kana\r\n** Site name\r\n** Circle name\r\n** Pixiv nickname (Found under Pixiv avatar)\r\n** Pixiv username (Found in the Pixiv stacc feed URL)\r\n** Twitter name\r\n** Usernames or handles from any other site\r\n\r\n* [b]Group[/b] is usually the circle name. Only one group name is supported, as commas and spaces are considered part of the name. Unlike tag names, the group name supports any characters and thus you should use the original spelling and stylization of the name, including CJK characters, asterisks, and capitalization.\r\n\r\n* The [b]URLs[/b] field is a list of URLs associated with the artist, like their home page, their blog, and any servers that store the artist's images. Certain sites like Twitter, Patreon, or Fanbox have URLs that use displaynames instead of UIDs- If you are able to obtain the UID URLs, be sure to add them as well. Most UID URLs can be obtained by attempting to create a new artist via a post uploaded (But not posted) with no recognized artist associated with the source. Separate URLs with newlines or spaces.\r\n\r\nIf you've created a general (blue) tag by mistake, you have to change it to an artist tag before Danbooru will allow you to make an artist entry with that name. To do that, you can simply prefix the tag name with [code]art:[/code] or [code]artist:[/code] from the tag edit field on the post it's tagged on, or by finding it on the \"tags listing\":[/tags], clicking the triplet dot dropdown menu and clicking \"Edit\". Note that you should not do this for existing tags, only ones you have created as the wrong category by mistake.\r\n\r\nh4. Editing artist entries\r\n\r\nIf you want to supply additional URLs, Other names, or update the Group name- You can do so from the \"/posts/\":[/posts?tags=danboorubot] page, clicking \"Artist\" next to \"Posts\", and clicking \"Edit artist\", or by accessing the entry from \"/artists/\":[/artists/532525] and clicking \"Edit\" under the sub-tabs (Or \"Edit artist\" below the list of URLs).\r\n[b]Do not remove dead URLs.[/b] See topic #8048 for the many reasons why you should leave them alone. Instead, prefix the URL with a - to mark it as dead.\r\nIf you think the presently assigned name is unsuitable, consider going to the \"Artist alias request thread\":[/forum_topics/7713] and submitting an alias request. You can also manually edit the name of the artist entry under the Name field, [b]but it is preferred to alias[/b], as this will simultaneously update all tagged posts to the new name.\r\n\r\nh4. Wikis\r\n\r\nA wiki can exist for an artist, but must be created from \"the new Wiki page\":[/wiki_pages/new]. This is typically only reserved for important details such as requests not to merge with any alt artist entries, or if the entry is for a commissioner/reposter of some kind. Wikis for artists should not contain any of the URLs associated, to avoid any redundancy.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is currently marketed by Mattel.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players discard cards matching the color or number/symbol of the card on a discard pile. Certain action cards call the next color to play, reverse the direction of play, force the next player to draw a certain number of cards, or forfeit the next player's turn altogether. A player has to shout \"Uno\" (Spanish/Italian for \"one\") to warn other players they are down to their last card; a round ends when a player runs out of cards. In older rule sets, points are scored by adding values of the other players' cards and awarded to the player that ran out. For a quicker game, newer rule sets skip scoring and the player who runs out wins the round.\r\n\r\nOne popular house rule (not an official rule) is to counter a \"Draw 2/4\" card by playing a similar \"Draw 2/4\" card, thus \"stacking\" the number of cards the following player has to draw.\r\n\r\nh4.

The tagging criteria has been categorized by priority to bring attention to the more important tags. \r\n\r\nFor your easy reference, common tags, along with links to relevant tag groups have been provided.\r\n\r\nAs the checklist is quite long, please take it easy when familiarizing yourself with this list. Begin with the more important tags at Level 0 (and all sub-levels), and then work your way upwards.\r\n\r\nh6. About Tagging Priorities\r\n\r\nLower level tags are essential tags. Images lacking lower level tags are considered insufficient for efficient cataloging and searching.\r\n\r\nHigher level tags are extra tags which describe the more intricate details of an image, but are more difficult to apply correctly, usually due to potential for debate, or a higher requirement of knowledge of otherwise obscure topics such as memes.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Note to taggers:[/b] Some parts of this checklist may be incomplete. Feel free to help out with expanding the checklist, however, if any part of this list grows too large, please inform the forums about creating a tag group. Remember to reference this tagging checklist!\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Ignore, Do NOT Tag\r\n\r\n[b]Subjective tags[/b] that express opinions or subjective critique on images. Common examples are badass, cute, good, evil, moe, sexy and most other adjectives. A full list of known subjective tags may be found at [[Tag group:Subjective]].\r\n\r\n[b]Subjective themes,[/b] such as [i]misleading thumbnails[/i] or whether something is funny or sad, are also not to be tagged.\r\n\r\nThese are better done with Pools, or even multiple tags.\r\nFor a categorized, but by no means complete, list of pools, see [[pool groups]].\r\nThe Infamous \"Misleading Thumbnails\" Pool is at Pool #1229.\r\n\r\nh6. Examples\r\n\r\nSubjective tags and themes best left as pools.\r\n\r\n* Badass: Pool #1277\r\n* Disgustingly Adorable: Pool #903\r\n* Clever: Pool #330\r\n\r\nVery generic themes best left as multiple tags.\r\n\r\n* Blondes in Bikini {{blonde_hair bikini}}\r\n* Bloody Fighting: {{battle blood}}\r\n* Izayoi Sakuya in lingerie: {{izayoi_sakuya lingerie}}\r\n* Muscular Kirisame Marisa: {{kirisame_marisa muscular}}\r\n* Portraits of Hatsune Miku: {{portrait hatsune_miku}}, {{solo hatsune_miku}}\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that these searches are possible from a basic Member account, with a two-tag search limit, even if a little browsing may be required.\r\n\r\nh4#lv0. Level 0: Basic Identification\r\n\r\nAll posts MUST have these tags, if possible. These tags are responsible for making Danbooru minimally searchable, and allow [b]content filtering[/b] for viewers who do not like sexual content, or images with commonly blacklisted tags.\r\n\r\nh6. Identification\r\n\r\n* [b]Artist[/b] (prefix with artist: when creating a new tag)\r\n** If the artist does not currently have a tag on Danbooru, consider creating a new one. If you don't know how to read their name to create a tag, consider asking in the forum topic \"Artist tagging help\":/forum_topics/8199, where someone is likely to help you come up with a name for the tag.\r\n* [b]Copyright[/b] (prefix with copyright: when creating a new tag)\r\n* [b]Character[/b] (prefix with character: when creating a new tag) \r\n** Character lists from popular copyrights are available at [[tag groups]], in the Characters section.\r\n* [b]Source[/b]\r\n* [[original]]\r\n** Use this tag for illustrations that feature characters that are not related to any kind of copyright.\r\n** Frequently, these characters appear only in the one illustration, and will not have a name. In these cases, it isn't necessary to include character tags for them; the [[original]] tag is enough.\r\n** Sometimes, such a character may become recurring, limited to a single artist, or multiple artists on a very small scale. (In this case, they may have names. Most such named original characters can be found listed on the wiki page of the artist that created them.)\r\n\r\nh6. Classification\r\n\r\n* [b]Rating[/b]\r\n** See: [[howto:rate]]\r\n** (use the [b]Ratings[/b] choice list, or use {{rating:e}}, {{rating:q}}, {{rating:s}} or {{rating:g}}).\r\n* [[sexually suggestive]]\r\n** Note: [[sexually suggestive]] can carry a Sensitive rating.\r\n* [[Spoilers]] (Important: apply if image is a potential spoiler)\r\n[spoiler]Let's keep Danbooru a spoiler-free community.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nh6.
