He chose not to interfere in his master's conflict with ancient humans even after it resulted in the splitting of the Omnipotent into two conflicting and opposed sides; the god of the skies and the god of the stars. The sky god wished to recreate the sky realm while the Astral god opted to leave and create an entirely new world based on the one they had left, neither paying attention to the fate of the Speaker. Still, he continued to await contact from his master so he might continue fulfilling his role as Speaker. For thousands of years he took on the role of observer, watching over the two realms as they changed and evolved, acting only to deal with threats outwith the gods' powers.\r\n\r\nSensing an upcoming calamity that could befall the sky realm and wishing to protect the world his master created and its inhabitants, he decided to join the Singularity, the only known living human with the power to alter course of fate itself, assuming a new name to hide his true identity as a god's servant - Lucio.\r\n\r\nIn time the predicted calamity was revealed to have been set in motion by [[lucilius_(granblue_fantasy)|Lucilius]], who wished to bring an end to the entire sky realm. Initially Lucio tried to convince Lucilius to abandon his plan and his rebellion against gods, hoping to reach some common understanding as Lucilius was an Astral created in Lucio's image. But negotiations failed and Lucio was forced to feign being defeated by Lucilius, waiting inside the latter's core for the right moment to trap Lucilius in a space between dimensions which would serve as an eternal prison.\r\n\r\nAfter the calamity was halted and the visible threat was dealt with, he started to wonder if he still needed to perform his duties and if his master's wishes could really be good for this world. After all, it was not only the power of Supreme Primarch that saved the world but the combined strength of many different forces. He started to wonder if perhaps the world's current state was already perfect and no longer in need of evolution thanks to living creatures and their ability to support each other and compensate their own weaknesses. He confronted the Singularity with these mixed feelings in a dream. After reaffirming himself in his new stance, he left his role as observer and decided that it was fine to simply continue living on and to use his powers for the well-being of the skies. Aboard the Grandcypher alongside Singularity and their crew, he waits for the day when he can ask his master the true purpose behind himself, the world, and all living beings.

From that point on, fans began to draw the character closely resembling that original version.\r\n\r\nIn most versions she's portrayed as an entity akin to [[Bowser Jr.]]: a bratty younger version of her \"parent\". However, whether she's actually related to Eggman or not is usually up for interpretation; in some she's blood by cloning, by her being a niece, or some coupling, and in others she's an [[android]] powered by a jewel on her head. In any case, she is just as technologically proficient as her originator and antagonizes [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] as well.\r\n\r\nDo not mistake her for a younger genderswap of Dr. Eggman (see [[Eggma'am]] for a genderswap instead), nor a transformation in the vein of [[Super Crown]] fan characters (which often use the \"-ette\" suffix in English).\r\n\r\nh4.

Each post can have many [[help:tags|tags]], [[help:comments|comments]], [[help:notes|notes]], and a single [[help:artist commentary|artist commentary]]. Each post may also belong to multiple [[help:pools|pools]]. If you have an [[help:users|account]], you can also add a post to your [[help:favorites|favorites]] or [[help:favorite groups|favorite groups]].\r\n\r\nh4. Searching\r\n\r\nSearching for posts is straightforward. Simply enter the tags you want to search for, separating tags by spaces and words [i]within[/i] tags by underscores. For example, searching for {{blonde_hair blue_eyes}} will return every post that has both the [[blonde hair]] tag [b]and[/b] the [[blue eyes]] tag.\r\n\r\nBe aware that tags for characters and series are usually known by their original Japanese names, not their English names. For example, the tag on Danbooru for [i]The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya[/i] is [[Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]]. See [[help:tags]] for more information.\r\n\r\nDanbooru also offers many metatags that let you further refine your search. Metatags allow you to query on things like image width, height, score, uploader, upload date, and more. Consult the [[help:cheatsheet|cheat sheet]] for a complete list of what you can do.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that Members are limited to two tags per search. See [[help:users]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4. Tag List\r\n\r\nIn both the post listing page and on individual post pages you'll notice a list of tags with links next to them. Here's an explanation of what the links are:\r\n\r\n[b]?[/b]\r\n    This links to the wiki page for the tag. If the tag is an [[help:artists|artist]] type, then you'll be redirected to the artist page.\r\n\r\n[b]950[/b]\r\n    The number next to the tag represents how many posts there are. This isn't always the total number of posts for that tag. If you're searching for a combination of tags, this will be the number of posts that have the tag AND the current tag query. If you're not searching for anything, this will be the number of posts found within the last twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[b]Color[/b]\r\n    Some tag links may be colored green, purple, or red. Green means the tag represents a character. Purple means the tag represents a copyright (things like anime, manga, games, or novels). Red means the tag represents an [[help:artists|artist]].\r\n\r\nWhen you're not searching for a tag, by default the tag list will show the most popular tags within the last three days. When you are searching for tags, the tag list will show related tags, sorted by relevancy.\r\n\r\nh2#mode-menu. Mode Menu\r\n\r\n[[help:users|Gold and above users]] will notice a menu labeled \"Mode\" in the sidebar on the main listing page. This menu lets you make several changes without ever leaving the listing page. Simply select an option and whenever you click on a thumbnail, the action will be performed in the background.\r\n\r\n[b]View[/b]\r\n    This is the default mode. Whenever you click on a thumbnail, you'll go to that post.\r\n\r\n[b]Edit[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, an edit box will appear. Here you can easily change the post's tags from the listing page without opening the entire post.\r\n\r\n[b]Tag script[/b]\r\n    Write a tag script into the text box that appears, and it will be applied when you click on the thumbnail of a post. This allows you to quickly add or remove tags to many posts at once. See [[help:tag scripts]] for details on creating tag scripts.\r\n\r\n[b]Favorite[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, that post will be added to your list of [[help:favorites|favorites]].\r\n\r\n[b]Unfavorite[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, that post will be removed from your list of [[help:favorites|favorites]].\r\n\r\nh4. Borders\r\n\r\nIn the listing page, you will notice that some thumbnails have a border. The meaning of this border depends on the color.\r\n\r\n[b]Blue[/b]\r\n    The post is [[about:mod_queue|pending moderator approval]] or was [[about:mod_queue|flagged for deletion]].\r\n\r\n[b]Black[/b]\r\n    The post is [[about:mod_queue|deleted]].\r\n\r\n[b]Green[/b]\r\n    The post has [[help:post relationships|child posts]].\r\n\r\n[b]Yellow[/b]\r\n    The post has a [[help:post relationships|parent]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":13096,"created_at":"2009-07-26T20:47:42.532-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-25T12:27:32.480-05:00","title":"producer_(idolmaster)","body":"The Producer is the unseen player character of [[idolmaster|THE iDOLM@STER]] series.

In the latter case, they are usually referred to by the idol's name first, with Producer being shortened to just \"P\" (e.g. HarukaP, RankoP, and so on.).\r\n\r\nThis tag serves as both an umbrella tag for the character's various incarnations as well as the non-specific form from the games or fan materials. \r\n\r\nh4.

With subsequent acquisitions and divestments, Corus became the sole owner of the channel in 2014. The channel has historically aired a mix of domestic productions and imported series, with many of the latter coming from U.S. channel Cartoon Network. In 2012, Teletoon launched a Canadian version of Cartoon Network as a sister network under license from Turner Broadcasting. In February 2023, Corus announced that Teletoon would rebrand as Cartoon Network on March 27, 2023, with the previous Cartoon Network channel concurrently relaunching under Cartoon Network's own sister brand Boomerang. Cartoon Network operates two timeshift feeds running on Eastern and Pacific schedules.
