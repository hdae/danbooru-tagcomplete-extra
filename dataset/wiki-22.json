It is currently marketed by Mattel.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players discard cards matching the color or number/symbol of the card on a discard pile. Certain action cards call the next color to play, reverse the direction of play, force the next player to draw a certain number of cards, or forfeit the next player's turn altogether. A player has to shout \"Uno\" (Spanish/Italian for \"one\") to warn other players they are down to their last card; a round ends when a player runs out of cards. Points are scored by adding values of the other players' cards and awarded to the player that ran out.\r\n\r\nOne popular house rule (not an official rule) is to counter a \"Draw 2/4\" card by playing a similar \"Draw 2/4\" card, thus \"stacking\" the number of cards the following player has to draw.\r\n\r\nh4.

First released on the Sony [[PlayStation 1|PlayStation]] in 31 January 1997 (after a 3-year hiatus), and then re-released for personal computers in 1998.\r\n\r\nThe story is about Avalanche, an ecoterrorist organization combating the conglomerate Shinra Electric Power Company which is destroying the world's ecosystem by extracting mako for electricity. One of their latest recruits is acerbic mercenary [[Cloud Strife]], himself a former member of SOLDIER, Shinra's mako-enhanced supersoldier corps. Soon, however, Avalanche would face an even greater enemy in the form of [[Sephiroth]], another former SOLDIER intent on absorbing the planet's power and becoming a god.\r\n\r\nA remake, aptly titled [[Final Fantasy VII Remake]], was announced at Sony's 2015 E3 conference. The remake is a multi-game series, the first installment of which was released in April 2020. It would be followed up by [[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth]] in February 2024.\r\n\r\nh4.

There was also a \"Type D\" design that existed briefly after the original series, used in stage shows, originating from converting [[Zoffy (Ultra Series)|]]'s suit back into an Ultraman suit, as his suit was originally the Type A suit (previously also used by [[Imit Ultraman]], and would go on to be used for [[Ultraman Jack]]).

She works as the gatekeeper of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] and specializes in Chinese martial arts. Unusually for a Touhou character, it is unclear what kind of youkai Meiling is, but many fans associate her with [[dragon]]s. This is in part due to the star on her [[beret]], which bears the Chinese character for \"[[dragon]]\" (龍, [i]Long[/i]). Hong is also the name of a specific dragon from Chinese mythology, implying Meiling has some relation (such as parent and child), or actually is Hong, leading to frequent depictions [[Hong Meiling (dragon)|as a dragon]]. There are also occasional images that depict her [[Hong Meiling (panda)|as a panda]].\r\n\r\nFandom also often depicts Meiling as being lazy and ineffective at her job, and often being berated and/or [[knifed|punished]] for this by [[Izayoi Sakuya]]. In canon, however, her relationship with Sakuya is actually something closer to amicable co-workers, if not outright friendship, and she is generally very good at her job of repelling intruders, with the notable exception of [[Kirisame Marisa]], who everyone else at the mansion admits is impossible to keep out when she wants access to [[Voile]].\r\n\r\nSometimes known by her nickname \"China\" (中国, [i]Chuugoku[/i]), which originated on [[2channel]] during a debate about the proper reading of her name's kanji (some believed it to be the Japanese reading \"Kurenai Misuzu\", and it wasn't until later that [[ZUN]] revealed that the Chinese reading \"Hong Meiling\" is correct).
