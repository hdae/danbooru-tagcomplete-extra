She even goes so far as to speak her English lines in a native-sounding, vaguely British accent (largely thanks to her voice actress being born in Australia). Although Warspite speaks with a Western-sounding accent, actual sentences, such as \"Sally go!\" demonstrate grammar a native speaker would not use.\r\n\r\nWarspite behaves in the manner of a sedate, high-class British lady. She is often depicted in fanart alongside fellow English-speakers [[Iowa (kancolle)|]] and [[Kongou (Kancolle)|]]. She has hourly lines talking about Italian ships [[Littorio (kancolle)|]] and [[Roma (kancolle)|]], who she unsuccessfully tried to escort out of Italy following the Italian surrender, and [[Zara (kancolle)|]] and [[Pola (kancolle)|]], who she sank.\r\n\r\nThe historic HMS [i]Warspite[/i] was the Royal Navy's most decorated battleship, serving in both World War I and II.

All you need is a way to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to URLs. Responses are given in either XML or JSON format.\r\n\r\nh1. Testing\r\n\r\nAPI calls can be tested on https://testbooru.donmai.us. Scripts should be tested there before using them on the main site.\r\n\r\nh1. Basics\r\n\r\nHTTP defines four basic request methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. You'll be using these methods to interact with the Danbooru API. Most API calls that change the state of the database (like creating, updating, or deleting something) require an HTTP POST, PUT or DELETE call. API calls that only retrieve data can typically be done with an HTTP GET call.\r\n\r\nA URL is considered a resource and the HTTP methods are actions you perform on the resource. For example, GET \"/posts/23.json\":/posts/23.json returns a JSON representation of post #23. GET \"/posts/23.xml\":/posts/23.xml returns an XML representation. PUT or PATCH /posts/6.json would update the resource, for example changing its tags.\r\n\r\nSome resources require parameters. For example, you can find tags that start with the letter 'a' by calling GET \"/tags.json?search[name_matches]=a*\":/tags.json?search[name_matches]=a*. This will give you a JSON listing of all tags with names starting with an a.\r\n\r\nFor POST, PUT and DELETE requests you must pass these parameters along in the body instead of the query parameters. Body parameters may be encoded in one of two ways. The usual way is with key-values pairs using \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\":\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl -u \"$login:$api_key\" -X PUT \"https://testbooru.donmai.us/posts/6.json\" -d 'post[rating]=s&post[tag_string]=danboo'\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nParameters may also be encoded as JSON using \"Content-Type: application/json\":\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl -u \"$login:$api_key\" -X PUT \"https://testbooru.donmai.us/posts/6.json\" -d '{ \"post\": { \"rating\": \"s\", \"tag_string\": \"danboo\" } }' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh1. Responses\r\n\r\nAll API calls that change state will return a single element response (for XML calls). They are formatted like this:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<response success=\"false\" reason=\"duplicate\"/>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nFor JSON responses, they'll look like this:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n{ \"success\": false, \"reason\": \"duplicate\" }\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nWhile you can usually determine success or failure based on the response object, you can also figure out what happened based on the HTTP status code. In addition to the standard ones, Danbooru uses some custom status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range.\r\n\r\n* [b]200 OK[/b]: Request was successful\r\n* [b]204 No Content[/b]: Request was successful (returned by create actions)\r\n* [b]400 Bad Request[/b]: The given parameters could not be parsed\r\n* [b]401 Unauthorized[/b]: Authentication failed\r\n* [b]403 Forbidden[/b]: Access denied (see [[help:users]] for permissions information)\r\n* [b]404 Not Found[/b]: Not found\r\n* [b]410 Gone[/b]: Pagination limit (see [[help:users]] for pagination limits)\r\n* [b]420 Invalid Record[/b]: Record could not be saved\r\n* [b]422 Locked[/b]: The resource is locked and cannot be modified\r\n* [b]423 Already Exists[/b]: Resource already exists\r\n* [b]424 Invalid Parameters[/b]: The given parameters were invalid\r\n* [b]429 User Throttled[/b]: User is throttled, try again later (see [[help:users]] for API limits)\r\n* [b]500 Internal Server Error[/b]: A database timeout, or some unknown error occurred on the server\r\n* [b]502 Bad Gateway[/b]: Server cannot currently handle the request, try again later (returned during heavy load)\r\n* [b]503 Service Unavailable[/b]: Server cannot currently handle the request, try again later (returned during downbooru)\r\n\r\nh1. Authentication\r\n\r\nYou will need an API key if you need to login using the API. You can generate an API key by visiting your \"user profile\":/profile and clicking the Generate API key button.\r\n\r\nTo authenticate with the API, pass the [code]login[/code] and [code]api_key[/code] URL parameters, where [code]login[/code] is your username and [code]api_key[/code] is your API key:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nhttps://danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json?login=your_username&api_key=your_api_key\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nYou can also authenticate using \"HTTP Basic Authentication\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication]:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl \"https://$username:$api_key@danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json\"\r\ncurl --user \"$username:$api_key\" https://danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nMost HTTP libraries support HTTP basic authentication out of the box. If yours doesn't, you can generate the authentication header manually. The format is [code]Authentication: Basic $secret[/code] where [code]$secret = base64($username + \":\" + $api_key)[/code]. In other words, concatenate your username and API key together, separated by a colon, then \"Base64\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 encode the result:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl --header \"Authorization: Basic $(printf \"%s\" \"$username:$api_key\" | base64)\" https://danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nIf you are writing a user script for a browser, you do not need to embed an API key. You can rely on the user's session.\r\n\r\n⚠️ [b]IMPORTANT![/b] Keep your API key secret. Treat it like a password. Gaining access to it allows full access to your account. Do not publicly post your API key or distribute it in scripts.\r\n\r\nh1. Rate Limits\r\nThere's a global rate limit  on read requests of 10 requests per second regardless of account or endpoint.\r\n\r\nMost kinds of update actions are rate limited according to user level:\r\n\r\n* Basic users: 1 update/second\r\n* Gold users and above: 4 updates/second\r\n\r\nEach rate-limited endpoint has a burst pool, which lets a user make several consecutive updates before being rate limited. The rate at which the pool is recharged depends on the endpoint, but most follow the rates above.\r\n\r\nThe burst pool size, recharge rate, and current limits are returned as JSON in the [code]x-rate-limit[/code] HTTP header. They can also be found at \"/rate_limits\":[/rate_limits], which shows the limits as of the last API call (the page won't update until the API is used again).\r\n\r\nRate limits are shared between accounts and IP addresses: multiple accounts with the same IP address will share the same rate limit.\r\n\r\nh1. Queries\r\n\r\nh4. Common Search Parameters\r\n\r\nAll search endpoints support a common set of parameters:\r\n\r\n* [b]page[/b] Returns the given page. Subject to maximum page limits (see [[help:users]]).\r\n              You can also use [code]b<id>[/code] and [code]a<id>[/code] to request results before <id> or after <id>, respectively.\r\n              E.g. to get a page of posts before post #999999, you'd make a request to [code]/posts.json?page=b999999[/code].\r\n* [b]limit[/b] The number of results to return per page. The maximum limit is 200 for /posts.json and 1000 for everything else.\r\n* [b]search[id][/b]\r\n* [b]search[created_at][/b]\r\n* [b]search[updated_at][/b]\r\n* [b]search[order]=custom[/b] Returns results in the same order as given by [code]search[id]=3,2,1[/code].\r\n\r\nh5. Parameter Parsing\r\n\r\nNumeric search parameters support ranges:\r\n\r\n* [code]100[/code]\r\n* [code]>100[/code]\r\n* [code]>=100[/code]\r\n* [code]<100[/code]\r\n* [code]<=100[/code]\r\n* [code]100,200,300[/code]\r\n* [code]100..200[/code] (inclusive)\r\n\r\nDate parameters also support ranges:\r\n\r\n* [code]2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]>2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]>=2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]<2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]<=2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]2012-01-01,2012-01-02[/code]\r\n* [code]2012-01-01..2013-01-01[/code] (inclusive)\r\n\r\nBoolean parameters accept any of the following values for true or false:\r\n\r\n* True: true, t, yes, y, on, 1\r\n* False: false, f, no, n, off, 0\r\n\r\nMost string parameters support using asterisks ([code]*[/code]) as wildcards. Wildcards can be escaped with [code]\\*[/code]. Literal backslashes can be escaped with [code]\\\\[/code]. \r\n\r\nh1.

It was a third-generation console produced as a redesign and improvement of a previous console called the [[Sega SG-1000 II]]. It was capable of using regular [[game cartridge]]s as well as smaller-sized Sega Cards which held less memory, but quickly became unpopular in favor of cartridges.\r\n\r\nWhile having low sales in Japan and even less in the USA (and losing against the [[Nintendo]] [[Famicom]]/[[NES]] in those countries), the console proved extremely popular in Europe (with more than 6 million units purchased in the early 90s) and is still being sold in South America. \r\n\r\n[[Brazil]] is still the longest lasting market for the Master System. Tectoy, Sega's distributor in Brazil, is still responsible for marketing, sales and producing original games for it. Several different models of the console have been released in that country during the past decades. These are the Master System I, II, III (and a white colored relaunch version from the 2000s), the cordless Master System Compact, the pink Master System Girl, etc. All the existing [[Sega Game Gear]] games have been also ported to the system by Tectoy.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 and 2011, two variants of the Master System Evolution, a new console version successor to the Master System III that included 132 built-in games, were released only in Brazil. Another system called the Master System Portable which is a yellow gamepad with 30 built-in games has also been released recently by Tectoy.\r\n\r\nThe Sega Master System was succeded by the [[Sega Mega Drive]] in the early 80s.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[SEGA Light Phaser]]\r\n* [[List of game consoles]]\r\n* [[Tag Group:Video Game]]\r\n\r\nh4.External links\r\n\r\n* Wikipedia: \"Master System\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エスジー・セン","SG-1000"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50057,"created_at":"2013-11-03T21:32:24.244-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-15T22:10:28.590-05:00","title":"va-1ss","body":"A fictional transformable [[mecha]] from the [[MACROSS]] science fiction anime series. \r\n\r\nIt first appeared in the [[Macross 2]] OVA from 1992.\r\n\r\nThe [b]VA-1SS Metal Siren[/b] is an advanced and very powerful combat-capable prototype [[variable fighter]]. \r\n\r\nIt is armed with an experimental \"EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) anti-capital ship device\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse, missiles, and many energy weapons.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["VA-1SS"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30568,"created_at":"2011-11-30T13:03:07.851-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-15T21:27:55.154-05:00","title":"tag_group:artistic_license","body":"[See [[tag groups]].]\r\n\r\n[expand=Table of Contents]\r\n* 1. \"About\":#dtext-about\r\n* 2. \"Major changes\":#dtext-major\r\n* 3. \"Changes of the whole attire\":#dtext-whole_attire\r\n* 4. \"Changes of specific clothes or accessories\":#dtext-specific\r\n* 5. \"Changes of body parts other than hair and eyes\":#dtext-body\r\n* 6. \"Changes of hair\":#dtext-hair\r\n* 7. \"Changes of eyes\":#dtext-eyes\r\n* 8. \"Changes of personality and roles\":#dtext-pers_role\r\n* 9. \"Changes of overall colors\":#dtext-color\r\n* 10. \"Changes of age\":#dtext-age\r\n* 11. \"Other changes\":#dtext-other\r\n* 12. \"See also\":#dtext-see_also\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nThese are the possible changes fan artists make that differentiate their works from canon.\r\n\r\nh4#major.
