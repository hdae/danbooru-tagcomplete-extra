He wrote that pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in her honour during the month named after her: Ēosturmōnaþ (April), and that this became the English name for the Paschal season: Easter.\r\n\r\nThe Old High German name for April was the cognate Ôstarmânoth, which has led scholars to suggest there was a similar Continental Germanic goddess, *Ôstara. Their theory is supported by votive inscriptions dedicated to goddesses called the matronae Austriahenae, found in 1958 in Rhein-Erft-Kreis, Germany.

Some variants have her 'walk' by using her arms as legs, but she usually still makes that scratching noise.\r\n\r\nThe Teke-Teke's modus operandi is to ambush isolated victims at night to slice them in half across the torso (emulating her death).

You'll have to \"create an account\":[/users/new] if you don't have one already. In the [b]Blacklisted tags[/b] box, add the list of tags you want to hide.\r\n\r\nBlacklisted posts are hidden during searches. When posts are hidden, a Blacklist box will appear in the sidebar showing you how many posts were hidden. You can click the tags under the Blacklist section to toggle individual rules, or click the toggle at the top of the box to toggle all rules at once. You can choose to blur blacklisted posts rather than hiding them entirely by clicking the three dots on the Blacklist box, then selecting Blur images.\r\n\r\n[[help:safe mode|Safe mode]] is another option if you just want to hide non-{{rating:general}} posts.\r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\nEach rule goes on a separate line:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nyaoi\r\nfutanari\r\nguro\r\nspoilers\r\n[/code]\r\nThis will hide all posts that are tagged either [[yaoi]], [[futanari]], [[guro]], or [[spoilers]].\r\n\r\nIf you put multiple tags on one line, then only posts that have [b]all[/b] the tags will be hidden:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nyaoi guro\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nThis will only hide posts that are tagged both [[yaoi]] and [[guro]]. Posts that are tagged only [[yaoi]] or only [[guro]] will still be visible.\r\n\r\n[code]yaoi 2boys\r\n1boy[/code]\r\n\r\nThis will hide all posts that are tagged both tag [[yaoi]] and [[2boys]], also hide [[1boy]].\r\n\r\nh6. NOT operator\r\n\r\nThe [code]-[/code] symbol is the NOT operator. It lets you hide posts that [b]don't[/b] have certain tags.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nnude 1boy -1girl -multiple_girls\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nThis will hide all posts that are tagged [[nude]] and [[1boy]], but only if they don't have the tags [[1girl]] or [[multiple girls]].\r\n\r\nh6. OR operator\r\n\r\nThe [code]~[/code] symbol is the OR operator. It lets you hide posts that have [b]any[/b] of the given tags.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n~1boy ~2boys\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nis the same as:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n1boy\r\n2boys\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nThis can also be used to group together multiple complex rules into a single rule:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n1boy -1girl -multiple_girls\r\n2boys -1girl -multiple_girls\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nis the same as\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n~1boy ~2boys -1girl -multiple_girls\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh6. Metatags\r\n\r\nThere are a few special commands, known as metatags, that can be used to blacklist things other than regular tags:\r\n\r\n* {{rating:explicit}}\r\n* {{rating:questionable}}\r\n* {{rating:sensitive}}\r\n* {{rating:general}}\r\n* {{status:pending}}\r\n* {{status:flagged}}\r\n* {{status:deleted}}\r\n* {{score:<-5}} ([i]only less-than comparisons allowed[/i])\r\n* uploaderid:1234 ([i]must be a user id[/i])\r\n\r\nh6. Limitations\r\n\r\nWildcards are not allowed within blacklists. For example, using {{*boys}} to match the {{2boys}}, {{3boys}}, etc., tags won't work.\r\n\r\nh4. Default Blacklists\r\n\r\nThe following blacklist is automatically set for logged out users and new users:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nguro\r\nscat\r\nfurry -rating:g\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh4.

The movie follows a group of survivors who are trapped in a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania after the dead rise back to life as [[zombie]]s (called [[ghoul]]s in the movie) and attack the living.\r\n\r\nDespite the movie's controversy due to its gore and violence at the time, the movie was a hit in the box office and praised by critics due to the movie's criticism of America's society in the 1960s and racism. It also lead to the popularity of zombies in entertainment media. \r\n\r\nAs a result of titling error where the movie was never properly copyrighted, the movie is available in the public domain free of use, which resulted in several unofficial sequels and remakes. \r\n\r\nThe movie had two official sequels by Romero, [[Dawn of the Dead]], in 1978, which later had a remake by [[Zack Snyder]] in 2004 and [b]Day of the Dead[/b] in 1985, which also had a remake for DVD in 2008. An official remake of the 1968 movie titled, [i]George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead[/i] was released in 1990, based on a rewritten script of the original movie by Romero. While the movie's plot is still similar to the original, the remake not only had a bigger budget including being filmed in color, it also includes an expanded role for some characters including a new ending.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ナイト・オブ・ザ・リビングデッド"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":246074,"created_at":"2025-06-06T23:24:49.581-04:00","updated_at":"2025-07-03T09:00:07.335-04:00","title":"japanese_spitz","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["日本スピッツ","spitz"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123320,"created_at":"2021-04-14T13:12:23.185-04:00","updated_at":"2025-07-03T08:59:46.421-04:00","title":"samoyed_(dog)","body":"A Siberian breed of medium-sized white- or cream-colored sled [[dog|dogs]].\r\n\r\n[[Fate/Grand Order]]'s [[Keno (fate)|]] is a Samoyed.

Ægir is attested as married to a goddess, Rán, who also personifies the sea, and together the two produced daughters who personify waves, the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán, and Ægir's son is Snær, personified snow. Ægir may also be the father of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, wife of the god Freyr, or these may be two separate figures who share the same name (see below and Gymir (father of Gerðr)).\r\n\r\nOne of Ægir's names, Hlér, is the namesake of the island Læsø (Old Norse Hlésey 'Hlér's island') and perhaps also Lejre in Denmark.

The games usually feature simple plots; the most common theme is that of Bowser, the primary antagonist, kidnapping Princess Peach, whom Mario saves.\r\n\r\nDespite the plots usually being very simple, the Mario role-playing games tend to have deeper plots, often involving enemies other than Bowser (many of which involve Bowser actually teaming up with Mario), with aspirations for world domination. Mario and friends have been featured in 200 games, and the series has sold over 200 million copies total, making it the best-selling video game series of all time.\r\n\r\nh4. Characters\r\n\r\nh6.

As the story continues the new enemy Stands are named after Egyptian gods (such as [[Anubis (stand)|]] and [[Horus (stand)|]]). Near the end some Stands are named after western music groups (such as [[Cream (stand)|]]).\r\n\r\nFrom Part 4 onwards, the vast majority of the Stands' names are named after various western music groups, albums, and songs (such as [[Killer Queen]], [[Aerosmith (stand)|]], [[Foo Fighters (jojo)|]], and [[20th Century Boy (Stand)|]]).\r\n\r\nAlthough usually featured with their \"Stand User\", it is not uncommon for Stands to be featured by themselves or with other people in fanart.
