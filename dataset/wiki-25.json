During the latter of which, [i]Hatakaze[/i] participated in the \"Battle of Sunda Straight\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sunda_Strait], performing a torpedo attack against ABDA cruisers.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, 1943, [i]Hatakaze[/i] suffered an accidental explosion, and was forced to receive repairs for over a year, emerging in October of the following year. Following the dissolution of Destroyer Division 5, she was put directly into the Combined Fleet.

At the time of The Battle of Pearl Harbor, she was assigned to Destroyer Division 5 (alongside sister-ships [[Harukaze (kancolle)|]] and [[Asakaze (kancolle)|]]). As one of the more obsolete classes of destroyers, her early-war career was spent escorting troop transports for invasions, although in the Battle of Sunda Straight, she helped sink an auxiliary minesweeper.\r\n\r\nThroughout the middle of the war (1943-1944), [i]Matsukaze[/i] was engaged in \"Tokyo Express\" expeditions. [i]Matsukaze[/i] was at Truk during Operation Hailstone, but survived with no direct hits from major ordinance.

History\r\nThe historic HMS [i]Ark Royal[/i] was built under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, which significantly limited her displacement, and was the reason she was not built an armored aircraft carrier as subsequent British carriers were.  \r\n\r\nHMS [i]Ark Royal[/i] was originally assigned to \"hunter-killer\" groups, focused upon hunting down and destroying German U-boats that were wreaking havoc upon Allied shipping across the Atlantic. Following the French surrender, [i]Ark Royal[/i] was part of the group that went to negotiate the surrender of the French battleships, and when the French admiralty refused, initiated attacks against the French battleships, incapacitating the [i]Dunkerque[/i], although the [i]Strasbourg[/i] escaped.  \r\n\r\nIn perhaps her most famous engagement, during May of 1941 [i]Ark Royal[/i] was instrumental in sinking the German battleship [[Bismarck (Kancolle)|]], both in finding her after British battleships lost track of her, and also when one of her Fairey Swordfish crippled the [i]Bismarck[/i], after which it was finished off by multiple Royal Navy battleships. \r\n\r\n[i]Ark Royal[/i] was finally sunk on 13 November 1941 from torpedoes that were launched by German submarine [[U-81 (Azur Lane)|]]. Inquiries were made regarding her sinking, as many attempts were made to save her from her fate. This inquiry concluded that design flaws due to treaty restrictions led to [i]Ark Royal[/i]'s sinking, which were rectified in later carriers built by the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nh4.

Several of her in-game lines also paint her as someone who wistfully longs for peace, a reference to both the fact that she, as a training vessel, isn't much of a warrior and lacks any confidence in her combat ability, and the fact that the historic ship was commissioned during the peace before the war, engaged in essentially no combat the whole duration of the war, and was used as a repatriation vessel after the war before being scrapped in Japan. (Personality-wise, this makes her similar to [[inazuma (kancolle)|Inazuma]].)  Her in-game lines portray her as lacking in self-confidence and happiest when cooking or brewing coffee for others. Unlike Katori, she's generally shown as a gentle girl who shows her admiral kindness if not affection, making her particularly popular. This has sometimes resulted in a particularly lustful/lewd image, partially from all the doujins she's recieved as as result of her popularity.\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\nKashima has [[blue eyes|bluish]]-[[grey eyes]] with a [[tsurime]] style, and [[wavy_hair|wavy]] [[grey hair]] tied into [[twintails]], with [[sidelocks]] in the front. She also has [[large breasts]].\r\n\r\nSimilar to her sister-ship, she wears a [[white jacket|white]] [[long sleeves|long-sleeved]] [[double-breasted]] [[military jacket]] with black [[buttons]] and trim, along with gold [[epaulettes]] and a [[red neckerchief]].  She wears [[white gloves]], has a [[pleated skirt|pleated]] charcoal/[[black skirt|black]] [[miniskirt]], [[black_socks|black]] [[kneehighs]], and sandal-like shoes.  She wears a [[black headwear|black]] [[beret]] with two flag-like flaps of cloth accentuating it. These flags appear to be the signal flags Uniform and Yankee. When flown together these mean \"I am carrying out exercises. Please keep clear of me\", referring to Kashima's status as a training cruiser. When damaged, it appears she wears [[no bra]] and [[no panties]].\r\n\r\nKashima's [[machinery|combat gear]] involves a large pair of [[binoculars]], her depth charge launcher carried like a briefcase, her bridge carried on a strap like a purse, and a back-mounted weapons platform with twin [[searchlight|searchlights]], and a large and small pair of twin-[[cannon]] [[ship turret|turrets]].\r\n\r\nFor Christmas 2015, she was given a red knit sweater with fur trimming, a Christmas [[capelet]] and a Christmassy version of her hat. She is seen holding a popper.\r\n\r\nFor a campaign with [i][[Lawson]][/i] in February 2016, she was designated, along with Katori, to wear the Lawson uniform.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nHistorically, the IJN [i]Kashima[/i] was designated for front-line duty, leading landings or being a flagship for fleet action, during the earlier parts of the war, but never actually saw combat, before being sent back to resume its intended role as a training ship.  As a training ship, she was notably a much slower ship, and not as particularly well-armed as most other light cruisers. During the last year of the war, however, the desperate Japanese pressed her into service as a transport and as an anti-submarine patrol ship.  During this time, she collided with and sank a transport ship, [i]Daishin Maru[/i], marking the only kill of her career. She survived the war, was used as a repatriation vessel, and was kept by the Japanese, eventually being broken up for scrap.\r\n\r\nh4.

This seasonal CG, a Christmas-themed one, shows her wearing a [[red dress]] with a [[corset]], a [[white skirt|white]] pleated skirt, a [[white capelet]], [[black gloves|black]] [[fingerless gloves]], a [[holly hair ornament]], black thighhighs, and [[fur-trimmed_boots|fur-trimmed]] [[black footwear|black]] [[boots]].

Her [[official art|(official) art]] style has her looking quite cold and nearly monochrome, most likely to reflect on her historic counterpart's noncompletion. She is frequently seen in the company of the other German ships, especially [[bismarck (kancolle)|Bismarck]] and [[prinz eugen (kancolle)|Prinz Eugen]], and occasionally as having a senpai-kouhai relationship with [[Akagi (kancolle)|Akagi]], from whom some of her flight deck design was copied.

Unlike Japanese carriers, she carries no historical weapon representing aircraft launching, instead holding a small deck of two twin-[[cannon]] anti-air [[ship turret|turrets]] like a pistol. Her hull also has twin-cannon turrets. Her carrier deck is carried on a robotic swing arm from the back of the hull that is attached to her back on a metal girdle.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nThe historic Graf Zeppelin was also notable for incorporating design flaws the other major powers had already learned to avoid. Graf Zeppelin's surface armament was 16 single-purpose 15 cm guns in 8 twin-mount casemates, at a time when other countries were arming their carriers with smaller dual-purpose guns to increase their anti-air coverage. These guns were of heavy cruiser size, numbered more than a heavy cruiser would carry for \"commerce raiding operations\" and would have required the carrier to come into direct surface engagement range to actually use. This was in fact the result of miscommunication with the ship's designer, who intended to save weight by using 4 twin-mount instead of 8 single-mount casemates; the builders thought that he was instead telling them to double the total number of guns. In game, though, this trait is the reason she's able to attack during night battles, the first night carrier in the game (though not night airstrike combat-capable).\r\n\r\nh4.

She participated in a number of fleet exercises in the inter-war years, and also briefly served in various tasks such as becoming a training ship, and even assisting in the search for Amelia Earhart. During WWII, [i]Colorado[/i] saw extensive action throughout the Pacific against the Japanese, being a constant presence in pre-invasion shelling and fire support actions from Tarawa all the way to Okinawa. For her service, the battleship was awarded seven battle stars. After the war, she participated in \"Operation Magic Carpet\" to bring US troops back home. She was decommissioned in 1947 and sold for scrap in 1959.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nShe is named after the state of Colorado, the second such ship in the US Navy but the third to carry the name (the first USS [i]Colorado[/i], a steam screw frigate, was named after the Colorado River).\r\n\r\nShe is the first foreign shipgirl as well as the first personified battleship for her artist [[Parsley-f]]. She is also the fourth (second foreign) member of the so-called Big 7 (the seven battleships with 16-inch guns built before WWII) in the game, joining [[nagato (kancolle)|Nagato]], [[mutsu (kancolle)|Mutsu]], and [[nelson (kancolle)|Nelson]].\r\n\r\nIn comparison to the other Big 7 in the game, she is given a petite body and a more youthful appearance, reflecting the fact the Colorado-class battleships were the shortest of the Big 7 at 624 feet 3 inches (190.27 m) each, compared to the Nagato-class at 708 feet (215.8 m; later lengthened to 738 feet/224.94 m) each and the Nelson-class at 710 feet (216.4 m) each.

Her namesake (and namesake of the class) is Navy Admiral \"Frank Friday Fletcher (1855-1928)\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Friday_Fletcher], who served in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably as commander of naval forces at the \"Battle of Veracruz\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Veracruz] in Mexico. She is designed by [[Zeco]], who also illustrated the first of her class in the game, [[johnston (kancolle)|Johnston]].\r\n\r\nThe Fletcher class was the most numerous of the destroyers that participated in World War II, built completely free from any treaty restrictions with a larger size, larger fuel capacity and range, and better armaments. In the world of Kantai Collection, this translates to Fletcher and Johnston being tall and having ample bustlines; among the other non-Japanese destroyers before them, only [[tashkent (kancolle)|Tashkent]] is comparable in those areas while the others are implied to have flat chests.\r\n\r\nBeing the nameship of the class, Fletcher herself is given traits of [[long_hair|long]] [[blonde hair]] with triangular [[double_bun|side buns]], [[purple eyes]], and a [[large_breasts|very well-endowed]] body. Her outfit is similar to Johnston's but with the black features being given lighter colors: a stylized [[serafuku]] which consists of an [[off shoulder|off-shoulder]] [[blue shirt]] with a [[white sailor collar]] that exposes her [[cleavage]], a [[yellow neckerchief]], and a short [[white skirt|white]] [[pleated skirt]], along with [[white legwear|white]] [[thighhighs]] that are shielded by what seem to be metallic thigh and [[shin guards]] and red [[rudder footwear|rudder shoes]]. She also wears [[white gloves|white short gloves]] and a metallic [[hairband]]. In her [[remodel (kantai_collection)|remodeled form]], she adds a [[star hair ornament]] to each side of her hairband.\r\n\r\nHer [[machinery]] consists of two [[smokestack]]s and two 5-inch [[cannon]] [[ship turret]]s with one set on each side of her rigging. Her hull number is emblazoned on each side of her lower rigs. She also carries a [[cargo net]], a reference to her rescuing many survivors of the USS [i][[Northampton_(kancolle)|]][/i] during the \"Battle of Tassafaronga\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tassafaronga] by using cork-floated cargo nets.\r\n\r\nFor her remodels see the respective tags:\r\n* [[Fletcher Kai (kancolle)|]]\r\n* [[Fletcher Mk II (kancolle)|]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of her lines, she refers to herself as \"Lucky 13,\" a historical nickname developed by the historal crew. This stems from the great luck they received despite multiple instances of the number. She survived the events of November 13, 1942 (a Friday to boot) during the \"Naval Battle of Guadalcanal\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal] unharmed while being the 13th out of a line of 13 ships, with three torpedoes missing her hull. The digits of her hull number add up to 13; the same can be said of Task Force 67, of which she was a member.\r\n\r\nFletcher is one of the US Navy's most decorated ships during World War II, earning 15 battle stars for her service in the Pacific. She would later earn another five battle stars for service in the Korean War. Fletcher was decommissioned twice, first in 1947 before being reactivated in 1949 and then again in 1969, ending up being scrapped the same year.\r\n\r\nOf her 174 class sisters, 19 (including Johnston) were lost in battle, six were heavily damaged and never repaired, and the rest had varying degrees of success in World War II and beyond with several being transferred to other navies (including 11 to the modern Italian Navy, the West German Bundesmarine, and the [[japan_maritime_self-defense_force|JMSDF]]). Four still survive to this day as museum ships (The Sullivans, Charrette/Velos, Kidd, and Cassin Young) with a fifth (John Rodgers/Cuitláhuac) serving until 2001 before being scrapped in 2006.\r\n\r\nh4.

Appearance\r\n\r\nSimilar to [[kamikaze (kancolle)|Kamikaze]], Asakaze wears a [[Meiji schoolgirl uniform]] with a white [[furisode]] top, including a gradient to blue in the loose sleeves, along with a cobalt blue [[hakama skirt]] tied with a sash bearing an [[anchor]] on the end, and [[knee_boots|knee-high]] [[lace-up boots]]. She has [[blue eyes]] and [[long_hair|long]], [[wavy_hair|wavy]] [[light brown hair]] with [[parted_bangs|her bangs parted in the middle]] providing long [[sidelocks]] and exposing her [[forehead]]. She also wears two large blue [[hair_ribbon|hair ribbons]] on either side of her head.\r\n\r\nHer [[machinery|rigging]] includes a [[smokestack|funnel]] attached to her back with an adjoining mast and twin-tube [[torpedo]] launcher. To her sides, at thigh-level, are cutoff-ship-deck-like platforms that bear a single-[[cannon]] [[ship turret|turret]]. She also carries a single-cannon turret in her left hand like a pistol, which is modeled like a ship's bow bearing the number \"5\". \r\n\r\nh4. Personality\r\n\r\nAsakaze has an energetic personality, proud of her accomplishments but also highly sensitive to criticism. Her in-game lines include several instances of indignation over perceptions of anyone \"making fun of her\" even when none existed. Possibly because of the meaning her name, she also seems to love mornings, getting up at 4 AM to see the sunrise. Inversely, she becomes notably more nervous at night, likely due to the circumstances of her sinking.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nOriginally commissioned merely as \"Destroyer No. 3\" as part of the \"8-8 Fleet Program,\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-eight_fleet the name [i]Asakaze[/i] was only assigned in 1928, five years after launch. At the time of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, [i]Asakaze[/i] was part of Destroyer Division 5, alongside sister-ships [i][[harukaze (kancolle)|Harukaze]][/i], [i]Matsukaze[/i], and [i]Hatakaze[/i].\r\n\r\nAlready aging by the start of the war, Asakaze mostly escorted landing craft in campaigns like \"the Philippines\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_Campaign_(1941%E2%80%9342)], \"Java\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Java], and \"Andaman Islands\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_and_occupation_of_the_Andaman_Islands_during_World_War_II]. At the \"Battle of Sunda Straight\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sunda_Strait], [i]Asakaze[/i] launched torpedoes that assisted in the sinking of HMAS [i]Perth[/i] and USS [i]Houston[/i].\r\n\r\nThroughout most of the rest of the war, she was a convoy escort ship. [i]Asakaze[/i] was torpedoed by the submarine USS [i]Haddo[/i] at 22:35 on August 23rd near Luzon while on escort duty. During the night, efforts to save her proved unsuccessful, and in the pre-dawn hours of August 24th, she capsized and sank. \r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nAlthough she was the second of the nine Kamikaze-class destroyers, due to IJN numbering at the time she was listed as \"Destroyer No. 3\" at launch due to sharing a number scheme with the \"Wakatake-class destroyers\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakatake-class_destroyer].\r\n\r\nHer seiyuu is [[Itou Shizuka]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Thunder...!! Thunder...!!! THUNDERCATS....!!!! HOOOOOOO.....!!!!![/i] - Lion-O, Lord of the ThunderCats.\r\n\r\n[i][b]ThunderCats[/b][/i] is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[Furry]] animated television series that was produced by Rankin/Bass Productions debuting in 1985, based on the characters created by Tobin \"Ted\" Wolf. It was originally intended as an attempt to profit from the success of previous similar shows like [[Masters of the Universe]].\r\n\r\nThe series follows the adventures of a group of catlike humanoid aliens with super powers. \r\n\r\nThe cartoon, for which Leonard Starr was the head writer, became extremely popular and lasted 4 seasons. The animation for the episodes is notable because it actually was provided by the Japanese studio Pacific Animation Corporation, later acquired in 1989 to form Walt Disney Animation Japan. Thus the animation was made in an 80s anime style.\r\n\r\nThe series was originally distributed by Rankin-Bass Productions' then-parent company Telepictures Corporation, which would later merge with Lorimar Productions in 1986. In 1989 Lorimar-Telepictures was purchased by Warner Bros, who has owned the rights for the series since then.\r\n\r\nThere were also several comic book series produced: A [[Marvel]] Comics' version (currently owned by Warner Bros. rival Disney), 1984 to 1988; and five series by Wildstorm, an imprint of DC Comics (Warner Bros.' corporate sibling), beginning in 2003. Items of clothing featuring the ThunderCats logo and DVD boxsets of the original series have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years as nostalgia for the former children's favorite has grown.\r\n\r\nA remake of the original ThunderCats animated series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and began airing on Cartoon Network from July 2011. Animation production was being done by Japanese animation company Studio 4°C. Despite an early positive response the new series was cancelled after only one season because of low ratings.\r\n\r\nh4.

Danbooru New Lurkers Guide\r\n\r\nGreetings, Lurker! You have just entered one of the most comprehensively indexed and moderated repositories for anime-related art on the internet. In the next hour or so, you will learn how to take advantage of Danbooru's viewing and searching capabilities.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]\"READ THE RULES BEFORE PROCEEDING\":/static/terms_of_service [/b]\r\n\r\nThis includes the [[help:upload rules|Upload Rules]], the [[help:community rules|Community Rules]], and the \"Terms of Service\":/static/terms_of_service. All users are obliged to follow these rules for everyone's benefit.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Stay With the Tour Guide![/b]\r\n\r\nPlease note that this guide only covers searching and browsing on Danbooru. You will sooner, later or already find that you can post things in here.\r\n\r\nPosting anything here (this includes comments and forum messages) is regarded as contributing, and we strongly recommend that you read the [[howto:contribute|Lurker's Transformation Guide (on Becoming a Contributor)]] before posting.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Don't need any introduction?[/b]\r\n\r\nYou would be good enough to use Danbooru without reading any further by now if you have used \"similar sites\":https://gelbooru.com, but you are welcome to come back to this guide if you need to. [[help:cheatsheet|Search techniques]] such as use of metatags are largely identical, but Danbooru may use different tag names and impose additional restrictions.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. How Danbooru Works\r\n\r\nh6. Anatomy of Danbooru\r\n\r\nHere's how we organize our content:\r\n* Danbooru hosts a collection of images called [b]Posts[/b], and each Post is an uploaded file. Pictures and [[animated|animations]] are supported. Supported formats are JPEG, PNG (including [[Animated PNG]]), GIF, SWF, and WEBM.\r\n* Posts are described by [b]Tags[/b]. Our Tags are highly reused and deduplicated keywords used to identify the visual content, subject matter, composition or other information about a Post.\r\n* [b]Pools[/b] are sub collections of Posts. They are used to keep Posts organized when Tags are not sufficient or ideal.\r\n* Posts can also be annotated by [b]Notes[/b]. These notes are laid over the Post and contain text information. Notes can be hidden and revealed by clicking or tapping the Post.\r\n* We have a special kind of [b]Artist[/b] Tag, simply called Artist for short. Artist are for identifying the original artists of a Post, and are a little different from other tags by having a specially formatted Wiki specially for artist information.\r\n* Finally, we have [b]Wiki[/b] Pages, or just Wikis for short, which are single pages of text information to accompany Tags and Artists. Each Tag has a corresponding Wiki of the same name.\r\n\r\nh6. Lingo\r\n\r\nSee our [[help:glossary|Glossary Help page]].\r\n\r\nh4. Viewing Posts and Notes\r\n\r\nh6. Posts\r\n\r\nYou may be already familiar with the Post listing view, as it is the first thing you saw when you first visited this site. A list of Post thumbnails will be presented to you. Clicking (or tapping) a thumbnail in the listing lets you see the Post in all its glory, along with its details and comments. There is also a search feature you can enter keywords into to find Posts of things you desire, but more on that later.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't yet done so, now is a good time to get to know Danbooru's \"keyboard shortcuts\":/static/keyboard_shortcuts, if you are browsing from a regular PC with a keyboard.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Protip![/b]\r\n\r\nPressing [b]Tab[/b] at least once gets you out of the search box if you want to cancel your search and continue browsing. You can now continue using the other shortcut keys.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh6. Post Color Codes\r\n\r\nWhile browsing Danbooru in the Post listing view, you may notice that some thumbnails will have a brightly colored border. These are color codes representing the status of a Post, or the presence of strongly related Posts.\r\n\r\n* [b]Green[/b] and [b]Yellow[/b] Posts have been linked to related posts. These are shown in the Post's detail view as thumbnails near the top. (Try it: search {{parent:any}})\r\n* [b]Blue[/b] Posts are still being reviewed by Moderators, and will be deleted if it doesn't gain any Moderator approval. (Try it: search {{status:pending}})\r\n* [b]Red[/b] Posts have been flagged for deletion by another user, usually due to policy violations or quality issues. View the Post to find out the reason it was flagged. (Try it: search {{status:flagged}})\r\n\r\nPosts may have more than one color code at once. The color codes are taken from the [[help:posts|Posts help wiki]]. Please be aware that this approach is not without its limitations. There are pictures out there with [[border|borders]] as a compositional element that happen to be [[red_border|red]], [[green_border|green]], [[blue_border|blue]] or [[yellow_border|yellow]].\r\n\r\nh6. Hot and Popular\r\n\r\nIf you want to see only the best of the best, there are two alternate Post listing views you can use.\r\n\r\n* [b]Hot[/b] lists the highest-scoring, latest Posts. Only posts from the last two days are shown. Posts are generally ordered newest first, but older Posts with a high-enough score may be shown before newer ones.\r\n* [b]Popular[/b] lists the highest-scoring Posts on a chosen day, week or month, ordered strictly by score. Choose from the available options to [[steins;gate|travel back and forth in time]].\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Curious?[/b]\r\n\r\nFor the geeky and curious at heart, you can check out the exact algorithm behind the Hot Listing in the Danbooru's source code, at the bottom of \"this file\":https://github.com/r888888888/danbooru/blob/master/app/logical/post_query_builder.rb. See also forum #89137\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh6. Notes & Translations\r\n\r\nOn some Posts you will notice translucent rectangles laid over the image. These are Notes, and hovering the mouse cursor over the white reveals the hidden information contained within.\r\n\r\nNotes may be used to insert Translations without modifying the original post:\r\n* Japanese [[4koma]] (yonkoma) translated to English: post #502527\r\n* More Japanese [[comic]] translated English: post #280703 \r\n* Long Japanese manga translated to English: post #691933 \r\n* [[finnish_text|Finnish]] manga translated to English: post #1034157\r\n\r\nNotes may also serve as labels:\r\n* Large and Labelled Post: post #816844 \r\n* Challenging Notes Exercise (small and hidden hover zones): post #889765 \r\n\r\nNotes can be hidden by clicking or tapping on the image area in the Post. Repeatedly hiding and showing Notes may reveal hidden easter eggs.\r\n\r\nh6. Tags\r\n\r\nTags are highly reused keywords and search terms that identify things that appear in a Post, making it easy to search images by text. For example, searching for witches and  apples (search: {{witch apple}}) returns Posts in which at least one witch and at least one apple appears.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]More on that later...[/b]\r\n\r\nTag use and searching are described in greater detail in the section Searching Posts below.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nEvery Post will be indexed by a list of Tags that appear on the left side of the Post view. Get familiar with how they work by paying attention to the Tags used when viewing a post. If there's a visual or semantic element in a picture, it's got to have a name!\r\n\r\nTag Viewing Exercises\r\n\r\n* Simple Solo Portrait (post #375036)\r\n* Fantasy Action Shot (post #900072)\r\n* Sensual Multi Large Format Portrait (post #687765)\r\n* Manga Style Parody (post #148472)\r\n* Touhou Project Cast Ensemble (post #459981)\r\n\r\nStudy the Post's tags, and notice how they relate to what is going on in the Post. You might learn something new!\r\n\r\nSelecting a Tag on the left performs a search only with that Tag. When a search with only one tag is made, a link to view the Tag's associated Wiki appears. If the Tag has a Wiki, you can read up on whatever information has been written up for it.\r\n\r\nh6. Scoring\r\n\r\nGiven enough time, a Post will eventually gain a score. Maybe the Post demonstrates great execution of artistic skill.

For more information, read on to the next section of this guide, Searching Posts.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4. Searching Posts\r\n\r\nh6. Searching By Tags\r\n\r\nSearching on Danbooru by tags should be easy, even for beginners, with the autocomplete feature. When you type a search term into the search box, a list of suggested tags will appear within a second. Choose from the list of tags which appear to include it in your search. Most fairly modern web browsers support this feature. For the full list of search capabilities and how to use them, see the [[help:cheatsheet|Search Cheatsheet]].\r\n\r\nIf you are still having trouble with searching by tags because what you are searching for isn't appearing, it may be due to differences between Danbooru's tagging conventions compared to other search engines that you have been using.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Two Tags Maximum[/b]\r\n\r\nAs a new Lurker, you will be limited to two tags per search until you get an upgraded account. For more details, refer to the section on [b]Upgrading[/b] end of this guide.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]Tag Conventions and Limitations[/b]\r\n* Danbooru Tags are [b]separated by spaces[/b] (space delimited). This is why spaces cannot be part of a tag's name. Entering [i]hair ribbon[/i] implies two tags, [[hair]] and [[ribbon]].\r\n* Tags made from more than one word use [b]underscores between words[/b]. You may have noticed this when using the tag autocomplete. To search for a [i]hair ribbon[/i], you will use [[hair_ribbon]].\r\n* Punctuation marks may be used but [b]the asterisk (*) is reserved[/b] by Danbooru's search engine as a wildcard symbol. Emote (emoticon) tags, used as shorthand tags for facial expressions, are a good example of punctuation marks in tags.\r\n* Symbols which are not easily input with a plain United States QWERTY PC keyboard layout (the one with the least symbols) are generally avoided where possible. This includes ligatures and diacritics in Latin alphabets, non-Latin orthography, mathematical symbols and emoji.\r\n* [b]Examples:[/b] [[black_rock_shooter]] (no star), [[pokemon]] (no acute on the é), [[:p]], [[>_<]], [[:3]] (shorthand facial expressions)\r\n\r\n[b]Japanese-style Personal Names[/b]\r\n* Danbooru follows the Japanese way of naming people and characters. Depending on the nationality or ethnicity of the person, the last name may be placed before the first name.\r\n* Last name comes first for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, etc.).\r\n* First name comes first for people of most other ethnic backgrounds, unless specifically advised otherwise. For people of mixed backgrounds (e.g. East Asian and non-Asian), it could go either way, so check your sources.\r\n* If you are having trouble looking up a name, try switching the first and last names. You may find a tag for the person or character you are looking for, but in reverse!\r\n* [b]Examples[/b]:  [[remilia_scarlet]], [[paul_robertson]] (surname last), [[ikari_shinji]], [[souryuu_asuka_langley]], [[park_sung_woo]] (surname first).\r\n\r\n[b]Japanese Copyright Titles and Character Names[/b]\r\n* There is currently no standard that which dictates when to use the Japanese name or the non-Japanese one. It could be either.\r\n* Some characters are known by different names to Japanese and international audiences.\r\n* It would be good to know both the Japanese title and the non-Japanese one when searching by copyright. Wikipedia is usually a good place to start. If the non-Japanese title doesn't work, try the Japanese one.\r\n* [b]Copyrights[/b]: [[pocket_monsters]] & [[pokemon]] (both work), [[neon_genesis_evangelion]] (English Title for [i]Shinseiki Evangelion[/i]), [[ace attorney]] (English Title for the [i]Gyakuten Saiban[/i] series).\r\n* [b]Characters[/b]: [[naruhodou_ryuuichi]] & [[phoenix_wright]] (aliased), [[mudkip]] (English for [i]Mizugorou[/i])\r\n\r\n[b]Danbooru Vocabulary and Tag Groups[/b]\r\n* Sometimes, Danbooru may use a different word for its tags. Because figuring out every synonym of the thing you are looking for can be a daunting endeavour, we have prepared a handbook of Danbooru tags, called the [[Tag Groups]].\r\n* The [[Tag Groups]] is like a dictionary of Danbooru's vocabulary.\r\n* We have prepared tag aliases to allow the search engine to recognize common synonyms to the tags we use. It is going to take a while before we cover every word, so for the meantime make use of the [[Tag Groups]].\r\n* [b]Examples[/b]: [b]naga[/b] & [b]lamia[/b], [b]qipao[/b] & [b]china_dress[/b], [b]aeroplane[/b] & [b]airplane[/b], [b]rolled-up_pants[/b] & [b]pants_rolled_up[/b], [b]panty[/b] & [b]panties[/b].\r\n\r\nh6. Tag Search\r\nSuccessful searching by tags requires precise knowledge of the tags. If you are unsure about the name of the tag or its spelling, a tag search can be helpful. A tag search can be initiated by simply typing into a tag search box, using a feature which by now you will have known as autocomplete. \r\n\r\nAutocomplete only lists up to ten results per search. If for any reason you wish to view more than ten results, you can use the Tag Search feature accessible from the \"Tags\":/tags link on the top of the page. The search options should be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between autocomplete and Tag Search is that the latter requires you to place your wildcards (on Danbooru it is the asterisk, [b]*[/b]) manually, while autocomplete tries to guess where you would have placed your wildcards.\r\n\r\nTry the following searches in a search box, then use them in a tag search:\r\n* panty\r\n* panty[b]*[/b]\r\n* [b]*[/b]panties\r\n* panty[b]*[/b]([b]*[/b])\r\n* [b]*[/b]([b]*[/b])\r\n* [b]*[/b]([b]*[/b])[b]*[/b]([b]*[/b])\r\n\r\nWhat results did you get? How are the autocomplete and Tag Search results different?\r\n\r\nh6. Tag Qualifiers\r\nWhen multiple meanings compete for a single tag, we need a means of [i]disambiguation[/i]. Our method of choice is to add [i]qualifiers[/i] at the end of tags, enclosed in parentheses.\r\n\r\nDisambiguations:\r\n* [b]Character[/b]: [[mario]] vs. [[mario_(cosplay)]] (character vs. dressing up as a character).\r\n* [b]Character Names[/b]: [[shimakaze (kancolle)]] vs. [[shimakaze_(azur_lane)]]\r\n* [b]Character Variations[/b]: [[hakurei_reimu]] vs. [[hakurei_reimu_(pc-98)]] (two designs for Hakurei Reimu)\r\n* [b]Diegesis[/b]: [[photo (medium)]] vs. [[photo_(object)]] \r\n* [b]Tag Meanings[/b]: [[panty]] vs. [[panty_(psg)]] (underwear vs. Anarchy Panty), [[araki_hirohiko]] vs [[araki_hirohiko_(style)]] (artist vs. artist's style)\r\n\r\nWhile in most cases one qualifier is sufficient, some Tags may have two or more qualifiers.\r\n* [b]Cosplay of a Character:[/b] [[shimakaze (kancolle) (cosplay)]]\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. Metatags \r\nYou can search and filter Posts by criteria not covered by conventional tags, such as score, source, image pixel size and status. Some metatags are keywords that map to a Post's properties and are a powerful search tool when used properly. There is also the [i]order[/i] metatag which controls how Posts are sorted in a listing.\r\n\r\nTry these searches:\r\n* [b]Post with closely related posts[/b]: {{parent:any}}\r\n* [b]No sex, please![/b] {{is:sfw}}\r\n* [b]Group shots of more than 10 characters[/b]: {{chartags:>10}}\r\n* [b]Artist Collaborations[/b]: {{arttags:>1}}\r\n* [b]Worst Posts Countdown[/b]: {{order:score status:flagged}}\r\n\r\nThe full list of metatags can be found in the [[help:cheatsheet|Search Cheatsheet]].\r\n\r\nA two tag restriction limits the power of metatag searches. If you use metatags a lot, an upgraded account is recommended. For information on how to upgrade, see the information at the end of this guide.\r\n\r\nh6. Image Search with iqdb\r\n\r\nDanbooru has been intergrated with \"iqdb's image search\":http://iqdb.org, so you can track down a tagged copy from our Post gallery with just a picture. The search engine accepts images from your computer's local storage or from another location with a URL.\r\n\r\nHere's a few good uses of iqdb image search:\r\n* When you find a random picture from the internet that turns you on, but you don't know what character is depicted, or who the artist is. \r\n* When you have only a thumbnail or a low quality copy, and you want to find a higher quality version of the picture.\r\n* When you need to find a clean copy of a watermarked image.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are limitations:\r\n* If you want to search an image in a motivator or collage, crop away the motivator or separate the image from the collage first.\r\n* The search engine at iqdb has its filesize limits.\r\n* Danbooru's content is highly moderated, and we won't have every picture in the world! If you are lucky, you may find the picture other sites linked with iqdb.\r\n\r\nTry an iqdb search:\r\n\r\n* Go to your favorite forum or any other place where random anime art is posted a lot. If you can't think of a good place to start, try \"4chan's Ecchi board\":http://boards.4chan.org/e/.\r\n* Copy the URL of a [i]thumbnail[/i] or download it, if safe to do so.\r\n* Paste the URL into the Search URL box at \"iqdb\":http://iqdb.org. If you downloaded the thumbnail, click on the File box instead and locate your thumbnail.\r\n* If iqdb manages to find a match, you will get a list of thumbnails and links to the sites that have a copy. Is the picture available on Danbooru? If it isn't, is it available on another site?\r\n* When a match cannot be found, you might get seemingly random results. If you are geeky enough, can you figure out how iqdb works?\r\n\r\nh4. Browsing Pools\r\n\r\nPools are ordered collections of Posts. Our most common use for Pools are:\r\n\r\n* Keeping track of Posts that belong to a miniseries (such as a specific doujinshi volume).\r\n* Grouping Posts by copyrights that does not yet have a tag.\r\n* Grouping Posts by themes that are difficult or impossible to tag.\r\n\r\nh6. Pool Search and Listing\r\nThe Pool listing and search can be accessed by choosing \"Pools\":/pools at the top of the page from anywhere on Danbooru.\r\n* If you don't perform a search, you will be shown a listing of recently updated Pools.\r\n* Pool searches behave more like standard search engines and the tag  autocomplete. Unlike the Tag search, you do not need to manually place your wildcards.\r\n* [b]Purple[/b] Pools are Series Pools containing Posts meant to be read in order. These are usually multi-page [[comic|manga]], or an ordered series of one-page works.\r\n* [b]Blue[/b] Pools are Collection Pools used to keep Posts of a theme that doesn't yet or cannot have a tag.\r\n\r\nh6. Browsing a Pool\r\nYou can start browsing a Pool by selecting a Pool from the listing. You will be presented a Post listing and an optional description for the Pool. If you want to browse a Pool in order, begin by opening the top-leftmost Post in the first page of the Pool.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing a Post that belongs to a Pool, there will be additional controls below the image and before the comments to allow you to navigate the Pool or return to its Post listing.\r\n\r\nYou will soon notice that some Posts can belong to more than one Pool. There will be controls for each Pool the Post belongs to. If you feel tempted to take a detour and browse another Pool, you are by all means welcome to, but don't get lost!\r\n\r\nWhile you are at it, why not have a browse in some of Danbooru's classic Pools: \r\n\r\n* Badass (pool #1277)\r\n* Clever (pool #330)\r\n* Disgustingly Adorable (pool #903)\r\n* Fund It! (pool #1636)\r\n* Stupidly Clever (pool #3545)\r\n\r\nDanbooru also maintains a list of featured pools in the [[Pool Groups]].\r\n\r\nh6. Filtering (performing a Post search within a Pool)\r\nYou can filter out Posts in a Pool by means of a metatag search, and knowledge of the Pool's id (number). To find out the Pool id, navigate to the top view of the Pool where you see the Post listing. Pay attention to the URL your browser is pointing at. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n* https://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/903\r\n\r\nWhere 903 will be substituted for the id of the Pool you are browsing. Copy down this number, and go to the Posts view to perform your Pool filter or search. Simply add the metatag to your search:\r\n\r\n* {{pool:903}}\r\n\r\nSubstituting 903 for the id of the Pool you are searching. You're already searching within a Pool!\r\n\r\nh4. Accounts, Favorites and Blacklists\r\n\r\nh6. Features that Require an Account\r\nSigning up for a new account is required to use some of Danbooru's other features, such as view options, favorites and blacklists. All new registrations create a basic restricted Member account, which you can upgrade for benefits such as expanded search capabilities. An account is also a starting point for lurkers to become future contributors.\r\n\r\nh6. Before Signing Up (Your Privacy Matters!)\r\nDanbooru is not insulated from search engines that crawl the web. In short, [i]everything[/i] you do on Danbooru will be known to the rest of the world that has access to an (uncensored) internet connection and a web browser. This includes your favorites, and everything that you post should you become a contributor in the future. \r\n\r\nIn other words, if you have a life to lose by having your identity associated with anime-style art and doujinshi, make up a fake name and use it!\r\n\r\nTo create an account right now, scroll up to the top of the page, and follow the [i]\"sign up for a free basic account\":[/users/new/][/i] link.\r\n\r\nh6. View Options with an Account\r\n\r\nWhen viewing Posts with an account, the following options become available:\r\n\r\n[b]Resize to Window[/b]\r\n* Toggles between viewing the image of the Post at full size, and resizing it to fit the [i]width[/i] of the browser's display area.\r\n\r\n[b]Favorite/Unfavorite[/b]\r\n* Adds the Post to your favorites.\r\n* When the post has been already added, the [i]Unfavorite[/i] option, which removes the Post from your favorites, appears in its place. \r\n* Favorites are described in greater in the next section below.\r\n\r\n[b]Find Similar[/b]\r\n* Submits the Post to \"iqdb\":http://iqdb.org/ image search in order to find similar-looking posts on Danbooru or a selection of other similar sites.\r\n\r\n[b]User settings[/b]\r\n* With account available change various [[help:user_settings|settings]].\r\n\r\nh6. Favorites\r\nEvery account comes with a personal pool called Favorites. You are allowed to add any post that you like into your favorites. Use it like collection of bookmarks or links to posts that turn you on. Any user can have any number of favorites, so feel free to favorite as much as you like.\r\n\r\nYou can view your favorites by going to your Account profile (select My Account from the top of the page), and then scrolling down to the Post mini-listing at the bottom. Follow the link named Favorites.\r\n\r\nFor those who love URLs, your Favorites can be accessed at (while Signed In):\r\n\r\n* https://danbooru.donmai.us/favorites\r\n\r\nFavorites do not show up under a Pool search, but you can view another Danbooru User's favorites through their profile page (you can also access this by clicking on their username), or with a metatag search:\r\n\r\n* [b]albert's favorites, by score[/b]: {{fav:albert order:score}}\r\n\r\nh6. Blacklists\r\n\r\nYou can block out Posts based on their tags. This provides a way of hiding posts containing content that you don't like to see. To blacklist content, open up the settings view by going to [i]My Account[/i], and then to [i]Basic Settings[/i]. Scroll down to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere will be a box labelled [i]Blacklisted tags[/i]. This is how it works:\r\n\r\n* Each line contains a list of tags separated by spaces. This will be a single blacklist [b]criterion[/b].\r\n* Start a new list of tags on a new line (with Enter/Return).\r\n* Posts that contain every tag in a single line will be hidden from view.\r\n\r\nLet's try an example blacklist. Enter this into the Blacklisted tags box, remembering to start a new line with enter/return:\r\n[quote]\r\ntouhou\r\nblonde_hair long_hair breasts\r\n-rating:s,g\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n* Go searching or browsing Posts. You may find that the Post listing is a little more empty than before. This is the tag blacklist in action.\r\n* Look around. What do you notice missing?\r\n* There will be a new group of options on the left side of the Post listing view labelled [i]Blacklisted[/i]. It's the very same tags that you entered into the blacklist box.\r\n* Click on each of the blacklist criteria to reveal the blacklisted Posts. You will need to toggle each blacklist criterion separately.\r\n\r\nHere is what the blacklist did:\r\n* [[touhou]] : Blocks out Posts with references to the [[touhou|Touhou Project]]. Everyone's beloved youkai girls disappear.\r\n* {{blonde_hair long_hair breasts}} : Blocks out Posts containing all blondes, long hair and breasts at the same time. Notice that you still can see breast glamor shots of long-haired models that aren't blonde, and breast glamor shots of blonde models with short hair, and pictures of long-haired blondes that don't focus on breasts.\r\n* {{-rating:s,g}} : Blocks out posts that are not rated either sensitive or general. This is similar to browsing on \"Donmai.moe\":[https://donmai.moe]. In Danbooruspeak, this is a negation blacklist on a metatag.\r\n\r\nSome posts may require you to turn off more than one blacklist criteria before you can see them.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Privacy (and Purity) Note[/b]\r\n\r\nBlacklists simply hide the Post, but the post thumbnail is still downloaded to your system. You may want to read up on web browser privacy if you are really concerned about Danbooru content on your system.\r\n\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nTo reverse these changes, go back to [i]My Account[/i] and then [i]Settings[/i], scroll down and remove everything you typed into the blacklist box.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that blacklisting based on metatags and negation isn't fully supported yet. Some negations and metatag combinations will not work properly. You may not be able to filter posts by score and favcount, for example.\r\n\r\nh4.

Israel accused Hamas of indiscriminately killings civilians in order to justify a full scale invasion of the Gaza Strip to \"neutralize Hamas once and for all\".\r\n\r\nThe war quickly devolved into a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip by the [[Israel Defense Forces]], with multiple cases of scorched earth tactics used by the IDF, levelling Palestinian settlements and starving the population (a charge Israel denies, often claiming their attacks are \"precision strikes\" against Hamas), along with various claims and evidence of atrocities committed by the IDF. This led to call for ceasefire and support for Palestine around the world.\r\n\r\nThe war has also spilled over into various other Middle Eastern countries, particularly countries under the influence of [[Iran]] such as [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and the Houthi-controlled areas of [[Yemen]], while Israel receives military and political support from the [[United States]] and NATO, which led some analysts to consider the war a proxy conflict between the US and Iran.\r\n\r\nThe conflict has brought the overall Israel-Palestine conflict into the public forefront, and has been a divisive topic that has been both defended and condemned to the most extreme extent. Supporters of Palestine often condemn the war as an example of \"continued European colonization\" and of genocidal oppression, while supporters of Israel argue that Israel has the right to \"defend themselves\" against hostile forces, regardless of the ways in which this is achieved.\r\n\r\nh4.

Joe[/i][/b] is a famous and classic line of [[military]] [[action figure]]s produced and owned by the [[Hasbro]] American toy company. \r\n\r\n\"G.I.\" ([i]Government Issue[/i]) is a generic term for U.S. soldiers. The development of the first G.I. Joe toy led to the coining of the term \"action figure\". G.I. Joe's appeal to children has made it an American icon among toys. The action figure line has also become famous in many different countries across the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe G.I. Joe trademark has been used by Hasbro to title two different toy lines. \r\n\r\nThe original 12-inch (30 cm) line that began in 1964 centered on realistic action figures. In the United Kingdom, this line was licensed to Palitoy and known as [i]Action Man[/i]. \r\n\r\nThe initial product offering represented four of the branches of the U.S. armed forces with the Action Soldier (U.S. Army), Action Sailor (U.S. Navy), Action Pilot (USAF), Action Marine (USMC) and later on, the Action Nurse. \r\n\r\nThen in 1982, the line was relaunched in a much smaller 3.75-inch (9.5 cm) scale complete with new futuristic vehicles, detailed playsets, and a complex and rich background story involving an ongoing struggle between the [i]G.I. Joe [/i] team and the evil [[Cobra Command]] organization which seeks to take over the Free World through [[terrorism]] and using advanced and sophisticated weaponry. \r\n\r\nThe new 80s line was initially intended as a means to sell the new toy vehicles, but over time the unique characters and their different and detailed action figures became much more popular and extremely sought after to this day.\r\n\r\nThe 1982 toy line became extremely successful and was also supported by two animated series as well as a major [[comic]] series published initially by [[Marvel]] Comics which expanded each character's background and mythos which were mostly developed by Marvel writer/artist \"Larry Hama\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hama .\r\n\r\nh4.

Beating dungeons eventually gives enough experience points to allow the player to level up so their rank, stamina, team cost, and monster box capacity may increase. Another factor of gameplay is the player collecting, fusing, and evolving their monsters in order to make them stronger. Utilizing monster abilities and stats is vital to the gameplay, especially later on in the game.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 1400 and counting unique monsters that can be collected by the player. These range from traditional [[dragon|dragons]], [[demon|demons]], [[ogre|ogres]], [[goblin|goblins]], and [[knight|knights]] to mythological figures from various real world cultures and religions, fictionalized versions of popular historical figures, and even third party fictional characters.\r\n\r\n[[crossover|The game also does various collaborations with several anime and video game properties]] which are usually Japanese only.
