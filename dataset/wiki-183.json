Additionally, she acts as [[Urd ((aa megami-sama)|]]'s stepmother, and even treats her just like her own daughters. That being said, Ansuz displays a pretty \"hands-off\" parenting attitude, most likely due to her duties. As a result, she doesn't seem to be as close to her daughters as they are to each other, which is especially true in Skuld's case who was all but raised by Belldandy. \r\n\r\nPart of Ansuz's duties is to act as the Interspecies Romance Inquisitor, whose job is to test any god or goddess who wishes to get into a relationship with another species (whether demon, or mortal), by sending them through the Judgment Gate. This was also the case with Hild and Tyr (whom Ansuz eventually married after this event, while the only ones shown to pass it, are Belldandy and Keiichi. \r\n\r\nDespite Hild's status as Tyr's ex-wife, Ansuz seems to maintain a good relationship with her. They do enjoy playing games together, and she even expresses her disappointment when Hagall tells her that she needs to leave Hell, before she ends up getting trapped in there. Still, that doesn't stop her and Hild from antagonizing each other, although it should be noted that they're not really all that serious about it.\r\n\r\nAnsuz is named after the eponymous \"A\" rune from the Elder Futhark, and at the time of writing this, she remains a manga-exclusive character.
