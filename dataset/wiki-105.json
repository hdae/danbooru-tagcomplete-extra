The plane is also a maintenance nightmare, due to the fact that its Jumo 002 engines have very limited lifespan of 21 hours of usage and causing a strain on Germany's lack of supply. Furthermore, contary to popular belief, the Allied powers have also deployed their jet aircraft into the European theatre (most notably [[P-80 Shooting Star]] and [[Gloster Meteor]]) during the early 1944, which means that the plane will not affect the course of the war regardless of how early it was deployed.\r\n\r\nh4.See Also\r\n* [[Ki-201 karyuu]]\r\n* [[kikka (airplane)]]\r\n* [[list of airplanes]]\r\n\r\nh4.External Links\r\n* \"Wikipedia: Messerschmitt Me 262\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Me262"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":18318,"created_at":"2010-05-02T19:05:25.331-04:00","updated_at":"2023-02-13T05:01:37.963-05:00","title":"p-38_lightning","body":"American [[World War II]] twin-engined piston fighter.

The original game was a beat 'em up [[video game]] conceived by \"Kishimoto Yoshihisa\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihisa_Kishimoto (creator of the [[Kunio-kun series]]) and developed by \"Technōs Japan\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techn%C5%8Ds_Japan . It was distributed in North America and Europe by [[Taito]] Corporation. \r\n\r\nThe game was a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, [[Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun]] (released outside of Japan by Taito as [i]Renegade[/i]), but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.\r\n\r\nHome versions of the game were released for the [[NES]], [[Sega Master System]], Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Game Boy, [[Sega Mega Drive]]/Sega Genesis and Atari Lynx, among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A remake titled Double Dragon Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The NES version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on April 28, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. Nintendo also released the Game Boy version on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2011.\r\n\r\nAnother remake was released for the iOS mobile devices in 2011, which features brand new gameplay, sprites, animations and music. \r\n\r\nSeveral sequels of the original game have been produced during the years for the arcade and different home consoles. A competitive fighting version was produced for the [[Neo Geo]] game console during the 90s.\r\n\r\nA new Double Dragon title, [[Double Dragon Neon]], was released in 2012 for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and is considered a reboot of the series.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary, Arc System Works released Double Dragon IV in 2017. It takes place shortly after Double Dragon II and uses an 8-bit artstyle.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[Jimmy Lee]]\r\n* [[Billy Lee]]\r\n* [[Marian Kelly]]\r\n\r\nh4.

It is the successor aircraft to Mitsubishi's own [[G3M]] and the de-facto predecessor of the Yokosuka [[P1Y Ginga]] bomber.\r\n\r\nThe [[airplane]] can be easily distinguished by its [[cigar]]-shaped fuselage, hence the nickname \"flying cigar\", albeit also attributed to its fragility to anti-air: like the [[A6M Zero]] and the [[Ki-43 Hayabusa]], the early versions of the aircraft achieved their performance (especially range) at the expense of armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, making it vulnerable to enemy machine gun hits. This weakness is increased if the aircraft is used as a torpedo bomber due to its large size. This was what claimed [[Yamamoto Isoroku]]'s life in mid-1943 when he was shot down by US fighters in the Solomon Islands (see post #3810385).\r\n\r\nIt was designed by Honjou Kirou [本庄 季郎] and entered combat for first time in June 1941.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* Mitsubishi [[G3M]]\r\n* [[List of Airplanes]]\r\n\r\nh4.
