leader of [[Malawi]] from 1961 to 1994.\r\n\r\n After receiving much of his education overseas, Banda returned to his home country (then British Nyasaland) to speak against colonialism and advocate independence. In 1963 he was formally appointed prime minister of Nyasaland and, a year later, led the country to independence as Malawi. Two years later he proclaimed Malawi a republic with himself as president. He consolidated power and later declared Malawi a one-party state under the [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP). In 1970 the MCP made him the party's President for Life. In 1971 he became President for Life of Malawi itself.\r\n\r\nAs a leader of the pro-Western bloc in Africa he received support from the West during the [[Cold War]]. He generally supported women's rights, improved the country's infrastructure and maintained a good educational system relative to other African countries but also presided over one of the most repressive regimes in Africa. His government regularly tortured and murdered political opponents. Human rights groups estimate that at least 6,000 people were killed, tortured and jailed without trial. As many as 18,000 people were killed during his rule according to one estimate. He was scorned for maintaining full diplomatic relations with apartheid-era [[South Africa]].\r\n\r\nBy 1993 he was facing international pressure and widespread protest. A referendum ended his one-party state and a special assembly ended his life-term presidency, stripping him of most of his powers. Banda ran for president in the democratic elections which followed and was defeated. He died in South Africa in 1997.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヘイスティングズ・カムズ・バンダ","ヘイスティングズ・バンダ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194931,"created_at":"2024-06-01T16:07:46.253-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T16:08:08.064-04:00","title":"iran-iraq_war","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["イラン・イラク戦争","イライラ戦争","イ・イ戦争","(ペルシャ)湾岸戦争","第一次湾岸戦争"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":87703,"created_at":"2017-07-03T13:03:33.859-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T16:06:26.950-04:00","title":"niqab","body":"A [[veil]] worn by some Islamic women.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ニカブ","نقاب","روبند"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194927,"created_at":"2024-06-01T15:41:47.083-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T15:41:47.083-04:00","title":"portuguese_man_o'_war","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["カツオノエボシ","鰹の烏帽子","電気クラゲ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194925,"created_at":"2024-06-01T15:39:36.855-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T15:39:36.855-04:00","title":"franco-prussian_war","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["普仏戦争","独仏戦争","1870年戦争","プロイセン=フランス戦争"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194923,"created_at":"2024-06-01T15:37:41.983-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T15:37:41.983-04:00","title":"yemen","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ٱلْيَمَنْ","イエメン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194922,"created_at":"2024-06-01T15:37:12.147-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T15:37:12.147-04:00","title":"lebanon","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["لُبْنَان","レバノン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":175896,"created_at":"2023-10-31T17:47:54.423-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T15:33:23.958-04:00","title":"brics","body":"A geopolitical bloc consisting of [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]], and [[South Africa]].

Since Japan stopped producing cylindrical postboxes in 1970 and has been replacing them with rectangular ones, the older cylindrical design has gained cultural and sentimental value, and a few are being preserved.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly shown design is the Postal submissions box No. 1 (round) 「郵便差出箱1号（丸型）」, dating from 1949. [Not to be confused with the 1970 submissions box No. 1 (rectangular) 「郵便差出箱1号（角型）」.]\r\nThe letter slot is cut into a circular panel on the upper section of the postbox, and is shielded by a curved eave. Collection times are posted on the collection plate, to one side of the circular panel. A square access hatch sits on the lower section of the postbox, below the letter slot. Unlike later, rectangular designs in which mail gets deposited directly into a mailbag that can be removed via a large door, the cylindrical design required loose mail items to be collected by hand through its relatively smaller hatch. This inefficiency led to it being phased out.\r\n\r\nThis tag is [b]not[/b] intended for all cylindrical postboxes. Some artistic liberty is allowed, such as variation in size and proportion, or missing/misplaced collection plate or access hatch, but the general design elements must be there. (e.g. post #1109518, despite the [[Japanese postal mark]] and small access hatch, more closely resembles a UK design in terms of shape and letter slot placement.)\r\n\r\nh4.

The Goonies II was released in North America, Europe, and Australia, although the original was one of the NES games released as part of the Nintendo VS. System arcade machine in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nThe Goonies II has little to do with the film. In it, the Fratellis have kidnapped all the Goonies (except [[mikey_(the_goonies)|Mikey]], whom the player guides) and have hidden them in cages across a terrain of caverns, mazes, and abandoned buildings. As Mikey, the player must rescue them all and ultimately free a mermaid named [[annie_(the_goonies)|Annie]]. Mikey was also a playable character in Konami's 1988 Famicom title Wai Wai World, which included a Goonies-themed level.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* \"Music Video\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxLhytQ67fs","is_locked":false,"other_names":["グーニーズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194563,"created_at":"2024-05-27T17:37:37.217-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:37:37.217-04:00","title":"onda_aka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["恩田赤"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":126373,"created_at":"2021-07-21T09:50:56.583-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:04:29.132-04:00","title":"long_shirt","body":"A [[shirt]] long enough to cover one’s hips/pelvic area when worn.\r\n\r\nDoes not necessitate [[long sleeves]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. \r\n\r\nCuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of 109,884 square kilometres (42,426 sq mi), and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. Its official language is [[spanish_text|Spanish]].\r\n\r\nUntil the 15th century, it was inhabited by Amerindian tribes which became a colony of [[Spain]] until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952.\r\n\r\nFurther unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established [[communism|communist]] rule under the leadership of [[Fidel Castro]].\r\n\r\nSince 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. A point of contention during the [[Cold War]] between the [[soviet|Soviet Union]] and the [[united states|United States]], a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Cuba is one of the few remaining Marxist–Leninist socialist states.\r\n\r\nCulturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\r\n\r\nh4.
