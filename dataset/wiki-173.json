Her familiar is the black [[fox]].\r\n\r\nEila's magic ability Foresight (未来予知, Mirai Yochi) grants her a limited ability to predict the future. Her hobby is fortune-telling with tarot cards, although the accuracy of her predictions is questionable at best. Similar to stereotypes of her familiar (the black fox), she has a reputation for mischief, being fond of pranks amongst her colleagues and is somewhat mischievous.\r\n\r\nEila is often partnered with 501st Night Witch [[Sanya V. Litvyak]], and perhaps as a result (perhaps it is simply chemistry) the two have become very close; Eila is often portrayed as fiercely protective of her younger squadmate and takes on a sometimes awkwardly nurturing role during down-time.

As a robot, she is characterized by her long hair, peculiar feet, and her armor (more specifically her upper armor that barely cover any part of her chest).\r\n\r\nShe is the basic air unit players can get at the start of the game, and also has a [[chibi]] form. There are several variations of her hair color and parts in-game.\r\n\r\nCrimrose is one of the few characters in [[Cosmic Break]] that currently have an alternate/'promotion' form, along with [[Lily Rain]], [[Winberrl]] and [[LazFlamme]]. Her alternate form is known as [[Seraph Crimrose]], characterized by a pair of additional wings protruding from her back.\r\n\r\nShe is pretty much considered the [[Cosmic Break]] mascot and one of the main characters of the Cosmic Break story. She is also featured as an NPC in the game.\r\n\r\nWhile her story is still unclear, it is said in the mangas that she met [[Ivis]] in a research facility when they were younger, and died during experiments to find a host for a powerful weapon, along with several other children. Her death made Ivis go berserk, sucessfully activating the weapon and killing everyone in the facility. Crimrose was later revived at the Cosmic Ark without any memories of her time alive and met Ivis again, although the latter had developed an obssession for Crimrose because of the traumas she experienced in the research facility and, after learning that Crimrose didn't remember her and seeing her acting friendly towards other people, went berserk once again. Her rampage was stopped by Seraph Crimrose, fortunately before she killed anyone, and she escaped. It is stated in Ivis' in-game description that Crimrose bought her back to her senses, although this is never shown. \r\n\r\nCrimrose is later seen along with Ivis in Ground Area, talking to player about their ACs, and as a normal student in Angel Academy.\r\n\r\nIn the game [[Cosmic Break 2]], another Crimrose from the alternate timeline is one of the starter characters.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クリムローゼ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30054,"created_at":"2011-11-03T09:45:34.087-04:00","updated_at":"2021-07-04T23:51:19.351-04:00","title":".flow","body":"[b].flow[/b] is a [i][[Yume Nikki]][/i] fangame made by a Japanese developer going under the alias \"[i]lol[/i]\". \r\nIt features an exploratory-type gameplay style as a girl named [[Sabitsuki]] explores her mind.

She debuted on February 24, 2021 as Voice-Ore production's first generation virtual voice actor, her Live2D was designed by [[nabi_(uz02)|Nabi]] and her rigging by Takeyanagi.\r\n\r\nA 17 year old girl from an influential family, ever since she was young she has lived a carefully sheltered life raised \"surrounded by butterflies and flowers\". Because of the upbringing by her household she has rarely a chance to meet or interact with others that she could open her heart to, thus has a hard time showing her true feelings but deep down is a very expressive and [[tsundere]] young girl. Despite living under strict parents that banned all things anime and game related she still developed a love for them and secretly works toward her dream of becoming a voice actor. \r\n\r\nHer appearance is that of a [[blunt_bangs|blunt bang]] [[silver_hair|silvered]] prim and proper \"Ojou-sama\":https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou with [[long_hair|long flowing hair]], giving off a very cool and elegant vibe but those that get close to her will see that she can be quite silly at times, especially during her \"Rena teatime\" when she interact and holds conversation with her chat regarding the weather, her day or how she is still sleepy right after having just gotten out of bed to stream. She wears a [[layered_dress|multi-layered]] [[long_sleeves|long sleeve]] [[white_dress|frilly white dress]] adorned in [[black_ribbon|ribbons]] and a [[brooch]] with a [[black_bow|black bow]]. Her eyes are [[blue_eyes|light blue-ish purple]] and she sports a slightly stoic yet sleepy look with jeweled [[earrings]] hidden behind on her ears.  \r\n\r\nRena understands English well enough to read and speak it, as well as understands German that she notes she's been studying. She enjoys fantasy and tea, as well as chocolate and other confectionery. As a \"Vseiyuu\", whenever she plays a game she would also tend to read out in-game texts in different ranges of voices based on what she think the character sounds like. She is friends with her fellow Voice-Ore members, [[Himukai_Kogane|Himukai Kogane]] and [[Aoi_Mizuki|Aoi Mizuki]], who often drop by in her chat and refer to them as Koga-chan and Mizuki-chan.\r\n\r\nHer other emoji is also 🕊, a white bird/Dove based on her name \"Shiratori ([b]白鳥[/b])\" which reads as such respectively (white bird), and her personal greeting to her fans is [i]Guten Rena[/i] based on the German phrase of \"Good morning/day ([i]Guten Tag/Morgen[/i]) and [i]Tschüss[/i] (\"Good bye/Bye Bye\" in German).  The official name for her fans is [b]Renavants[/b].\r\n\r\nh4.

His most significant role is in the \"[i]Shigisan-engi[/i]\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigisan-engi emaki. \r\n\r\nThe [i]Shigisan-engi[/i] is also the basis for [[Touhou|Touhou's]] [i][[Undefined Fantastic Object]][/i]. In it, it is told that he had an older sister, who was worried about him. So she searched for Myouren and after being reunited with him, the two lived together again. This woman is the basis for [[Hijiri Byakuren]], whose brother's later death drove her to despair and made her fear her own mortality.\r\n\r\nHis role in Touhou is minor, only serving as backstory for Byakuren. However, ZUN has said he once considered Myouren for a main role in UFO, albeit as an old man. No official character design exists for him, leaving his appearance up to speculation. Fanart typically depicts him with [[gradient hair]] like his sister's, despite the fact that a Buddhist monk would normally have [[bald|shaved off all his hair]].\r\n\r\nh4.
