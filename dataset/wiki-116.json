He was known for flaunting his enormous wealth.  \r\n\r\nOne night, Yamamoto was leaving after an extravagant meal at a restaurant in Hakodate, when he saw a geisha searching around in the foyer for her shoes, having trouble because of the darkness.  He therefore pulled out a ¥100 bill (now worth about ¥1 million, allowing for inflation) and lit it to brighten the area.  The incident became famous as an anecdote of [i]nouveau riche[/i] behavior.\r\n\r\nYears later, an artist named Kunibo Wada heard of the incident and drew a satirical cartoon depicting the situation, entitled \"\"The Age of Nouveau Riche Splendor\":[https://kyuman.art/themes/main/facility/images/img_works_10.jpg]\".  The cartoon appears in current Japanese history textbooks and so has some slight fame among the public.
