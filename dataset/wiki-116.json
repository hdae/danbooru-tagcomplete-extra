Most of his works fall into the \"harem\" genre and feature ecchi material.\r\n\r\nIn his teenage years, Akamatsu failed the entrance exam to Tokyo University, and applied for Film Study instead (it is speculated that this is where he got the idea for Love Hina). Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野 亜和, Mizuno Awa \"[1]\":[#dtext-external-links]). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated.\r\n\r\nAfter a big hit with [[ai_ga_tomaranai!|A・I ga Tomaranai!]] (A.I. Love You), he finally made a grand success with his new manga, [[Love Hina]]. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001. Akamatsu had added elements of his own life experiences to the story, and this was said to have induced a unique feeling to the manga especially for Western readers, whose lack of familiarity with Japanese culture for the most part added to the effect. The series, published in America in 2002, was especially well received in many overseas countries - Akamatsu was surprised that even foreign readers found Love Hina to be \"cute\" and to their liking.\r\n\r\nHe is married to his wife 'Kanon' Akamatsu. Love Hina and the his manga after that, [[Mahou Sensei Negima!]] (Negima!: Magister Negi Magi), were made into an anime series produced by XEBEC. A second independent retelling of Negima by SHAFT was made called [b]Negima!?[/b] \"[2]\":[#dtext-external-links], but it never reached the popularity of the first series or [[Love Hina]]. It is has also been aired as a live action series. \r\n\r\nHis current manga is [[UQ Holder!]], a story in the same universe as Negima. It received an anime adaptation by JC Staff that was based on a backup plot.\r\n\r\nHe later announced in December 2021 he would be running in the summer 2022 elections for a seat in the House of Councillors, the upper house of Japan's House of Representatives, through a nationwide proportional district with a platform \"to protect freedom of expression, artistic freedom and creators' rights in Japan from foreign and domestic puritan and politically correct censorship, standards, regulations and influences\" according to Wikipedia.

Contra 4 was produced by [[Konami]] Digital Entertainment in America and developed by WayForward Technologies, making it the first Contra game developed by a foreign western company, as well as the first original Contra game for a portable platform since the 1991 [[Game Boy]] game [i]Operation C[/i]. \r\n\r\nAs the game's title indicates, Contra 4 was designed to be a direct sequel to the Contra games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and [[Super Nintendo]] ([[Contra]], [[Super Contra]], and [[Contra III The Alien Wars]]), with a gameplay model similar to those games. In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original Contra the game also includes several playable characters from many different Contra games.\r\n\r\nh4.

So named for the gangsters who supposedly demonstrate this technique in gunfights. Frequently combined with [[dual wielding]].\r\n\r\nShooting a gun in this way has no practical benefit under most circumstances and makes proper aiming very difficult. However, the style has become somewhat popular in rap culture and among street criminals (who do not often use the gun sight) due to its portrayal in U.S. film and television since the 1990s, which in turn was inspired by Hong Kong action cinema beginning in the '70s and '80s. It is believed that Hong Kong actors needed to hold their guns in this way because some Chinese-made automatics couldn't eject shell casings reliably.\r\n\r\nIt is also known that this type of grip was sometimes used during the Chinese Civil War of the '30s and '40s with full-auto versions of the top-ejecting [[Mauser C96|Mauser C96 \"Broomhandle\"]] pistol, which had an extremely high rate of fire and significant muzzle climb when fired normally. When held in what's now known as gangsta style and fired, the muzzle would instead \"climb\" sideways and thus sweep across everything in front of the shooter. A similar technique was sometimes used with submachine guns during World War II, but as they were significantly bulkier and heavier than the C96 it was considerably more awkward.\r\n\r\nh4.
