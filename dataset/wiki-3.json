It is Canada's largest province by area, bordering Ontario in the west, Newfoundland and Labrador to the northeast, and New Brunswick to the southeast, and has coastal borders with Nunavut. \r\n\r\nThe official language of the province is French. Quebec French (also known as Québécois) is the predominant variety, having some differences (primarily in pronunciations and vocabulary) when compared to European French. \r\n\r\nThe province was settled by Paleo-Indians during the Last Glacial Maximum and was first explored by Europeans under Jacques Cartier in 1534, who would claim it for the Kingdom of France. France would continue to hold on to the colony until 1763, when ownership of the colony was transferred to the United Kingdom after the French and Indian War (AKA the Seven Years' War). It would later join the Dominion of Canada in 1867. In 1960, the Quiet Revolution would achieve major reforms throughout the province.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Québec is Québec City (French: Ville de Québec) and the largest cities are Montréal, Gatineau, Trois-Rivières, and Sherbrooke. \r\n\r\nQuébec is the birthplace of [[poutine]] and is known for helping to popularize the sport of ice [[hockey]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Her outfit consists of a [[long sleeves|long sleeved]] [[corset]]ed [[white dress|white]] [[off-shoulder dress]] with a [[red ribbon]] in front. She also wears a [[black hairband]] with a [[mini crown]], [[white thighhighs]] held up by [[garter straps]], [[high heels|high heeled]] [[black shoes|black]] [[mary janes]], and a silver [[necklace]]. \r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] is in the shape of a [[throne]] which she sits on, and contains her real-life crane and two 38 cm twin gun mounts, her real-life mainmast as a [[scepter]], and a [[globus cruciger]]. \r\n\r\nShe is often considered the first foreign shipgirl to actually be able to speak her native language properly by fans, unlike those before her (the German and Italian shipgirls, [[iowa (kancolle)|Iowa]], [[kongou (kancolle)|Kongou]] and [[verniy (kancolle)|Verniy]] to an extent) that have been notorious for their [[ranguage]]. She even goes so far as to speak her English lines in a native-sounding, vaguely British accent (largely thanks to her voice actress being born in Australia). Although Warspite speaks with a Western-sounding accent, actual sentences, such as \"Sally go!\" demonstrate grammar a native speaker would not use.\r\n\r\nWarspite behaves in the manner of a sedate, high-class British lady. She is often depicted in fanart alongside fellow English-speakers [[Iowa (kancolle)|]] and [[Kongou (Kancolle)|]]. She has hourly lines talking about Italian ships [[Littorio (kancolle)|]] and [[Roma (kancolle)|]], who she unsuccessfully tried to escort out of Italy following the Italian surrender, and [[Zara (kancolle)|]] and [[Pola (kancolle)|]], who she sank.\r\n\r\nThe historic HMS [i]Warspite[/i] was the Royal Navy's most decorated battleship, serving in both World War I and II.

All you need is a way to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to URLs. Responses are given in either XML or JSON format.\r\n\r\nh1. Testing\r\n\r\nAPI calls can be tested on https://testbooru.donmai.us. Scripts should be tested there before using them on the main site.\r\n\r\nh1. Basics\r\n\r\nHTTP defines four basic request methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. You'll be using these methods to interact with the Danbooru API. Most API calls that change the state of the database (like creating, updating, or deleting something) require an HTTP POST, PUT or DELETE call. API calls that only retrieve data can typically be done with an HTTP GET call.\r\n\r\nA URL is considered a resource and the HTTP methods are actions you perform on the resource. For example, GET \"/posts/23.json\":/posts/23.json returns a JSON representation of post #23. GET \"/posts/23.xml\":/posts/23.xml returns an XML representation. PUT or PATCH /posts/6.json would update the resource, for example changing its tags.\r\n\r\nSome resources require parameters. For example, you can find tags that start with the letter 'a' by calling GET \"/tags.json?search[name_matches]=a*\":/tags.json?search[name_matches]=a*. This will give you a JSON listing of all tags with names starting with an a.\r\n\r\nFor POST, PUT and DELETE requests you must pass these parameters along in the body instead of the query parameters. Body parameters may be encoded in one of two ways. The usual way is with key-values pairs using \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\":\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl -u \"$login:$api_key\" -X PUT \"https://testbooru.donmai.us/posts/6.json\" -d 'post[rating]=s&post[tag_string]=danboo'\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nParameters may also be encoded as JSON using \"Content-Type: application/json\":\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl -u \"$login:$api_key\" -X PUT \"https://testbooru.donmai.us/posts/6.json\" -d '{ \"post\": { \"rating\": \"s\", \"tag_string\": \"danboo\" } }' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh1. Responses\r\n\r\nAll API calls that change state will return a single element response (for XML calls). They are formatted like this:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<response success=\"false\" reason=\"duplicate\"/>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nFor JSON responses, they'll look like this:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n{ \"success\": false, \"reason\": \"duplicate\" }\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nWhile you can usually determine success or failure based on the response object, you can also figure out what happened based on the HTTP status code. In addition to the standard ones, Danbooru uses some custom status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range.\r\n\r\n* [b]200 OK[/b]: Request was successful\r\n* [b]204 No Content[/b]: Request was successful (returned by create actions)\r\n* [b]400 Bad Request[/b]: The given parameters could not be parsed\r\n* [b]401 Unauthorized[/b]: Authentication failed\r\n* [b]403 Forbidden[/b]: Access denied (see [[help:users]] for permissions information)\r\n* [b]404 Not Found[/b]: Not found\r\n* [b]410 Gone[/b]: Pagination limit (see [[help:users]] for pagination limits)\r\n* [b]420 Invalid Record[/b]: Record could not be saved\r\n* [b]422 Locked[/b]: The resource is locked and cannot be modified\r\n* [b]423 Already Exists[/b]: Resource already exists\r\n* [b]424 Invalid Parameters[/b]: The given parameters were invalid\r\n* [b]429 User Throttled[/b]: User is throttled, try again later (see [[help:users]] for API limits)\r\n* [b]500 Internal Server Error[/b]: A database timeout, or some unknown error occurred on the server\r\n* [b]502 Bad Gateway[/b]: Server cannot currently handle the request, try again later (returned during heavy load)\r\n* [b]503 Service Unavailable[/b]: Server cannot currently handle the request, try again later (returned during downbooru)\r\n\r\nh1. Authentication\r\n\r\nYou will need an API key if you need to login using the API. You can generate an API key by visiting your \"user profile\":/profile and clicking the Generate API key button.\r\n\r\nTo authenticate with the API, pass the [code]login[/code] and [code]api_key[/code] URL parameters, where [code]login[/code] is your username and [code]api_key[/code] is your API key:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nhttps://danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json?login=your_username&api_key=your_api_key\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nYou can also authenticate using \"HTTP Basic Authentication\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication]:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl \"https://$username:$api_key@danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json\"\r\ncurl --user \"$username:$api_key\" https://danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nMost HTTP libraries support HTTP basic authentication out of the box. If yours doesn't, you can generate the authentication header manually. The format is [code]Authentication: Basic $secret[/code] where [code]$secret = base64($username + \":\" + $api_key)[/code]. In other words, concatenate your username and API key together, separated by a colon, then \"Base64\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 encode the result:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\ncurl --header \"Authorization: Basic $(printf \"%s\" \"$username:$api_key\" | base64)\" https://danbooru.donmai.us/profile.json\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nIf you are writing a user script for a browser, you do not need to embed an API key. You can rely on the user's session.\r\n\r\n⚠️ [b]IMPORTANT![/b] Keep your API key secret. Treat it like a password. Gaining access to it allows full access to your account. Do not publicly post your API key or distribute it in scripts.\r\n\r\nh1. Rate Limits\r\nThere's a global rate limit  on read requests of 10 requests per second regardless of account or endpoint.\r\n\r\nMost kinds of update actions are rate limited according to user level:\r\n\r\n* Basic users: 1 update/second\r\n* Gold users and above: 4 updates/second\r\n\r\nEach rate-limited endpoint has a burst pool, which lets a user make several consecutive updates before being rate limited. The rate at which the pool is recharged depends on the endpoint, but most follow the rates above.\r\n\r\nThe burst pool size, recharge rate, and current limits are returned as JSON in the [code]x-rate-limit[/code] HTTP header. They can also be found at \"/rate_limits\":[/rate_limits], which shows the limits as of the last API call (the page won't update until the API is used again).\r\n\r\nRate limits are shared between accounts and IP addresses: multiple accounts with the same IP address will share the same rate limit.\r\n\r\nh1. Queries\r\n\r\nh4. Common Search Parameters\r\n\r\nAll search endpoints support a common set of parameters:\r\n\r\n* [b]page[/b] Returns the given page. Subject to maximum page limits (see [[help:users]]).\r\n              You can also use [code]b<id>[/code] and [code]a<id>[/code] to request results before <id> or after <id>, respectively.\r\n              E.g. to get a page of posts before post #999999, you'd make a request to [code]/posts.json?page=b999999[/code].\r\n* [b]limit[/b] The number of results to return per page. The maximum limit is 200 for /posts.json and 1000 for everything else.\r\n* [b]search[id][/b]\r\n* [b]search[created_at][/b]\r\n* [b]search[updated_at][/b]\r\n* [b]search[order]=custom[/b] Returns results in the same order as given by [code]search[id]=3,2,1[/code].\r\n\r\nh5. Parameter Parsing\r\n\r\nNumeric search parameters support ranges:\r\n\r\n* [code]100[/code]\r\n* [code]>100[/code]\r\n* [code]>=100[/code]\r\n* [code]<100[/code]\r\n* [code]<=100[/code]\r\n* [code]100,200,300[/code]\r\n* [code]100..200[/code] (inclusive)\r\n\r\nDate parameters also support ranges:\r\n\r\n* [code]2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]>2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]>=2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]<2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]<=2012-01-01[/code]\r\n* [code]2012-01-01,2012-01-02[/code]\r\n* [code]2012-01-01..2013-01-01[/code] (inclusive)\r\n\r\nBoolean parameters accept any of the following values for true or false:\r\n\r\n* True: true, t, yes, y, on, 1\r\n* False: false, f, no, n, off, 0\r\n\r\nMost string parameters support using asterisks ([code]*[/code]) as wildcards. Wildcards can be escaped with [code]\\*[/code]. Literal backslashes can be escaped with [code]\\\\[/code]. \r\n\r\nh1.

In this genre, the protagonist instead takes the lover of someone else. Also related is cuckolding, in which seeking out others is actively encouraged, even at the expense of the cuckold.\r\n\r\nPosts on Danbooru should include the presence of the cheated on in some form, physical or otherwise (such as on the phone, as is common), or mentioned at some significant length.

After [[Ryou Sakazaki|Ryo Sakazaki]] and [[Robert Garcia]] ran Geese out of town, Mr. Big disappeared for a time, with no love lost for Geese. In [[Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves]], twelve years after Geese's death by [[Terry Bogard]], Mr. Big returns to reassert himself as the OG of South Town.\r\n\r\nIn the King of Fighters continuity, Mr. Big again served as Geese's lackey before eventually turning on him, and he and Geese are in the midst of a gang war in South Town.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Mr.ビッグ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":226877,"created_at":"2025-02-17T11:45:46.161-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T11:45:46.161-05:00","title":"yu_xingyi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["欲星移"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":84322,"created_at":"2017-03-01T07:31:59.214-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T11:38:16.759-05:00","title":"taketatsu_ayana","body":"[[voice actor|Voice actress]].
