Although it has generally declined in real life, it still has many followers and remains popular in various Japanese media, particularily the manga & anime industry.\r\n\r\nIt has many diverse substyles, with some commonalities. Gyaru style typically involves styled and coloured hair, trendy and often sexy gyaru-style clothing (especially from the shops in the mall Shibuya 109), and [[gyaru makeup|heavy makeup]], with a focus on false [[eyelashes]], enlarging the eyes, contouring, and circle lenses. Additionally, many gyaru use the \"gyaru-moji\" (ギャル文字) style of typing and certain specialized slang (ギャル語). There are also certain common hobbies among gyaru: dancing [[Para Para]] was at one time a very popular activity in gyaru circles.\r\n\r\nTwo common elements of gyaru looks, especially in anime and manga representations, are tanned skin ([[ganguro]] - especially for older or throwback styles) and bleached hair. However, not every gyaru has tanned skin or bleached hair, and not every character with tanned skin and bleached hair is a gyaru.\r\n\r\nIn mainstream media, gyaru are usually depicted as either an energeric or an extroverted character, while adult media depicted either as a high-school student [[prostitution|prostitute]] or a character with unusually high sex drive.\r\n\r\nMale [[gyaru]]s are known as [[gyaruo]]. Do not add the gyaruo tag to an [[otoko no ko]] who dresses up as a gyaru.\r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\n* !post #1092131\r\n* !post #7147489\r\n* !post #4188980\r\n* !post #5865647\r\n\r\nh4.

These games make up the [[Touhou (PC-98)]] era. In 2002 he returned as the one-man doujin group [i]Team Shanghai Alice[/i] and released Touhou for Windows, thus exposing it to a larger audience. \r\n\r\nThe games themselves, mostly in the [[danmaku]] (\"bullet hell\") genre, are addictive and have acquired a large following. In particular, his original music is incredibly popular and is the subject of numerous doujin remix albums.\r\n\r\nCurrently Touhou has nineteen mainstream danmaku shooter games, six danmaku spinoffs, six fighting spinoffs and an action spinoff, with the fighting games and action game made in collaboration with Tasogare Frontier. The series also has a number of supplementary materials including manga, short stories, fanbooks, and music CDs.\r\n\r\nThe backgrounds and personalities of its characters (the majority of which come from the Windows generation) are often expanded upon in doujins and, occasionally, ZUN canonizes some concepts. \r\n\r\nTouhou is also notable for being a [i]de facto[/i] open source franchise, in which ZUN allows various fan works such as doujinshi and video games to be published and sold with little to no licensing fees. This allowed the franchise to remain popular to this day.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] Don't tag individual Touhou games unless the game is directly referenced by the post. All of the characters in a picture having debuted in the same game is not enough to count.

The player must assist in solving local issues, managing students, and assisting various schools, while investigating the mystery behind why the GSC president left. Gameplay takes place in a 3D isometric view, but is largely automatic, with player input being limited to triggering \"Skill Cards\" that enable students' special abilities.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with a prologue, and each set with Volumes each. starting from the 1st volume (which is Abydos) until the 5th Volume (which focuses on Hyakkiyako). Main story expansions may update every week or months.\r\n\r\nThe [[Blue Archive the animation|Anime adaptation]] aired on April 7, 2024. The First Season included the Foreclosure Task Force and the Handyman 68, with a major focus of the First Volume in the Game's lore\r\n\r\nBlue Archive also had collaborations outside from the game, including peculiar choice such as [[World of Warships]].\r\n\r\nh4.
