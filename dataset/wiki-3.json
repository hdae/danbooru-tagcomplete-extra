Reckless adventurers came to the city to challenge the demon-infested labyrinths under the city in the hopes of striking it rich.

With heavy focus on the masculine features and appeal of [[mature male|men]]. \r\n\r\nWhile mostly dependent on an artist's personal tastes, the ‘bara’ archetype features 3 main body types:\r\n* Bear-type bodies, (typically tagged as [[plump]] or [[fat]]), are generally softer and rounder looking, with varying degrees of visible musculature.\r\n- Artists: [[Suv (suv032)|]], [[Kuro nezumi inu]], [[Tevit (tevit15)|]].\r\n* Hunks/Jocks or [[muscular|Muscular-type]] bodies, in contrast to the chiseled [[v-taper | triangular look]] of professional bodybuilders, have defined musculature that is usually more proportional overall, similar to that of athletic \"strongman\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongman], with a [[strongman waist|wider waist]] (\"comparison\":[https://cdn.donmai.us/original/e8/4f/e84f5efad6fd9ef1ff268d1982a564d6.jpg]), though the more [[shredded muscles|chiseled]] appearance can be a stylistic choice (see [[Nikism]] for reference).\r\n- Artists: [[Tarutoru]], [[Crow (siranui)|]], [[Dopey (dopq)|]].\r\n* Twunk or otter-type bodies, tagged [[toned]], [i]or[/i] [[muscular]] (especially with younger or sometimes older [[mature male]]s). \r\n- Artists: [[itto_(mentaiko)|Mentaiko]], [[Homri]], [[Torakichi (ebitendon)|]], [[Kuroshinki]]. \r\n\r\nMusculature, when depicted, is typically more exaggerated for emphasis (e.g. [[pectorals|pecs]]) along with the [[bulge]] (implying an exaggerated penis size), and both are usually rather noticeable even when the subject is wearing clothes -  abnormally so. When this exaggeration is paired with the points above, which assert a softer approach when drawing the male form, the 'bara' archetype becomes noticeable.\r\n\r\nCommon masculine features on subjects include: different degrees of [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]] (especially the [[navel hair|happy trail]] leading to [[male pubic hair|pubic hair]]) - or a complete absence of it in the case of younger characters (depending on the artist's tastes), [[thick eyebrows|thick]], [[eyebrow cut|cut]] or [[forked eyebrows|bushy eyebrows]], [[sideburns]], [[buzz cut]], [[large hands]], [[scar]]s, [[tattoo]]s, [[bandaid]]s, [[bandages]], [[wrinkled skin|wrinkles]] (visible with [[mature male|mature]] and [[old man|old]] men), etc.\r\n\r\nAll of these characteristics lend the style a degree of flexibility that allows for further stylization as well as broader cultural mixing between communities; for instance, despite bara’s roots in opposition to them, there is substantial cross-over with the larger [[yaoi|Boys' Love]] community - which can be seen in some artists' styles (E.g [[Yotti]], [[Arima (arima_bn)|]]). It can also be applied to non-human and humanoid characters, such as [[furry male]]s  (E.g [[Wafu (youzora_samo18)|]], [[Boogbogex]]).\r\n\r\n[expand= History and meaning]\r\nThe word \"bara\" literally means \"rose\" in Japanese. The term originally comes from the magazine \"Barazoku\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barazoku], Japan's first gay men's magazine, with the term traditionally referring to more [[bishounen]]-esque men. As a result, the word \"bara\" also began being used as a slang term for any male homoerotic works in general (similar to the use of [[yaoi]] in the West).\r\n\r\nThe word \"bara\" as used here is primarily Western, stemming more from its application on art more commonly known as \"gei komi\", \"gei manga\", or \"mens love\" in Japan, a practice that began on Japanese imageboards, where they intentionally misappropriated the term, this interpretation later being exported abroad. Whilst some Japanese gei komi creators oppose the usage of \"bara\" due to its earlier legacy, others have embraced it. Note that, like most Manga Demographics, bara is commonly defined in terms of the target audience, not the authors or the subject matter.\r\n\r\nBara conceptually often contrasts with yaoi, which is gay male media traditionally made by heterosexual women to appeal to other heterosexual women. Whereas bara is gay/bi male media made by gay/bi men for gay/bi men, that generally features romantic and sexual relationships between [[muscular]] [[mature male|mature men]] and realistic(ish) relationships, often including LGBTQ issues, [[yaoi]] generally features androgynous, idealized, effeminate characters and melodramatic plots devoid of LGBTQ issues (like most [[yuri]], for similar root reasons). By its nature, it is also heteronormative, whether by stereotypically depicting overly emotional relationships or using concepts such as \"uke\" and \"seme,\" and includes themes of homosociality, which contributed more to the clash between fans of the two genres, though nowadays there's a grey area between the two. What they share in common the most though is the fact that non-Japanese audiences have misappropriated them, with yaoi having become a generalized weeb term for anything involving gay men.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4.

He later joined the United States Secret Service, which led to his transfer to the Central Intelligence Agency. In the CIA, Simmons was recruited by Director [[Jason Wynn]] into a special top-secret covert ops division known as the U.S. Security Group, an elite task force with jurisdiction in all domestic and foreign situations.\r\n\r\nJason Wynn (the director of the CIA) and Simmons began to butt heads more often and Simmons planned to resign.\r\n\r\nSimmons was murdered during a mission in [[Botswana]] for the USSG's Operation Knightstrike by fellow mercenary Bruce Stinson (aka Chapel) at the order of Director Wynn.

Despite the name, VTubers are not limited to the [[YouTube]] platform.\r\n\r\nThe term was first popularized by [[Kizuna Ai]], who called herself \"the world's first virtual YouTuber\". Many others followed suit, and the explosion in popularity of the practice lead the term to be used even outside of [[YouTube]], with the Japanese defining VTubers based on the creator declaring themselves as such before considering additional factors.\r\n\r\nMany variations on the term \"VTuber\" exist, including \"Virtual Singer\" / \"VSinger\" (for those that exclusively make music, not be confused with [[VSinger (Vocaloid)|Vocaloid China]]), \"Virtual Liver\" / \"VLiver\", and \"Virtual Streamer\" / \"VStreamer\". In China, the term \"Virtual Uploader\" / \"VUP\" is more commonly used alongside \"VTuber\", after first being coined by [[Xiao Xi]] on [[Bilibili]]. In English, \"PNGTuber\" and \"GIFTuber\" are used to refer to VTubers who use those formats, rather than 3D models or [[Live2D]]. In Japan, \"VLiver\" is also used to refer creators and companies in the 'walled garden app' niche, such as [[IRIAM]] and [[AniLive]], apps which viewers use to watch VTubers who stream exclusively on them.\r\n\r\nThis tag includes anything directly related to VTubers, including [[parody|parodies]], references, fictional VTubers, [[concept art]] of unreleased VTubers, VTuber mascots, and VTuber agency staff members. This tag does not include family members or friends of VTubers, or things merely associated with VTubers.\r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\n* !post #4509699\r\n\r\nh4.

It is one of the first mobile suits to be equipped with a miniaturized Minovsky Flight Unit, making it highly capable of sustaining independent atmospheric flight; and was considered to be a MS that would revolutionize the course of MS operations under gravity.

In addition to the FF unit, it is said that an optional armament known as the Argos Unit was developed, but its details are unknown.

The MS is also capable of supersonic flight by deploying a Beam Barrier in the direction of its movement, but this requires the MS to transform into its Flight Form.\r\n\r\nIts armaments consist of a [[beam rifle]], vulcan guns (mounted on the FF Unit's nose), shoulder-mounted Mega Particle [[beam cannon|Cannons]] (which can also be used as handheld [[energy sword|beam sabers]]), forearm-mounted Composite Weapon Units (a unique weapon that houses a Mega Particle Cannon, a Beam Saber, and missiles in a single unit), and its signature [i]Funnel Missiles[/i], which are [[funnels (gundam)|remote-controlled weapons]] guided by the pilot's Newtype abilities and exploding upon impact.

One example of the physical difference is that the Zeta has a ventless mouthpiece and a white, sharp chin. This head design is also present in some mobile suits of the Project Zeta such as the [[S Gundam]]. The transformation ability and the suit's great speed is its signature quality, as its transformation is fluid and integrated into its combat style often giving it grace unrivaled by most MS. \r\n\r\nThe Zeta Gundam transforms into a fighter-like form called the [[Wave Rider]] Mode. This grants the Zeta not only enhanced speed and mobility, but also the ability to make an atmospheric re-entry from [[space]] on its own without the aid of ballute packs or other external re-entry systems. With the Zeta Gundam's powerful Biosensor activated, the Waverider Mode can be used as a deadly weapon called the [[Waverider Crash]].\r\n\r\nThis mobile suit has many pilots for the record, but is famously known to be designed and piloted by [[Kamille Bidan]] during The Gryps War in [[Zeta Gundam]].

Set in Miami, the series centers on [[Dexter Morgan]] (Michael C. Hall), a forensic technician specializing in blood spatter pattern analysis for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department, who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down murderers who have slipped through the cracks of the justice system. The show's first season was derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first of the Dexter series novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode. Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works.\r\n\r\nThe series later had two sequels and a prequel. [b]Dexter: New Blood[/b], which aired from November 7, 2021 to January 9, 2022 on Showtime, is a miniseries that takes place ten years after the events of the original series, [b]Dexter: Original Sin[/b] a prequel taking place fifteen years before the original series, that aired from December 13, 2024 to February 14, 2025 on Paramount+ before being cancelled, and [b]Dexter: Resurrection[/b], a new series and sequel to New Blood which began airing on July 11, 2025 on Paramount+.\r\n\r\nh4.
