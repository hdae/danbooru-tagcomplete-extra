Personality\r\n\r\nIn-game, she has a generically friendly and reliable personality. She consistently refers to the admiral and other shipgirls as \"Comrades\", conforming to the communist model. In fan-art, the fact that she was built in Italy is rarely shown unless this is directly refered to, often making her the zealous, \"more communist than thou\" character compared to newcomer [[hibiki (kancolle)|Hibiki]]/[[verniy (kancolle)|Verniy]] and imperial-era old guard [[Gangut (kancolle)|]]. On the opposite end, you can have \"the sweetest Tashkent around\":[/pools/14819].\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe Tashkent class of ships consisted of a single destroyer leader, built in Italy for the Soviet navy just before World War II. Three other ships were ordered but canceled before construction. The class is named after Tashkent, \"the capital city\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent] of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (now Uzbekistan).\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nThe real life destroyer Tashkent had a top speed of 43 knots, technically making her faster than [[Shimakaze (destroyer)|]] but slower than the French destroyer [[Le Terrible (destroyer)|Le Terrible]]. With that in mind, she is currently the fastest destroyer implemented in game.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was distributed under the name [b]Super 32X[/b] (スーパー32X [i]Sūpā Sātī Tsu Ekkusu[/i]) in Japan, [b]Sega Genesis 32X[/b] in North America, [b]Sega Mega Drive 32X[/b] in the PAL region, and [b]Sega Mega 32X[/b] in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe 32X was designed to expand the power of the Mega Drive and serve as a holdover until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Mega Drive, the 32X utilizes its own ROM cartridges and had its own library of games. \r\n\r\nUnveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the 32X as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games...\". The product was originally conceived as an entirely new console by [[Sega]] of Japan and positioned as an inexpensive alternative for gamers into the fifth generation of game consoles, but at the suggestion of Sega of America, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Mega Drive and made more powerful, with two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. \r\n\r\nDespite these changes, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the following year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a weak library of titles. With sales only reaching as high as 665,000 units, the 32X is still considered a commercial failure.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スーパー32X"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":225241,"created_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:48.166-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:48.166-05:00","title":"ganesha_(danmachi)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガネーシャ(ダンまち)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":225240,"created_at":"2025-02-08T01:48:38.633-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:48:38.633-05:00","title":"artemis_(danmachi)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アルテミス(ダンまち)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":189158,"created_at":"2024-04-07T08:08:06.092-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:48:33.365-05:00","title":"ooi!_tonbo","body":"Tonbo!

The manga is authored by [[sato masashi|Masashi Satō]], who previously did the artwork for the [[yu-gi-oh!_5d's|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]] manga.\r\nUnlike previous manga spin-offs, OCG Structures manga does not have an anime counterpart; however, characters from the Japan-only Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Saikyo Card Battle make appearances. \r\n\r\nThe manga is based around the real-world OCG rules, as well as set releases. No new card types are introduced, but due to the nature of the manga, any previous type can be the focus of the chapter, based on the Deck the Duelists have built. \r\n\r\nThe series follows [[yusa_shoma|Shoma Yusa]], who moved to a big city from the deep countryside at the invitation of his older sister.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was the first console released in the 16-bit era, albeit still utilizing an 8-bit CPU. Originally intended to \"beat\" the Nintendo [[Famicom]] (which it achieved in Japan), it ended up competing against the likes of the [[Sega Mega Drive]], [[Super Famicom]], and even the [[Neo Geo]] AES.\r\n\r\nThe TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit GPU; and is capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of 14 cm×14 cm×3.8 cm (5.5 in×5.5 in×1.5 in), [b]the NEC PC Engine holds the record for the world's smallest game console ever made[/b].\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, Telegames released a slightly altered version of the American model simply as the TurboGrafx around 1990 in extremely limited quantities. Although there was no full-scale PAL region release of the system, imported PC Engine consoles were largely available in France and Benelux through major retailers thanks to the unlicensed importer Sodipeng (Société de Distribution de la PC Engine, a subsidiary of Guillemot International).\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the PC Engine was very successful. It gained strong third-party support and outsold the Famicom at its 1987 debut, eventually becoming the Super Famicom's main rival. However, the TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and sold poorly, which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing. \r\n\r\nAt least 17 distinct models of the console were made, including portable versions and those that integrated the CD-ROM add-on. An enhanced model, the PC Engine SuperGrafx, was rushed to market in 1989. It featured many performance enhancements and was intended to supersede the standard PC Engine. It failed to catch on—only six titles were released that took advantage of the added power and it was quickly discontinued. The final model was discontinued in 1994. \r\n\r\nTwo major revisions, the [[PC Engine SuperGrafx]] and the PC Engine Duo, were released in 1989 and 1991, respectively.

The RAF was also supported by several squadrons of Polish pilots who escaped to Britain after the conquest of [[Poland]] by Nazi Germany. The British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as [b]the Blitz[/b], that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.\r\n\r\nThe battle ended with a British victory after they regained air superiority over the island. The failure of the Luftwaffe to subdue the UK along with the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union resulted into a cancellation of the planned invasion of Britain, allowing the UK and western allies to refocus their war effort to the North Africa campaign.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["バトル・オブ・ブリテン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":224961,"created_at":"2025-02-06T13:11:44.841-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-06T13:11:44.841-05:00","title":"lotus26","body":"[[AI-generated|AI]] prompter.

In spite of her crippling social anxiety and rampant opposition from the wealthy, she wishes to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor by creating more robust policies in commerce and education, with support from [[Jade_(eversoul)|]]'s Merchants' Guild, the most powerful merchant group in Eden.\r\n\r\nHer associated Artifact is the [i]\"Rhongomyniad\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhongomyniad][/i].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["도미니크","ドミニク"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":224834,"created_at":"2025-02-05T20:45:54.907-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-05T21:21:49.654-05:00","title":"majutsu_tantei_tokisaki_kurumi_no_jikenbo","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Magic_Detective_Kurumi_Tokisaki's_Case_Files","魔術探偵・時崎狂三の事件簿"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":224095,"created_at":"2025-01-31T21:52:59.228-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-05T21:06:45.683-05:00","title":"catherine_(radiance)_(eversoul)","body":"A Chaotic-type Soul from the mobile game [[Eversoul]].

However, as Catherine is a normal Humanlike-type compared to Yuria's more powerful Angel-type, the crown started to consume her very soul, causing a mysterious dark entity to encroach upon her heart and start to corrupt her. Luckily, she was saved because of Rose fusing her own ANIMA into the crown to stabilize her existence. This led to the creation of Eden's first Chaotic-type Soul, giving Catherine the power over sacred flames in tandem with her power to protect others with her shielding magic. However, this also led to Rose's soul becoming trapped within the crown itself, leaving her physical body in a vegetative state.
