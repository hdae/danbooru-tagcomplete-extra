The screenplay was co-written by Kubrick and [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and was partially inspired by Clarke's short story [i]\"The Sentinel\"[/i] (1948). Clarke concurrently wrote the novel [i]2001: A Space Odyssey[/i] during production, which was published soon after the film was released (but contains some differences from the movie's plot). \r\n\r\nThe film is frequently described as an \"epic film\", both for its length and scope, and for its affinity with classical epics. It is notable for its scientific accuracy, pioneering special effects, ambiguous imagery that is open-ended, sound in place of traditional narrative techniques, and minimal use of dialogue.\r\n\r\nDespite initially receiving mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike, 2001: A Space Odyssey garnered a cult following and slowly became a box office hit.

It is an antagonist [[mobile suit]] from [[Gundam Hathaway's Flash]].\r\n\r\nThe [b]RX-104FF Penelope[/b] is a mode of the RX-104 [[Odysseus Gundam]] (i.e., equipped with the FF [Fixed Flight] Unit). It is classified as a 5th generation MS alongside the [[Xi Gundam|RX-105 Xi Gundam]], which was developed around the same time. It is one of the first mobile suits to be equipped with a miniaturized Minovsky Flight Unit, making it highly capable of sustaining independent atmospheric flight; and was considered to be a MS that would revolutionize the course of MS operations under gravity. While the Xi Gundam had a different structure that integrated all of the functions into a single MS, the Penelope Gundam largely depended on the FF Unit. In addition to the FF unit, it is said that an optional armament known as the Argos Unit was developed, but its details are unknown. It is also said to be equipped with a Psycommu or a Quasi-Psycommu unit. The MS is also capable of supersonic flight by deploying a Beam Barrier in the direction of its movement, but this requires the MS to transform into its Flight Form.\r\n\r\nIts armaments consist of a [[beam rifle]], vulcan guns (mounted on the FF Unit's nose), shoulder-mounted Mega Particle [[beam cannon|Cannons]] (which can also be used as handheld [[energy sword|beam sabers]]), forearm-mounted Composite Weapon Units (a unique weapon that houses a Mega Particle Cannon, a Beam Saber, and missiles in a single unit), and its signature [i]Funnel Missiles[/i], which are [[funnels (gundam)|remote-controlled weapons]] guided by the pilot's Newtype abilities and exploding upon impact. These weapons are also equipped on the Xi Gundam.\r\n\r\nIt is piloted by [[Lane Aim]] of the Circe Special Forces unit, and designed in [[real life]] by [[Moriki Yasuhiro]] for the novel; the design was later updated by Fujita Kazumi for the SD Gundam G-Generation series; this updated design has been used for both video games and figures, with [[Katoki Hajime]] giving the design another update for the Fix Figuration line (where its parts can be swapped with the Xi Gundam).","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ペーネロペー","RX-104FF"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205755,"created_at":"2024-08-30T22:43:26.674-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:43:26.674-04:00","title":"alice_kara_mahou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アリスからの魔法"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205754,"created_at":"2024-08-30T22:42:33.876-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:42:33.876-04:00","title":"ageha_100%","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アゲハ100%"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205753,"created_at":"2024-08-30T22:41:39.693-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:41:39.693-04:00","title":"taranta_ranta","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["たらんたランタ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":178042,"created_at":"2023-11-27T19:52:04.034-05:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:39:49.446-04:00","title":"chiikawa_(character)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ちいかわ","ちいかわ(キャラクター)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":179812,"created_at":"2023-12-16T20:48:21.335-05:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:38:37.465-04:00","title":"degwin_sodo_zabi","body":"A fictional character from the [[Gundam]] franchise.

It is said that a Ball, piloted by [[Shiro Amada]], was even capable of defeating a [[Zaku II]] High Mobility Type in one-on-one combat.\r\n\r\nIn [[real life]] its design was inspired by the [[EVA pod]]s from [[2001 A Space Odyssey]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ボール","RB-79"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205744,"created_at":"2024-08-30T22:01:31.924-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:01:31.924-04:00","title":"yuzuki_yuki_(vtuber)","body":"Vtuber\r\n\r\nhttps://x.com/YuzukiYuki123\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@YuzukiCh.123","is_locked":false,"other_names":["柚葵ゆき","ゆずきゃんぱす"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205743,"created_at":"2024-08-30T22:00:58.258-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T22:00:58.258-04:00","title":"nagatachou_strawberry","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["永田町ストロベリィ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205742,"created_at":"2024-08-30T21:58:22.346-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T21:58:22.346-04:00","title":"shinshi_doumei_cross","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["紳士同盟†"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205741,"created_at":"2024-08-30T21:57:49.876-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T21:57:49.876-04:00","title":"star_blacks","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["starblacks","スターブラックス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205740,"created_at":"2024-08-30T21:56:51.303-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T21:57:18.288-04:00","title":"peter_pan_syndrome","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ピーターパン♠症候群","ピーターパン症候群"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205739,"created_at":"2024-08-30T21:55:52.482-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T21:55:52.482-04:00","title":"hayano_chika","body":"Vtuber\r\n\r\nhttps://x.com/furukahichika\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@hayanochika","is_locked":false,"other_names":["はやのちか","ちかじゃらし"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":107864,"created_at":"2019-08-21T10:33:05.928-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T21:27:24.543-04:00","title":"rei_(puyopuyo)","body":"A boy from [[Puyopuyo]].

The Sega CD port received mixed reception from reviewers for being inferior due to the washed out colors, audio balancing issues, low difficulty compared to the original version, instances of sprite flickering and lack of fine-tuning. Retrospective commentary have been positive and is considered one of the most important shooting games on the PC Engine.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ウィンズオブサンダー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205717,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:33:16.343-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:33:16.343-04:00","title":"toui_najimi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["糖衣なじみ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205716,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:27:52.652-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:27:52.652-04:00","title":"division_maneuver","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ディヴィジョンン・マニューバ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205715,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:27:25.915-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:27:25.915-04:00","title":"suzuka_hanabi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["鈴鹿花火"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205712,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:14:52.767-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:14:52.767-04:00","title":"guiding_hand","body":"A character that is coaxingly guiding another's hand towards a specific place - including parts of the body.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205711,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:08:17.446-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:08:17.446-04:00","title":"lilia_(madou_shoujo_ni_tensei_shita_ore_no_souken_ga_yuunou_sugiru)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["リリア(魔導少女)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205710,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:07:54.841-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:07:54.841-04:00","title":"yuuto_(madou_shoujo_ni_tensei_shita_ore_no_souken_ga_yuunou_sugiru)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["勇翔(魔導少女)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205707,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:05:09.292-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:07:17.292-04:00","title":"getsuka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["月華(魔導少女)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205708,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:06:11.920-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:07:06.846-04:00","title":"haruna_(madou_shoujo_ni_tensei_shita_ore_no_souken_ga_yuunou_sugiru)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["陽奈(魔導少女)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205709,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:06:52.511-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:06:52.511-04:00","title":"noel_(madou_shoujo_ni_tensei_shita_ore_no_souken_ga_yuunou_sugiru)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ノエル(魔導少女)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205705,"created_at":"2024-08-30T16:01:00.663-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-30T16:06:16.019-04:00","title":"niwa_(genshin_impact)","body":"Hisahide Niwa is a character from [[Genshin Impact]].

Asuka is intense and brooding, and trying to find her identity like many other 14-year-olds. She can be summed up as a [[chuunibyou]], but unlike [[Kanzaki Ranko|Ranko]] (who she is often associated with by fans), Asuka is decidedly more of the cool or subcultural type. Asuka is very self-aware, and asks the Producer to cut her some slack if she's unpleasant at times because she's dealing with puberty. While she is initially an enemy to the Cinderella Girls cast, she later joins them and is available to produce.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Asuka is introduced by [[Makihara Shiho]]. She believes love and peace to be the same in principle, as only those who believe in them have them. Her views of mystical or paranormal objects are that she doesn’t think that they can exist outside of a person’s imagination. She does not like black coffee and thinks that the aura of the office roof is heartwarming.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 9th set of CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Igarashi Kyoko]], [[Ohtsuki Yui]], [[Nakano Yuka]], and [[Aiba Yumi]]. She is voiced by [[Aoki Shiki]] [青木 志貴]. \r\n\r\nh4.

The game was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2017 and was especially notable for the actresses who play the leaders of title groups µ's and Aqours ([[Nitta Emi]] and [[Inami Anju]]) sharing a stage for the first time, which foreshadowed the members of µ's and Aqours interacting for the first time as part of the game's storyline.\r\n\r\nThe main cast includes not only all 18 combined members of µ's and Aqours but also marks the debut of the original nine members of the [[Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club|Nijigasaki High School Idol Club]], including three members who had previously appeared as Normal-rarity characters in [i]LL: SIF[/i] and won a popularity poll. The nine new members' actresses were also announced at TGS 2017. [[Mifune Shioriko]], [[Zhong Lanzhu]] and [[Mia Taylor]] also initially appeared in this game as rival characters before joining Nijigasaki.\r\n\r\nIn a break with the anime premise, [i]All Stars[/i] has both µ's, Aqours and Nijigasaki in high school at the same time and includes interactions between members of all three groups as part of the story. Other features include fully rendered dances, skill tree development and features to recognize players who had already been playing [i]LL: SIF[/i] using SIF IDs.\r\n\r\nGame service ended on June 30, 2023.

The game's storyline involves a fictional conflict in the Middle East and [[Russia]], where players take on the roles of different characters in the single-player campaign.\r\n\r\nThe game gained widespread praise for its engaging and cinematic single-player campaign, which presented a more realistic and gritty portrayal of modern warfare. It also introduced iconic characters like [[Captain Price]] and introduced the popular character-based storytelling approach to the franchise.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the game's multiplayer component was a major success, introducing a leveling system, customizable loadouts, and various game modes that became highly influential in the FPS genre.

Deciding whether to add commentary\r\n\r\nCommentaries should always be added to posts when they are available. When using the \"upload bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], commentary will automatically be fetched from supported sites. For unsupported sites, it will have to be copied over manually.\r\n\r\nh4. Adding the artist's commentary\r\n\r\nYou can add or edit information in these fields by viewing a post and then clicking the [b]Add commentary[/b] link in the sidebar. A dialog with four fields will appear. Original title and Original description should have the artist's original commentary, regardless of the language it's in. Commentary can automatically be fetched from the source link or another external link, or copied from another post altogether.\r\n\r\nAll posts with commentary should be tagged with [[commentary]] or [[commentary request]], as well as the language of the commentary, if it is not in Japanese.\r\n\r\nIf the artist has also posted any interesting tags, these can be listed at the bottom of the commentary field (e.g. post #2519177).\r\n\r\nh4. Commentaries from multiple sources\r\n\r\nOften, an artist will post a particular picture at [[multiple sources]], using a different commentary for each source. \r\n\r\nIn those cases, use the [b]h4[/b] dtext tag for source headings, [b]h5[/b] for titles, and everything goes in the body.  Additionally, use textile links on the sources pointing to the original source material for the comment ([[help:dtext]]). Using the \"Fetch\" option in the commentary form will automatically fill this out for you.\r\n\r\nSee post #2387146 for an example of this in action.\r\n\r\nh4. Translating the artist's commentary\r\n\r\nTranslations of the commentary can be placed in the Translated title and Translated description fields in the [b]Add artist commentary[/b] dialog.\r\n\r\nOnce all relevant parts of the commentary are translated into English, the [[commentary request]] tag should be removed and replaced with the [[commentary]] tag. If you are unsure of the translation, add the [[check commentary]] tag.\r\n\r\nh4. Commentary formatting\r\n\r\nSee [[help:dtext]] for help with formatting commentary. Note that DText does not work in commentary titles, only the description.\r\n\r\nSee [[howto:translate]] and [[howto:romanize]] for further policies on translations.\r\n\r\nh4.
