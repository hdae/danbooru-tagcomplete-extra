The series consists of 4 TV seasons with a theatrical film set at the midpoint, as well as two companion comic runs by [[Marvel]] - one produced in the US, and the other in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe G1 TV cartoon is notable because it was made in an 80s [[mecha]] anime style.

The [[Marvel]] [[comic]]s company also contributed to the original franchise by developing the whole fictional Generation 1 universe of the TV series and its robot characters info and backgrounds, all created by Marvel comics writer \"Bob Budiansky\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Budiansky. \r\n\r\nThe [b]Transformers: Generation 1[/b] tag is for the original series and supplementary media only.

[i]Trigger[/i] later began streaming the short with English subtitles on YouTube from April 19, 2013.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 2013, Trigger announced at [[Anime Expo]] that a new episode, tentatively titled [i][b]Little Witch Academia 2[/b][/i], would be developed in response to the reception the first episode received. The project will begin production in late 2013 following the airing of [[Kill la Kill]], with a goal to release it for winter 2014. Whilst initially having the funds for a twenty minute episode, Trigger launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to extend its runtime by fifteen minutes. The Kickstarter was launched on July 9, 2013 and met its $150,000 goal within five hours. A stretch goal of $500,000 was added to produce a making of documentary and audio commentary for the Bluray release. The Kickstarter raised a total of $625,518. Ootsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full length film. A television series was eventually made for the series in Winter 2017, and was premiered on Netflix.\r\n\r\nh4.

The game is notably very popular in Japan, where first-person shooters typically have difficulty finding a large following.

leader of [[Malawi]] from 1961 to 1994.\r\n\r\n After receiving much of his education overseas, Banda returned to his home country (then British Nyasaland) to speak against colonialism and advocate independence. In 1963 he was formally appointed prime minister of Nyasaland and, a year later, led the country to independence as Malawi. Two years later he proclaimed Malawi a republic with himself as president. He consolidated power and later declared Malawi a one-party state under the [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP). In 1970 the MCP made him the party's President for Life. In 1971 he became President for Life of Malawi itself.\r\n\r\nAs a leader of the pro-Western bloc in Africa he received support from the West during the [[Cold War]]. He generally supported women's rights, improved the country's infrastructure and maintained a good educational system relative to other African countries but also presided over one of the most repressive regimes in Africa. His government regularly tortured and murdered political opponents. Human rights groups estimate that at least 6,000 people were killed, tortured and jailed without trial. As many as 18,000 people were killed during his rule according to one estimate. He was scorned for maintaining full diplomatic relations with apartheid-era [[South Africa]].\r\n\r\nBy 1993 he was facing international pressure and widespread protest. A referendum ended his one-party state and a special assembly ended his life-term presidency, stripping him of most of his powers. Banda ran for president in the democratic elections which followed and was defeated. He died in South Africa in 1997.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヘイスティングズ・カムズ・バンダ","ヘイスティングズ・バンダ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":90925,"created_at":"2017-10-09T19:24:41.456-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-01T16:09:18.093-04:00","title":"saddam_hussein","body":"[b]Saddam Hussein[/b] was the President of [[Iraq]] from 1979 to 2003.\r\n\r\nh4.
