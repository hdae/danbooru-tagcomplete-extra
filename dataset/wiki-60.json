Her artist tweeted that her hair flaps were to reflect her \"ferocious hound\"-like history during her final battle. While the historical Yuudachi was indeed present during the battle, the name \"Nightmare of Solomon\" was the name US Marines stationed on Guadalcanal christened a night bombardment - a night bombardment that Yuudachi did not participate in.\r\n\r\nh4.

Appearance and personality\r\n[[aoba_(kancolle)|Much like her KanColle counterpart]], AZL's Aoba is a reporter (a reference to the novelist-journalist Unno Juuza, who served aboard Aoba during the war), and she regularly comments about getting the latest scoop about the naval base. However, her lines have her trending the line towards stalker/paparazzi, with one of her secretary lines contemplating making up stories (in response to an apparent lack of 'good news') and her default affection line possibly serving as a 4th wall break, commenting on the game's harem subtext; in contrast, her KanColle counterpart only displays such tendencies in fanworks.\r\n\r\nAppearance-wise, Aoba has animal ears (though a tail is only shown in her emotes, and she has human ears as well), with turquoise hair, a violet blazer with purple accents worn over a black tank top (with [[medium_breasts|some cleavage]] exposed), and a white skirt with a blue line at the base of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

Aoba was originally to be the third ship of the [i]Furutaka[/i]-class, but redesigns caused her to become a new class, featuring larger guns and an extended flight deck, and as the more updated design, she was made the flagship. She served in numerous naval battles like Coral Sea, Savo Island, Cape Esperance, and Leyte Gulf before she was sunk in an air raid in Kure in 1945 and scrapped a year later.\r\n\r\nh4.

The Yugo-era cars were notably designed by Zastava with Fiat support, as opposed to purely being adapted Fiat designs. These would be the [[Zastava Yugo]] (the famous one), the [[Zastava Skala]] (Yugo Skala), and Zastava Florida (Yugo Florida).\r\n\r\nFollowing the 1990s, Zastava went into decline, and shut down in 2008.

She participated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] by escorting neutral shipping, but did little during World War II. After ferrying aircraft to Africa, and being damaged in a British raid on \"Mers-El-Kebir,\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mers_El_K%C3%A9bir], the Vichy French scuttled [i]Commandant Teste[/i] in 1942 to prevent her from being captured by the Germans. The Italians managed to bring her back up in 1943, and passed her to the Germans, but [i]Commandant Teste[/i] was sunk again by aerial bombing nearly a year after that. Although raised one last time after the war, there was no use seen for her, and she was sold for scrap in 1950.\r\n\r\nHer [[abyssal ship|abyssal]] form is assumed to be the [[Seaplane Tender Water Princess]].\r\n\r\nh4.
