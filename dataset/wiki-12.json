The film received a theatrical 3D re-release in 2013, and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Crichton's 1995 sequel novel, The Lost World, was followed by a 1997 film adaptation, also directed by Spielberg.

And Hammond's invited guests to this soft opening — paleontologist [[Alan Grant]], paleobotanist [[Ellie Sattler (Jurassic park)|]], chaotician [[Ian Malcolm]], lawyer Donald Gennaro and Hammond's own grandchildren Tim and Lex Murphy — are caught in the middle of it all.\r\n\r\nH4.

Quebec French (also known as Québécois) is the predominant variety, having some differences (primarily in pronunciations and vocabulary) when compared to European French. \r\n\r\nThe province was settled by Paleo-Indians during the Last Glacial Maximum and was first explored by Europeans under Jacques Cartier in 1534, who would claim it for the Kingdom of France. France would continue to hold on to the colony until 1763, when ownership of the colony was transferred to the United Kingdom after the French and Indian War (AKA the Seven Years' War). It would later join the Dominion of Canada in 1867. In 1960, the Quiet Revolution would achieve major reforms throughout the province.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Québec is Québec City (French: Ville de Québec) and the largest cities are [[Montreal|Montréal]], Gatineau, Trois-Rivières, and Sherbrooke. \r\n\r\nQuébec is the birthplace of [[poutine]] and is known for helping to popularize the sport of [[ice hockey]].\r\n\r\nh4.

She wears a grey thigh-length [[sleeveless]] and skirted [[wetsuit]] with green accents. Her garb changes with each remodel: As [[uit-25 (kancolle)|U.IT.25]] (or \"Ui\"), she gains [[arm warmers]], red, white, and black shoulder pads, and a black hairband. Then, upon becoming [[i-504 (kancolle)|I-504]] (or \"Go\"), she reverts to her white hairband, but is otherwise reduced to nothing else but a [[white one-piece swimsuit|white]] [[school swimsuit]]. Despite the changes in wardrobe, her standard submarine [[machinery]], with its grey and green livery, mostly stays the same.\r\n\r\nLuigi Torelli has the unique distinction in the game as the shipgirl to serve all three Axis powers, representing one of the two ships that ever did so (the other being another Italian submarine [[Comandante Cappellini (kancolle)|]]). The historical submarine originally patrolled the Mediterranean Sea, sinking and damaging Greek and British commercial ships before surviving an attack by Vickers Wellington bombers using Leigh light on June 3, 1942. Due to her dimensions, she was deemed fit for long travels and thus was among seven submarines sent to the Far East in 1943, retaining her Italian crew despite being under Kriegsmarine command. After the new Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies the same year, the historal [i]Luigi Torelli[/i] was passed to full German command under the name [i]U.IT.25[/i] and took part in German war operations in the Pacific. After Germany's surrender in 1945, ex-[i]Luigi Torelli[/i]'s IJN custodians then took over control, renaming her [i]I-504[/i]. She was under the Japanese flag when she shot down a B-25 Mitchell bomber near the very end of the World War II in the Pacific, allegedly the last Axis naval success. She was captured by American forces in Kobe at the conclusion of the war and eventually scuttled by the US Navy in the Kii Channel on April 16, 1946.\r\n\r\nh4.

She has a loving infatuation with - and at least as of [[Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves]], is engaged to - fellow Shiranui-ryuu practitioner [[Andy Bogard]], whom she trained with at a relatively young age and she came to see as a good man (though she tended to move the relationship a little too quickly for Andy's liking). As of [[Garou: Mark of the Wolves]], she and Andy both train a young Shiranui-ryuu disciple named [[Hokutomaru]]. She is good friends with most of the rest of the Fatal Fury roster, not least of which includes Andy's brother [[Terry Bogard|Terry]] and best friend [[Joe Higashi]]. In The King of Fighters, she is a founding member of the Women Fighters Team alongside [[King (SNK)|]] and [[Yuri Sakazaki]].\r\n\r\nMai is one of SNK's most popular characters, appearing in numerous cross-overs and promotions. Her oldest and arguably greatest cross-company rival is [[Capcom]]'s [[Street Fighter]]'s [[Chun-Li]].

Ultimate]], since she would be challenging the game's [[CERO]] rating of A; the way Sakurai put it in the announcement (\"[[Smash is for good boys and girls]]\") was turned into a meme. She received a new outfit with her appearance in [[Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves]]. The [[tank top]] and [[short shorts]]/[[dolphin shorts]] casualwear/nightwear she wore in her [[SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy|SNK Heroines]] ending, previously referenced in her and Andy's Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 endings, makes a cameo appearance as part of her character select animation in [[Street Fighter 6]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Despite the name, content is not limited to [[YouTube]], and often, a VTuber is someone who declares themselves as such.\r\n\r\nThe term was first popularized by [[Kizuna Ai]], who called herself \"the world's first virtual YouTuber\". Many others followed suit, and the explosion in popularity of the practice lead the term to be used even outside of [[YouTube]], though variations on the term have been introduced as to diminish the use of the brand name, including \"VTuber\", \"Virtual Singer\"/\"VSinger\" (for those that exclusively do music, not be confused with [[VSinger (Vocaloid)|Vocaloid China]]), and \"Virtual Liver\"/\"VLiver\" (specifically referring to virtual streamers) or \"Virtual Streamer\"/\"VStreamer\" (due to the former term reminding folks of the organ in English). In Chinese, the term \"Virtual Uploader\"/\"VUP\" is used more commonly alongside \"VTuber\", after being first coined by [[Xiao Xi]] on [[Bilibili]]. In English, terms such as \"PNGTuber\" and \"GIFTuber\" also exist to refer to VTubers whose models use those formats, now that they are no longer the norm among indies (that had no access to 3D models back in the day). In Japan, the term \"VLiver\" is also used to refer creators and companies in the 'walled garden app' niche, such as [[IRIAM]] and [[AniLive]], apps which viewers use to watch VTubers who stream exclusively on them.\r\n\r\nThis tag should apply to not only virtual YouTubers themselves, but also to [[parody|parodies]] of virtual YouTubers, references to them, fictitious virtual YouTubers, fake virtual YouTubers, and concept art that ultimately isn't used (for the latter three, [code]original[/code] should be used). While tagging mascots and staff with the tag is fine, family members and friends of VTubers don't apply, unless they too are VTubers, nor do things merely associated with VTubers.\r\n\r\nh4.
