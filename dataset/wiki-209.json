tomboyish karate practitioner with dreams of becoming a vale tudo champion, Tatsuki seems to possess no excessively feminine qualities as is typical of female manga characters. However, she does spell her name using hiragana (たつき), which she thinks looks feminine, because she thinks the kanji of her name looks un-cute.\r\n\r\nShe is protective of Orihime because men looking for a date—to say nothing of Chizuru Honshō, the school lesbian—often approach Orihime. She is an expert martial artist that places high in Japan's national karate competitions, coming in second in her age group even though she had a broken arm at the time.

As [[Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen]] is also a member of this squadron, the two are fellow squadron members.\r\n\r\nNikka is something of a tomboy, bearing a boyish appearance and often unladylike manner. She was once something of a delinquent, which has since eased somewhat with the influence of her close friends such as Eila and [[Hanna Wind]]. She possesses a very exacting personality which usually splits any situation into right or wrong. While not stupid, she is relatively guileless and often distracted, making her a popular subject for Eila's pranks.\r\n\r\nNikka is based on the Finnish flying ace Nils Katajainen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Katajainen ). Like Nikka, Nils had a reputation for frequently crashing his craft, often surviving with only minor injuries. Her nickname, \"Nipa,\" was also Nils' nickname during the war.

Because her body can't handle the high-speed maneuvers of dog fighting for an extended period of time it was necessary for her to learn a style that married careful observation of the target to a single decisive blow and follow-through escape. This talent has lead to her being a valued instructor and strategist despite a low confirmed kill count.\r\n\r\nPossibly metaphorical, references are made to her \"true form\" surfacing, as if she never developed her condition. Part of this form is her familiar upgrading to the [[kyuubi]], or nine-tailed, ascendant spirit foxes of Japanese mythology.\r\n\r\nHer Pilot archetype is Edmund Roßmann. According to her profile in SWII Vol. 3's booklet, her nickname \"Paula\" is based on the Latin \"Paulus,\" meaning \"small.\" (This also parallels Edmund Roßmann's nickname of \"Paule,\" a male variant.)

She is moderately busty but wears tight clothing that hides this; a reference to the G3's slim but heavy handgaurd. Unlike most of the other students at her academy, she wears an entirely black and grey uniform except for a large red bow placed on her breast (a reference to the G3's all black finish). She (and her sisters) are also one of the only characters in Upotte to wear pantyhose, a reference to her fairly unique looking plastic stock. \r\n\r\nJiisuri is normally very calm, somewhat aloof and competitive. The eldest of her sisters, she oversees and \"parents\" all of them to an extent. These qualities attracted Farru (FN FAL), another battle rifle who is much like Jiisuri in many ways, and the two share a close friendship and are often allied in school competitions. She is also fairly close with M14, another battle rile, and Funnco (FN FNC), an assault rifle and the main character of Upotte.\r\n\r\nWhile Jiisuri is normally fairly calm and mature, she is a bit of a blushing housewife at heart, as revealed though her interactions with teachers at her school and with the manga's readers (Upotte's artist likes to add 4koma style strips at the end of certain chapters, where questions submitted by the readers are answered by the Upotte cast.) Jiisuri in her appearances is open, friendly, somewhat skittish and oddly flirtatious. She even poses for a personal, rather lewd personal photo shot as  part of a popularity poll.\r\n\r\nJiisuri is also one of the most popular Upottes; she won the first \"Shounen ace Upotte popularity poll,\" trumping all the other characters.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":78350,"created_at":"2016-07-28T03:32:32.957-04:00","updated_at":"2016-07-28T03:32:32.957-04:00","title":"gokkun_vampire_princess","body":"2015 eroge by developer [[WendyBell]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":78336,"created_at":"2016-07-27T23:50:09.790-04:00","updated_at":"2016-07-27T23:50:09.790-04:00","title":"chiaki_kurihara","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["チアキ・クリハラ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":78330,"created_at":"2016-07-27T23:35:12.604-04:00","updated_at":"2016-07-27T23:35:12.604-04:00","title":"uehara_haruka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["上原はるか"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":78328,"created_at":"2016-07-27T21:55:12.946-04:00","updated_at":"2016-07-27T21:56:49.802-04:00","title":"alfendi_layton","body":"The protagonist of the [i][[Professor Layton]][/i] spinoff [i][[Layton Brothers: Mystery Room]][/i].
