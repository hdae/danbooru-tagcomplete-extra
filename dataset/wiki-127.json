For example, for Twitter and Pixiv you can paste a link to the tweet or Pixiv post, rather than a link to the image itself.\r\n\r\nWhen uploading files from your computer, it's possible to upload multiple files at once by selecting them all in the file picker window.

If you hit your upload limit, you have to wait until your uploads are either approved or deleted in three days before you can upload again.\r\n\r\nYour upload limit goes up as your uploads are approved, and goes down if your uploads are deleted. When you first start, you need 10 approvals for your upload limit to go up. Every time your limit goes up, you need 2 more approvals to get to the next level. Your limit will go down after every 3 deletions.\r\n\r\nSee [[about:upload limits]] for more details.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How does the moderation system work?]\r\n\r\nAll new uploads go through a moderation queue, where they're reviewed by a team of approvers. Posts have three days to be approved. If they're not approved by anyone in three days, then they're deleted.\r\n\r\nAll it takes is a single approver liking a post for it to be approved. Posts are only deleted if every approver who sees it doesn't think it's good enough to be approved. Most posts are deleted because multiple approvers saw it and none of them thought it met Danbooru's standards.\r\n\r\nUsually there are around 10 to 15 active approvers at any given time. \r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=Why did my upload get deleted?]\r\n\r\nUsually because it didn't meet Danbooru's quality standards. You can ask for feedback in the \"Upload feedback thread\":/forum_topics/7934 if you're not sure why something was deleted. Keep in mind there often isn't much to say beyond \"it wasn't very good\".\r\n\r\nIf you think your post was unfairly deleted, you can appeal it. Go to the deleted post, then click the \"Appeal\" button in the sidebar. This will put it back in the moderation queue for another three days, where it has another chance to be approved.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that if you appeal something immediately after it was deleted, it will probably be seen by the same people who passed over it the first time. Waiting a few days can improve your odds.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=I don't like the moderation system]\r\n\r\nDeleted posts can still be seen by everyone. They're simply filtered out of searches by default. To see deleted posts, add {{is:deleted}} to your searches or click the \"Deleted\" button in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nIf you want to always see deleted posts, you can go to your \"account settings\":/settings and enable the \"Show deleted posts\" option. This lets you effectively ignore the moderation system.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4.

To remove a tag, simply delete the tag from the Tags box. Click the \"Submit\" button when you're done. \r\n\r\nAnyone can add or remove tags on a post. You don't need any special privileges. All you need is to \"create an account\":/users/new first.\r\n\r\nTip: you can press \"Shift+E\" to quickly open the tag edit box in a window, and \"Ctrl+Enter\" to save the tags when you're done.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I make a new character or copyright tag?]\r\n\r\nTag the post with [code]character:character_name_here[/code] or [code]copyright:copyright_name_here[/code].

Give a reason for the request in the \"Reason\" box.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new forum thread where other users can discuss and vote on your request. An admin must approve your request for it to go through. Look at other threads to get a feel for how to write your request.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a tag alias?]\r\n\r\nAn alias is an alternate name for a tag. For example, [[yellow hair]] is aliased to [[blonde hair]] because yellow hair is the same thing as blonde hair. Searching for [[yellow hair]] will automatically redirect you to [[blonde hair]]. Tagging a post with [[yellow hair]] will automatically add [[blonde hair]] instead.\r\n\r\nAn alias is used when two tags mean the same thing, or when there are multiple words people might use for the same concept.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a tag implication?]\r\n\r\nAn implication is when one tag automatically adds another tag. For example, the [[white shirt]] tag implies [[shirt]] because a white shirt is a type of shirt. Tagging a post with [[white shirt]] will automatically add the [[shirt]] tag too.\r\n\r\nAn implication is used when adding one tag should always add another.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I request that a tag be renamed?]\r\nGo to the forum, click \"Request alias/implication\":/bulk_update_requests/new at the top of the page, then write [code]alias old_tag_name -> new_tag_name[/code] in the \"Request\" box. Give a reason for the request in the \"Reason\" box.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new forum thread where other users can discuss and vote on your request. An admin must approve your request for it to go through. Look at other threads to get a feel for how to write your request.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I request a tag alias or implication?]\r\n\r\nGo to the forum, click \"Request alias/implication\":/bulk_update_requests/new at the top of the page, then write [code]alias old_tag_name -> new_tag_name[/code] or [code]imply tag1 -> tag2[/code] in the \"Request\" box. Give a reason for the request in the \"Reason\" box.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new forum thread where other users can discuss and vote on your request. An admin must approve your request for it to go through. Look at other threads to get a feel for how to write your request.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a deprecated tag?]\r\n\r\nA deprecated tag is a tag that can't be added to new posts. Tags are deprecated when it's decided they should no longer be used, usually because they're too ambiguous, or there are other better tags available.\r\n\r\nFor example, [[case]] is deprecated because it could mean a [[suitcase]], a [[guitar case]], a [[CD case]], or some other type of case. The [[case]] tag is deprecated to prevent people from still using it.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a tag qualifier?]\r\n\r\nA tag qualifier is a word in parentheses at the end of the tag, to disambiguate it from other tags with the same name. For example, in [[arrow (projectile)]] the qualifier is \"projectile\", to distinguish it from [[arrow (symbol)]].\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a copyright tag?]\r\n\r\nA copyright tag is a tag for a game, anime, manga, book, movie, or any other kind of fictional universe or property. In general, copyright tags are for things with characters. They're called copyright tags for lack of a better name. Copyright tags are colored purple.\r\n\r\nCopyright tags aren't for brand names, company names, trademarks, or other things without characters.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4. Users\r\n\r\n[expand=What are the different user levels?]\r\n\r\nRegular users are called Members. Members have blue names.\r\n\r\nBuilders have purple names. Builders are people who have been promoted for contributing a lot to the site.\r\n\r\nContributors also have purple names. Contributors are uploaders who have been promoted for uploading a lot of high quality posts to the site. Contributors have no upload limits and are allowed to bypass the moderation queue.\r\n\r\nApprovers also have purple names.

The manga would see renewed interest in the 90s, as a source of knowledge for readers contextualizing the then-ongoing Yugoslav Wars.\r\n\r\nEditions of the manga after the 80s Ushio Publishing releases (ex. Shinchosha) would feature extensive redraws, which has some fans split. The 2022 Kadokawa-published editions, based on the Shinchosha editions, would feature as a bonus two earlier chapters made by Sakaguchi adapting the 1969 Yugoslav film '\"Krvava bajka\":[https://www.filmneweurope.com/news/serbia-news/item/123557-serbian-classic-sold-for-comic-book-adaptation-in-japan]', published in the August and September 1970 issues of Manga-Ou, which are considered the origin of Ishi no Hana's eventual creation.

The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the [[Sturmgeschutz IV]] assault gun, [[Jagdpanzer IV]] tank destroyer, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon, and the Brummbär self-propelled gun.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was intended to fight other armored fighting vehicles and serve alongside the infantry-supporting [[Panzer IV]]. However, as the Germans faced the formidable [[T-34]], stronger anti-tank guns were needed. The Panzer IV had a bigger turret ring and so the roles were reversed. The Panzer IV mounted the long barreled 7.5 cm KwK 40 gun and engaged in tank-to-tank battles. The Panzer III became obsolete in this role and for most purposes was supplanted by the Panzer IV. From 1942, the last version of Panzer III mounted the 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24, better suited for infantry support.\r\n\r\nProduction of the Panzer III ended in 1943.

First introduced in the PC RTS game [[Dawn of War]], the chapter have since appeared in both the tabletop and other 40k games as well. The chapter is known from their red armor and their emblem, a raven with a blood drop on its chest.\r\n\r\nWhile generally well received amongst (most of) the Imperium for their protective nature over civilians and eagerness to deal death to the enemies of the Imperium, the Techpriests of Mars and the Inquisition due to their voracious appetite for knowledge, learning and artifacts in particular, the Blood Ravens have a mixed reputation amongst the other Space Marine chapters due to both their strategies (favoring extensive recon, meticulous planning and pinpoint assaults on key enemy vulnerabilities) and their Chapter-wide tendency to produce almost unprecedented numbers of psykers and Librarians. The Space Wolves (who favor strategies involving charges and overwhelming the foe in massed melee) infamously do not tolerate Blood Raven procedures at all, with physical altercations being recorded between the two chapters at command-level meetings.\r\n\r\nAs a second-founding chapter with no official records prior to M37K, the Blood Ravens do not (again officially) have a recognizable Primarch. However, their color scheme, tendency to produce psykers and culture surrounding the acquisition of knowledge strongly suggest that they are descendants of [[Magnus the Red]], making them loyalists of the [[Thousand Sons]] traitor legion. This would also make them an indirect relative chapter of the [[Grey Knight]]s due to sharing a Founder in Janus.\r\n\r\nAs the Blood Raven arsenal contains some phenomenally unlikely artifacts (Gear belonging to the Custodes and [i]Primarchs[/i] to name but a few) that would have been under enough security to make their theft near impossible, the Blood Ravens gained the fandom reputation of being able to perform implausible acts of indefinite borrowing, such as swapping places with a Land Raider's driver while he's still inside the cockpit, acquiring Bjorn the Fell-handed's Dreadnaught for combat use (with Bjorn catching on quickly to his new circumstances and happily embracing the chance to go back to war) and involuntarily renting the Golden Throne of Terra. \r\n\r\nThe chapter have been jokingly called \"The Bloody Magpies\" by fans due to how the chapter are constantly gifted (or 'gifted', due to those same chapters not having any records stating that they ever gave the Ravens anything)  rare, powerful weapons and gear from other older chapters.  \r\nDue to their memetic shenanigans, gateway status to the 40k world and generally being a interesting chapter, the Blood Ravens are well-regarded amongst the fandom - even if the jokes about rampant theft get a little repetitive.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174176,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:37.940-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:37.940-04:00","title":"hiraga_raizou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["平賀雷蔵"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174175,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:13.627-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:13.627-04:00","title":"suzukaze_miharu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["涼風美晴"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174174,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:42:52.208-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:42:52.208-04:00","title":"candy_&_cigarettes","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キャンディ&シガレッツ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":148110,"created_at":"2022-08-06T18:58:17.855-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T12:18:33.479-04:00","title":"ariel_(yu-gi-oh!)","body":"An umbrella tag for variations of the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] [[duel monster]] Gishki Ariel who was originally printed in 2011 and has received new forms throughout the years. \r\n\r\nh4.
