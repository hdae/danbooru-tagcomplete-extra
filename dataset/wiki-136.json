Breaking all of the locks will remove the chains and allow players to progress in the story.\r\n\r\nBlack Psyche-Locks are strictly a story element, and are much rarer throughout the franchise. These locks appear when a character is hiding a secret that they themselves don’t know about, typically as a result of a traumatic incident or from a character’s own deranged personality.
