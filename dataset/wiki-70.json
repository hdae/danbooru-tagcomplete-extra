Often as they'd be seen during their respective games.\r\n** Fallen: Refers to Heroes as corrupted versions of their regular selves. The game treats them as regular Heroes for many purposes.\r\n** Brave: Refers to Heroes as idealized versions of themselves manifested by the imagination of the people. Determined each year by voting, their appearance, personality and weapons vary greatly.

It is a member of the long-necked lute family, with a round body with a flat top and a long neck with a fretted fingerboard. It has steel strings and is played with a [[plectrum]] producing a sharp metallic sound, reminiscent of a [[mandolin]] but pitched lower. There are two main types of bouzouki: the trichordo (three-course) has three pairs of strings (known as courses) and the tetrachordo (four-course) has four pairs of strings. The instrument was brought to Greece in the early 1900s by Greek immigrants from Anatolia, and quickly became the central instrument to the rebetiko genre and its music branches. It is now an important element of modern Laïko pop Greek music.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ブズーキ","μπουζούκι","μπουζούκια"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":91728,"created_at":"2017-10-31T16:18:41.748-04:00","updated_at":"2024-03-21T23:44:56.694-04:00","title":"bulgaria","body":"A Slavic country in southeast Europe.

The official anime released in 2017, followed by a second season in 2019. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay is heavily reliant on the player's summons and weapons obtained from the gacha system and from in-game raids. The player can equip a maximum of ten weapons and five summons at a time and this is generally referred to as the \"weapon grid\" and \"summon pool\".\r\n\r\nGranblue is infamous for its competitive week-long event (Guild Wars/Unite & Fight/古戦場) where players farm chunks of meat and try to score more points than their opponent crew for hours at a time. Art is occasionally drawn depicting this in game event, one example being [[post guild war celebration]]s.\r\n\r\nh4. Races\r\n\r\nMost characters in Granblue Fantasy are divided into 5 races. \r\n\r\n* Human. Most characters fall into this.\r\n* [[Erune]], whose notable features are their animal ears and clothing that expose their backs.\r\n* [[Harvin]], dwarf sized humanoids.\r\n* [[Draph]], humanoids with prominent horns on their heads. Males are tall and muscular, while females are noticeably shorter than the average person, while having big breasts.\r\n* Primal. Primal beasts are creatures that were crafted by the Astral beings long ago. A good number of them (usually humanoid) end up joining the player's crew for one reason or another. \r\n\r\nh4. Protagonist\r\n\r\nThe player is represented by either [[Gran_(granblue_fantasy)|]] or [[Djeeta_(granblue_fantasy)|]] based on their gender selection and this can be changed at any time. The player may also change their class at any time which also changes their costume.\r\n\r\nh4.
