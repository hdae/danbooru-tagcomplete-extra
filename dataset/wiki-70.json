In 192, he turned against Dong Zhuo and killed him after being instigated by [[Wang Yun]] and [[Shisun Rui]] (fictionalized using [[Diao Chan]]), but was later defeated and driven away by Dong Zhuo's followers.\r\n\r\nFrom 192 to early 195, Lü Bu wandered around central and northern China, consecutively seeking shelter under warlords such as [[Yuan Shu]], [[Yuan Shao]], and [[Zhang Yang]]. In 194, he managed to take control of Yan Province from the warlord [[Cao Cao]], but Cao took back his territories within two years. In 195, Lü Bu turned against [[Liu Bei]], who had offered him refuge in Xu Province, and seized control of the province from his host. Although he had agreed to an alliance with Yuan Shu earlier, he severed ties with him after Yuan declared himself emperor and joined Cao and others in attacking the pretender. However, in 198, he sided with Yuan Shu again and came under attack by the combined forces of Cao and Liu, resulting in his defeat at the Battle of Xiapi in 199. He was captured and executed by strangulation on Cao's order.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lü Bu is described in historical and fictional sources as a nearly unchallenged and peerless warrior, he was also notorious for his unstable behaviour and brutish/ruthless behavior. He switched allegiances erratically and freely betrayed his allies. He was always suspicious of others and could not control his subordinates. All these factors  eventually became the reason of his downfall.\r\n\r\nh4.

He gathered a militia army to fight the [[Yellow Turbans]] with [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], later participating in the coalition against [[Dong Zhuo]]. Following this, he joined his childhood friend Gongsun Zan and fought under him against [[Yuan Shao]], who then sent him to help [[Tao Qian]] against [[Cao Cao]]. Thanks to the support of the influential Mi and Chen families along with Tao Qian's last will, Liu Bei inherited the Xu Province. After his defeat against Cao Cao, [[Lu Bu|Lü Bu]] joined him, but betrayed him with Yuan Shu and seized Xu Province. Later Liu Bei joined Cao Cao and they defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Although he was treated well by Cao Cao, Liu Bei received a secret edict from the emperor to kill Cao Cao and rebelled. After a brief alliance with Yuan Shao, Liu Bei was quickly defeated by Cao Cao and had to fflee.

Together they opposed Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\r\n\r\nAfter Cao Cao's defeat, Liu Bei quickly took control of the majority of Jing Province and married Sun Quan's sister. Sun Quan then agreed to \"lend\" him Nan Commandery. Liu Bei later led his army to join another kinsman, [[Liu Zhang]], in his war against the warlord [[Zhang Lu]].

However soon after [[Guan Yu]] was killed by Liu Bei's \"ally\" Sun Quan who took the rest of Jing province. Liu Bei was furious and led his army against his former ally but was defeated by [[Lu Xun]]. Ashamed by his failure, he never returned to Chengdu and settled in Baidicheng where he died one year later. He urged his heir, [[Liu Shan]] not to emulate him and rather be as virtuous as possible.

Consequently, she attained 12 battle honours.\r\n\r\nPost-war, consideration was given to turn her to a museum ship as she largely remained unchanged from her war years but she had deteriorated in reserve so [[Belfast (Azur Lane)|]] was selected instead.

In particular, [i]Seydlitz[/i] featured better armor and propulsion over her preceding battlecruisers.\r\n\r\nShe was commissioned in 1913, with her first crew that of [[Yorck (Azur Lane)|]]'s, having just been transferred to reserve.\r\n\r\nShe participated in many fleet actions throughout World War I, especially the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland, where she survived severe damage that would have otherwise sunk her (which explains one of her skills that grants her temporary immunity from being sunk in a sortie). Later, she would have been part of the [[Operation Ten-Gou|Ten Go]]-style \"suicidal sortie\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_order_of_24_October_1918] of the German Navy's High Seas Fleet in late October 1918, but mutinies broke out that forced the cancellation of the sortie.

An [[Shadowverse_(anime)|anime adaptation]] by Zexcs aired from April 2020 to March 2021. A second anime series titled [[shadowverse_flame|Shadowverse Flame]] is currently being aired following the events of the first one after a three-year time skip.\r\n\r\nh4. Gameplay\r\n\r\nTo begin, one must choose one of eight classes to play with (whichever one you choose can be changed later) each with a different playstyle and mechanics. Each class has access to a personal selection of cards in addition to a general pool (which is counted as a ninth class not playable on its own). \r\n\r\nEach player can mulligan their starting hand to find better cards in case of a bad draw. The player who goes first gets 2 evolution points, and the player who goes second gets 3 evolution points. \r\n\r\nAt the start of their turn, each player draws one card from their deck and places it in their hand. The player who goes second draws two cards on the first turn. Cards in the deck can't be seen during battle.\r\n\r\nh4.

The captain of Akebono was unjustly scapegoated by the admiral for letting Shoukaku become damaged during the Battle of Coral Sea, even though there was little a destroyer could do about multiple waves of aircraft. She was reassigned to the rear after that, and never again had a prestigious post. Furthermore, on her next escort mission [i][[Albacore (Azur Lane)|USS Albacore]][/i] sank her sister-ship Sazanami.

Mogami was then sunk by air attacks which Akebono was powerless to stop. Akebono was afterward tasked with protecting Nachi from further air attacks in Manila, which resulted in Nachi being destroyed by aircraft and Akebono being severely damaged. Akebono was towed to dock by Ushio, but further air raids destroyed Akebono in Manila Bay alongside [[Akishimo (Kancolle)|]].

Description\r\nh5. Base Art\r\n\r\nRanger has long reddish-[[pink hair]] and [[blue eyes]]. She wears a white [[tank top]] with reddish-[[pink skirt|pink]] [[pleated skirt|pleated]] [[miniskirt]] with a horizontal white stripe around it with \"RNGR\" on her left, a reference to her real-life pre-war identification marks. She has a [[black jacket]] with [[long sleeves|long]] [[detached sleeves]], and [[black thighhighs]]. In addition, she wears\r\n[[pink_gloves|pink]], [[partially fingerless gloves]], [[elbow gloves]] where the index finger is full covered, the middle finger is covered up to the first digit from the knuckle, and the ring and pinkie fingers are uncovered. She also has a [[headset]] with a [[microphone]] on her left side, a [[blue_bag|blue]] [[messenger bag]], and a [[choker]] with an [[anchor]] hanging from the front. She has very [[large breasts]] that sometimes get made bigger in what fanart she gets.\r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] is her ship model turned into a large [[crossbow]]-styled launcher. It is about 3/4 of her height, with a trigger about mid-ship on port-side. Her island superstructure is featured, alongside anti-air batteries, and a [[radar dish]]. She has a [[badge]] on her bag, which is her real life crew's badge.\r\n\r\nh5. Retrofit Art\r\n[tn]See post #2930385[/tn]\r\n\r\nIn her [[retrofit (azur lane)|]], her outfit gets swapped for white [[front-tie top]], a pair of [[uneven legwear|asymmetrical]] [[tight pants]] where the left leg is wrapped with black leather strips, and a jacket-esque [[cape]]. She sports a new [[flat cap]] with a white top and red beak, and some [[armored boots]].  Her already [[large breasts]] get more emphasize if not an actual increase.\r\n\r\nHer rigging loses the crossbow aesthetic and moves the trigger and handle aft.\r\n\r\nh5. Personality and In-game Trivia\r\nRanger takes on a role of a teacher, similar to [[Langley (Azur Lane)|]], treating the Commander as one of her students. She gets easily flustered, stuttering and getting embarrassed in several of her lines, with a number of things suggesting some desire for her students.\r\n\r\nHer plane loadout is purely dive bombers (like her real-life counterpart). Her skillset is particularly RNG dependent, leading to potentially hilarious damage output.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nIn real life, [i]Ranger[/i] was the US Navy's first carrier designed and built from scratch, providing valuable training experience to Naval aviators for the likelihood of war. In World War II, she primarily saw combat in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters as her comparatively slow speed, minimal armor, and limited plane capacity prevented her from seeing service in the Pacific other than training duties from 1944 onward. She was decommissioned in 1946 and sold for scrap a year later.\r\n\r\nh4. Skins\r\n* !post #2930382: Default\r\n* !post #2930385: [[ranger_(retrofit)_(azur_lane)|Retrofit]]\r\n\r\nh4.
