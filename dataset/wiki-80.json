Aside from lowered superstructures and a revised weapons suite, she and her sister ship [[Yuugure (Azur Lane)|]] were the first destroyers fitted with the 12.7 cm twin Type C mounts as used by the succeeding [[Shiratsuyu (Azur Lane)|]], [[Asashio (Azur Lane)|]], and [[Kagerou (Azur Lane)|]] classes. In addition, they both received two rudders, one aft of each propeller, in an attempt to reduce severe heeling at turns, only to have them removed after their trials in 1935 as the same design changes made the use of twin rudders redundant.\r\n\r\nAssigned to DesDiv 27, they escorted the Second Carrier Division ([[Hiryuu (Azur Lane)|]] and [[Souryuu (Azur Lane)|]]) in raids on Rabaul and Darwin. They repeated the same task for the Fifth CarDiv ([[Shoukaku (Azur Lane)|]] and [[Zuikaku (Azur Lane)|]]) in the battle of the Coral Sea.\r\n\r\nShe was sunk on July 28, 1943 by engaging B-25 Mitchell bombers while assisting [[Mikazuki (Azur Lane)|]]. This was after completing a troop transport at Tuluvu, New Britain (now part of Papua New Guinea), during which the two destroyers ran aground on a reef off Cape Gloucester.\r\n\r\nFor her retrofit form, see her [[ariake (retrofit) (azur lane)|corresponding page.]]\r\n\r\nh4.
