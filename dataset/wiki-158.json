During the 1950s Tomsin, the last white beer brewery in Hoegaarden, closed. The local milkman, Pierre Celis, had worked at the Tomsin brewery as a young man. In 1965, while in his forties, Celis decided to purchase some brewing equipment and start making white beer again. He recreated the recipe based on his experience working at the brewery and from locals who remembered the look and taste of the beer. His new brewery was called De Kluis, meaning “cloister,” in honor of the monks who brewed beer in the region during the Middle Ages. The beer was called Hoegaarden, after Celis’ hometown.\r\n\r\nSold in dozens of countries worldwide, Hoegaarden is widely considered the standard of the Belgian-white style of beer. It is made from malted barley, unmalted wheat, hops, coriander, and curaçao orange peel. It is very pale in color and hazy with a frothy head of foam. The aroma and taste are citrusy, fruity, spicy, and refreshing, with a light snappy bitterness. The beer is light-bodied, well balanced, and mild in strength and balanced with a deceptively mild amount of alcohol (4.9% ABV).\r\n\r\nHoegaarden quickly became successful in Belgium and elsewhere around the world. By 1985 the brewery was producing 75,000 hectoliters of beer per year, when disaster struck and the brewery burned to the ground. Unable to rebuild on his own, Celis turned to the Belgian brewing group Interbrew (now AB-InBev), who eventually ended up owning the brewery and brand.\r\n\r\nTypes of Hoegaarden beer.\r\n\r\nRosée.\r\nLaunched in 2007, 3% ABV.

He occasionally sports a [[turquoise scarf]] and is seen with circular, [[white bands]] looped around his calves. He also wears a distinct pair of [[hanafuda earrings]], with the image of the rising sun over a mountain.\r\n\r\nDuring the Final Selection, Tanjiro wears a blue, cloud-patterned samue-styled [[kimono]] and [[black pants]], nearly identical to Sakonji's outfit. He still wears his [[hanafuda earrings]], but his hair is cut extremely short and remains the same length since. Similar to the rest of the apprentices that were trained under Sakonji, Tanjiro wears a hand-carved [[fox mask]] crafted from his master on the left side of his head. The mask has red accents on the eyes, ears, and spots on each corner of its mouth. On the upper right corner of the mask, there is a sun-shaped design that likely symbolizes the scar on his forehead.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro wears the standard [[Demon Slayer uniform]], a dark-brown gakuran jacket, a white belt, baggy chocho zubon pants that extend into tabi socks, a pair of zōri with red straps, and bands of white cloth wrapped tightly around his calves resembling kyahan, all beneath his signature [[checkered haori]]. He carries a large [[wooden box]] on his back (which was a gift to him from [[Urokodaki Sakonji]]), where his sister sleeps as they travel during the day.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]After being turned into a [[demon]] by [[Kibutsuji Muzan]], Tanjiro is able to heal the growth on his face as well as regenerate his lost arm and other smaller injuries. He obtains eyes with [[slit pupils]], fangs and flame-shaped marks over his left forehead and right jaw that are reminiscent of those of [[Kokushibou]], in addition to a third, smaller flame-shaped mark coming down from the right side of his head down to his eyebrow after he conquered the weakness to sunlight. His scar turns into a flame-pattern as if it were a permanent Demon Slayer Mark, has become longer and is the largest of the three, and all three marks vaguely point towards his nose, though only his scar-mark reaches it. He still dons his bloodstained corps uniform, one sleeve ripped off where his arm was severed, but loses his checkered haori and the Nichirin Sword at his hip.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[spoiler]After returning to his human form, Tanjiro loses the ability to see from his right eye, the iris of which is now a dull pink-gray color and the pupil black rather than its original white. His left arm, which he regrew as a [[Demon]], now takes the appearance of that which an older person may have, becoming wrinkled and skeletal, and he loses all feeling in it below the elbow and thus the ability to move it from his forearm down.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nh4.

These are the most popular versions of the series, especially outside of Japan (where the manga remained the most popular iteration of the series). Other media include the 2000 movie, a series of short comedy episodes, a second OVA (consisting of three episodes), and a special called \"Fighting Wings\" that adapts the story arc of the same name from the manga. \r\n\r\nh4.

Initially her love of candy was played up as her primary quirk; it faded into a minor trait as her character developed. She became best friends with [[Aikawa Chinatsu]] after befriending her at the game's first New Year's event. In fact, one of her stages of evolution leading up to a swimsuit S Rare features her wearing Chinatsu's glasses.\r\n\r\nShe has been known to tease the Producer about indirect kisses when she offered him a lick of her lollipop, which is her favorite food. She refers to the Producer with the “-chan” honorific.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yui is a fun loving and excitable teen. She loves the freedom some roles give her, particularly that of a pirate. She tries to be mature by bringing her version of a hot drink to an onsen, but finds the cola to be disgusting due to it having gone flat. She is friends with Chinatsu and [[Mary Cochran]]. She wanted to walk with the Producer under an umbrella together and tried to get a taste of [[Mochizuki Hijiri]]’s cake until Hijiri began to cry in worry for a sugar figurine’s life. Yui is quick to point out that [[Ohta Yuu]]’s chocolate figure is suspicious and hopes Akky isn’t in any danger.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 9th set of CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Igarashi Kyoko]], [[Ninomiya Asuka]], [[Nakano Yuka]], and [[Aiba Yumi]].

Has brown eyes and long black hair in twintails.\r\n\r\nYuka is a karate champion who seeks to expand her horizons by becoming an idol. She was her karate teams’ team captain and was the ranking National Champion. Karate is a major aspect of her life, but she wants to be a master of dance and song as well.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, unlike other idols' hobbies, Yuka’s is never visually incorporated into her idol costumes. She's shown to wear a karate gi in her first card illustration (taken before she became an idol), but it's never been shown on stage. Instead, her trademark is her two ponytails, and she gets very embarrassed if she's seen with her hair down.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yuka is depicted as being abnormally strong. In her first appearance, she breaks a dartboard in half with a single throw. She has some experience with cooking, although she does have trouble keeping up with a pumped up [[Mukai Takumi]]. She participated in a talk battle with [[Hamaguchi Ayame]], [[Ohnuma Kurumi]], and [[Hayami Kanade]]. When she landed a role with [[Yamato Aki]] and [[Manabe Itsuki]] in a Kung Fu movie, she eagerly performed moves that had a focus on animal names. She seems to like [[Mizumoto Yukari]]’s sleeping face.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 9th set of CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Ninomiya Asuka]], [[Ohtsuki Yui]], [[Igarashi Kyoko]], and [[Aiba Yumi]].

The wrestler then does a spinning toe hold and grasps the other leg, crossing them into a \"4\" (hence the name) as he does so and falls to the mat, applying pressure to the opponent's crossed legs with his own. \r\n\r\nWhile the hold applies pressure to the knee, it actually can be very painful to the shin of the victim. While the move is primarily a submission move, if the opponent has his shoulders on the mat, the referee can make a three count for a pinfall. If the referee is distracted, heel wrestlers may grab onto the ropes while executing the move to gain leverage and inflict more pain. \r\n\r\nWith enough strength and willpower, the wrestler on defense can flip himself (and also their opponent) over onto their belly, which is said to reverse the pressure to the one who initially had the hold locked in.\r\n\r\nThis is innovated by \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers and popularized by Ric Flair.

The Allied reporting name for the type was [b]Mavis[/b]; the Navy designation was \"[b]Type 97 Large Flying Boat[/b]\" (九七式大型飛行艇).\r\n\r\nThe aircraft was designed in response to a Navy requirement of 1934 for a long-range flying boat and incorporated knowledge gleaned by a Kawanishi team that visited the Short Brothers factory in the UK.\r\n\r\nH6Ks were deployed from 1938 onwards, first seeing service in the Sino-Japanese War and were in widespread use by the time the full-scale Pacific War erupted, in December 1941. At that time of the war, four [i]Kōkūtai[/i] (air groups) operated a total of 66 H6K4s.\r\n\r\nThe type had some success over South East Asia and the South West Pacific. H6Ks had excellent endurance, being able to undertake 24-hour patrols, and were often used for long-range reconnaissance and bombing missions. From bases in the Dutch East Indies, they were able to undertake missions over a large portion of Australia.\r\n\r\nHowever, the H6K became vulnerable to a newer generation of more heavily armed and faster fighters. It continued in service throughout the war, in areas where the risk of interception was low. In front-line service, it was replaced by the Kawanishi H8K.\r\n\r\nh4.

The setting is moved to the year 5053 (vs. 1815-1838 in the novel), though the majority of the story remains in France. The protagonist is [[Albert de Morcerf]] instead of Edmond Dantes. \r\n\r\nThe series is notable for its use of a \"collage\" effect where the hair and clothing of characters act as \"holes\" to stationary backgrounds underneath (the pattern stays still, but the opening changes as the characters move around) (see post #139047 for a good example of the effect on Haydee). The series also makes heavy use of CG art.\r\n\r\nA manga by Maeda Mahiro, director of the TV series, was also released, beginning in 2005 in Kodansha's [i]Afternoon[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.

It needs some space behind the opponent to be effective, and can be applied from the side control or guard. Contrary to the americana, the opponent's wrist is grabbed with the hand on the same side, and the opposite arm is put behind the opponent's arm, again grabbing the attacker's wrist and forming a figure-four. By controlling the opponent's body and cranking the arm away from the attacker, pressure is put on the shoulder joint, and depending on the angle, also the elbow joint (in some variations the opponent's arm is brought behind their back, resulting in a finishing position resembling that of the hammerlock).\r\n\r\nThe kimura was named after the judoka Kimura Masahiko, who used it to defeat one of the founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hélio Gracie.
