Kinzie Kensington knows their real name, but is stopped mid-sentence before saying it, as The Protagonist warns her that somebody else might be listening in on their radio conversation. On television they're given various titles, including \"Leader of the Saints\" and \"Local Psychopath\". In Saints Row IV, they are referred to as \"The President of the United States\" or simply \"The President\".\r\n\r\nIf the \"Nolan North\" voice is selected in Saints Row IV during the mission A Pleasant Day, Kinzie asks The Protagonist to be themselves while causing destruction, and he replies \"be...

Similar to Maho, she is outgoing, energetic and happy-go-lucky, but sometimes displays a rather bizarre way of thinking. But unlike Maho, Hinata is very well-behaved. Hinata also often comes across as air-headed. On the other hand, as her nickname \"Innocent Charm\" suggests, she can be manipulative by using her cuteness to get others to do things for her.\r\n\r\nHinata views Subaru as a big-brother-like figure, and doesn't mind making physical contacts with him. As seen in several moments she loves hugging him and being carried on his back, her \"Koala Attack\" of fan-service, and even wants to sleep with him in same bed. However like all girls in the team, Hinata also has deeper feelings for Subaru, and becomes slightly anxious if Subaru gets too close to other girls. Especially in Episode 4 and Episode 7 of first season, she eagerly wants to know if Subaru has feelings to her, when he \"confesses\" to Airi.\r\n\r\nBeing the elder one of the Hakamada sisters, Hinata cares about her little sibling, Kagetsu, very much.
