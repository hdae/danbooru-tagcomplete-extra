It aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, spanning a total of nine seasons. \r\n\r\nBased on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted for American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, [[King of the Hill]], and [[The Simpsons]]. It was co-produced by Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\r\n\r\nLike its British counterpart, the series was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track to simulate the look of an actual documentary. The series debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and aired 201 episodes for its run. The Office originally featured [[Steve Carell]], Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as the main cast; however, the series experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast include Ed Helms, Amy Ryan, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson, James Spader, Ellie Kemper, and Catherine Tate.\r\n\r\nThe Office was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly Carell's performance, received significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters, content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the British version. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for a decline in quality. Many saw Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the ninth and final season ended the series with a generally positive response. The series finale, which originally aired on May 16, 2013, was viewed by an estimated 5.7 million viewers and garnered critical acclaim. In 2016, Rolling Stone named The Office one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":195185,"created_at":"2024-06-04T04:27:08.312-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-15T16:26:37.266-04:00","title":"trail","body":"Ambiguous tag.

The 82-day battle lasted from 1 April until 22 June 1945. After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, 340 mi (550 km) away.\r\n\r\nThe battle has been referred to as the \"typhoon of steel\" in English, of which the Japanese original phrase was \"tetsu no bōfū\". The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of Japanese kamikaze attacks and the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle was the bloodiest in the Pacific, with around 50,000 Allied and 84,166–117,000 Japanese casualties,  including Okinawans conscripted into the Japanese Army. According to local authorities, at least 149,425 Okinawan people were killed, died by coerced suicide or went missing.\r\n\r\nIn [[operation_ten-gou|the naval operations surrounding the battle]], both sides lost considerable numbers of [[ship]]s and [[aircraft]], including the [[yamato_(battleship)|Japanese battleship Yamato]]. \r\n\r\nAfter the American [[victory]] in the battle, which was very costly (50,000 U.S. soldier casualties, includeed 12,500 killed and missing as well as 36,122 wounded), Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan for US forces in preparation for \"the invasion of the Japanese home islands\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall.\r\n\r\nThe high number of U.S. casualties in this battle was one of the reasons for their [[Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] to end [[the Pacific]] war.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["沖縄戦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":19441,"created_at":"2010-06-03T21:37:20.523-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T21:52:23.673-04:00","title":"yuuichi_(tareme_paradise)","body":"Artist who was active on \"NIFTY SERVE\":http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%95%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96 (a now-defunct Japanese commercial online service provider).

On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine [[military]] personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed during the hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was a major [[Cold War]] episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus described its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty and culture. Neither state officially declared war, although both governments declared the islands a war zone.\r\n\r\nThe conflict had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratisation of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it has remained a common topic for discussion. \r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two governments issued a joint statement. No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina adopted a new constitution, which declared the Falkland Islands as part of one of its provinces by law. However, the islands continue to operate as a self-governing British Overseas Territory.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フォークランド紛争","フォークランドふんそう"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208320,"created_at":"2024-09-14T21:24:17.477-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T21:24:17.477-04:00","title":"neon_katt","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["NeonKatt"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":117903,"created_at":"2020-10-28T18:47:00.145-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T21:22:18.498-04:00","title":"funamusea","body":"An umbrella tag for artwork related to [[Funamusea (artist)|]]'s works, which all take place in the same universe, as well as original characters that have yet to appear in anything.\r\n\r\nh4.

Two more videos were made, following up this otoMAD, using the openings from [[Shinzou Ningen Casshern]] and the 1969 [[Tiger Mask (series)|]] anime respectively. The thumbnails for each of these is Jaguar having her right arm raised.\r\n\r\nThe videos soon popped off on [[Niconico]], spawning derivative meme/[[neta]] videos, successors and so forth, developing into its own minor meme series. The Jaguarman Series explicitly refers to those which have Jaguar as the focal figure (or, more narrowly, the original three otoMADs), while branches such as Wakaruman (fusing [[Wakari Tetsuya]] with the Devilman part of the meme) don't have to necessarily have her in such a position. \r\n\r\nh4.

Aside from post #3731497 (shared February 2016 during [[Girls' Frontline]]'s third beta), [[lowlight kirilenko|Hai Mao]] had drawn her with [[M4 SOPMOD II (girls' frontline)|]] on \"a signboard\":[https://zh.moegirl.org/File:%E6%B5%B7%E7%8C%AB%E7%BB%9C%E5%90%88%E7%89%A9%E7%9A%84W%E7%AD%BE%E7%BB%98.jpg] for a fan of the latter, around 2016 whilst they were selling a new doujin book (to the curiosity of the fan who'd later share the art on Weibo). With the design resemblance, and already designating her with the name W, players have thus decided to refer to this version of her as such too.\r\n\r\nDesign-wise, just as with Arknights' W, she appears to have white/silver hair along with dark red accents, though more akin to SOPMOD and less like antennae. Though both having bandanas or scarfs, in place of red horns, she wears a headset. Uniquely to her, she appears to have a mole under her left eye, and appears to have a walkie-talkie on her left shoulder. On the signboard, she also has hands like those SOPMOD has. \r\n\r\nThough the association with SOPMOD has brought some speculation as to what her weapon may have been, it is most commonly thought to be the one that Arknights' W is seen with, a Mk18 Mod0 (derived from the SOPMOD accessory system for the [[M4 Carbine]]); otherwise known as the CQBR or CQBW (CQB Weapon), with some proponents of this theory speculating the \"W\" in her name to derive from the latter, bolstered by the fact that Arknights' W has \"CQBW\" as her in-game codename. In 2024, Girls' Frontline finally added [[mk.18 (girls' frontline)|a character]] representing the Mk18 Mod0.\r\n\r\nFollowing Hai Mao's departure from MICA Team in 2017, and the formation of HyperGryph, it is probable that Hai Mao recycled the design for Arknights, alongside other elements they contributed that didn't make the cut for Girls' Frontline (such as the proto-Doctor design found with proto-W, or their proposed draft for the early chapters prior to Jano [热运动] rewriting it, involving an amnesiac Commander awaking in the middle of combat against an abstractly and fantastically strong Sangvis Ferri).","is_locked":false,"other_names":["W(少女前線)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208234,"created_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:44.410-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:44.410-04:00","title":"multicolored_crown","body":"A [[crown]] that is multiple colors.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208233,"created_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:08.146-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:08.146-04:00","title":"orange_crown","body":"A [[crown]] that is colored orange.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208232,"created_at":"2024-09-14T18:32:58.197-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T18:32:58.197-04:00","title":"xm556_(girls'_frontline)","body":"An android representing the [[XM556]] in [[Girls' Frontline]].\r\n\r\nh4.
