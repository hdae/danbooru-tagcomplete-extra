The movie received positive reviews by fans and critics due to its story, characters and usage of G1-inspired designs for the robots.\r\n\r\nA sequel, titled [b][[Transformers: Rise of the Beasts]][/b], was announced for a June 2023 release, introducing elements of [[Beast Wars]]  into the films.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":77479,"created_at":"2016-07-10T20:32:31.748-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-21T16:33:50.961-04:00","title":"gachimuchi","body":"[b]Gachimuchi[/b] (or [b]Wrestling Series[/b]) is a [[meme]]tic universe which revolves around male porn actors (mostly from Can-Am Productions) flexing their muscles, wearing and doing [[BDSM]] stuff, and doing [i]gay pants wrestling[/i] (from where the tag gets its name, \"Gachimuchi\" meaning [i]buff man in underwear[/i] in Japan) in homoerotic films taken out of context.\r\n\r\nThe meme originated when [[Niconico]] members uploaded a video of [[Billy Herrington]] and [[Danny Lee]] doing [i]pants wrestling[/i] under the title \"[b]本格的 ガチムチパンツレスリング[/b]\" ([i]Professional Pant Wrestler Fighting Seriously[/i]) in 2007. This later spawned tons of parodies around [i]pants wrestling[/i] and related people that acted in non-pants wrestling porn with a pants wrestler as an actor in the aforementioned porno.\r\n\r\nIt is often paired with [[Manatsu no yo no Inmu]] (Inmu-chu) and [[Kuso Miso Technique]] ([[Yaranaika]]) as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ), since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nWhile Gachi parodies did find their way outside of Japan, most prominently between 2007 and 2012, it wasn't until later from 2015 onwards that it spread even further under the name [b]gachiGASM[/b] (named after the BTTV emotes for [[Twitch.tv]] featuring Billy Herrington's iconic face) and spawned countless more sub-memes.\r\n\r\nWhile Gachimuchi's popularity has decreased with the Japanese (being supplanted by Inmu on Niconico), Gachimuchi is currently extremely popular internationally. On the Chinese video site [[Bilibili]], the Chinese started making parodies of their popular TV series and movies, and also parodies of Japanese anime. Many Gachimuchi videos became some of the most viewed videos on Bilibili (one having had over 5 million views). This popularity would, however, lead to Bilibili attempting to squash the community on the site, leading to it dispersing across other Chinese communities. It also became popular in Russia, where a live-action parody and various music remix was made of it in spite of the country's anti-homosexual laws.\r\n\r\nThe tag used for Gachimuchi on Bilibili and in Chinese communities is [b]哲♂学 (Learning♂Philosophy)[/b].\r\n\r\nh4.

Danbooru utilizes a unique soft-translation system that enables translations to appear on images which are written in their native, non-English languages.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Things to keep in mind before you start translating\r\n\r\n* Be reasonably sure you understand the source material completely before attempting a translation. It is best to read through the material once before you begin to judge its difficulty; if it seems too high in places, it's best to leave it for another.\r\n* Please leave honorifics in place. This is to keep a consistent style of honorific usage across the board, and Japanese honorifics usually don't translate well to English titles.\r\n* Try not to introduce elements which were not present in the original. Given that Japanese leans on implication and context, sometimes it is unavoidable to make matters explicit in English.\r\n* Don't use Japanese words if an equivalent English term exists.\r\n** But don't go overboard with the above. Some Japanese concepts are untranslatable. If you have to choose between accuracy, understanding, and English, it's better to sacrifice English than understanding or accuracy.\r\n* Make sure your English is idiomatic and well-written. Wooden translations mimicking the Japanese word-for-word are not proper translations. Try to select idioms with the same meanings as Japanese counterparts.\r\n** Limit translation notes to the most intractable jokes, puns, and cultural concepts. It is better for the reader to miss a shade of meaning than be forced to halt and read a note.\r\n** Puns and jokes are a special category on their own. Here it's allowable to be much more flexible, as long as the general meaning remains. It's heaps better to make a joke that clicks in English and then explain nuances in a translation note, than to make something completely unfunny and then explain in a note why it was a joke.\r\n* Endeavor to completely translate the material on an image. That said, if you encounter something you don't understand, it is better to leave it partially translated and put out a call for help.\r\n** When making partial translations, or when continuing on after leaving something untranslated, be reasonably sure the missing context isn't overly detrimental to your understanding.\r\n* Use the names romanized in the same way as our tags have them. Generally this means Surname Forename, and make sure you stick to [[howto:romanize|our romanization rules]] too.\r\n* [b]Ask for help.[/b] Everyone makes mistakes, including native speakers at times. The Japanese language is full of nuances that are sometimes hard to capture in plain text. That being said, try not to translate something out of your understanding -- it is better to have a decent translation improved, than to have a nonsensical translation figured out.\r\n\r\n[expand=Translation tasks by difficulty/complexity:]\r\n\r\n1. Single words and common phrases\r\n2. Phrases and simple sentence\r\n3. Complex sentences and simple single page comics\r\n4. Simple multipage comics\r\n5. Complex single page comics and paragraphs of text ([[text_focus]] or commentary translation)\r\n6. Complex multipage comics\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, start small and work your way up. If something feels too difficult or comes out clunky, move to easier tasks until you get the hang of translating\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4. Step by step breakdown of how to translate\r\n\r\n* Go to an image in need of translation (look at [[translation_request]]s). You can also try searching the comments for people who \"bumped images for translation\":[/comments?commit=Search&group_by=comment&search%5Bbody_matches%5D=translation&search%5Border%5D=id_desc&utf8=%E2%9C%93].\r\n* Click on Add Translation in the sidebar to the left or press 'n' on the keyboard. Click and drag on the image around where the text is. One note will be created. (Use multiple notes for multiple parts!)\r\n* To change the size of a note after creating it, move (by dragging) and resize (by dragging the bottom right corner) the note. [b]Remember to save afterwards.[/b] Your changes won't do anything until you save, so it's better to move, then add text than the other way around.\r\n* [b]Try to make the notes as small as possible.[/b] They should obscure the minimal area of the picture. If there are natural borders (such as a rectangular speech box) you can use to hide the note, do it. Make the note match the box pixel-for-pixel as best as you can. Alternatively, stick it as close to the text as possible. (The first frame of post #4487 is a good example of fitting a translation box to text, and post #577456 of fitting it to a box in the image.)\r\n* Hover the mouse cursor inside the note to make an empty square appear below it. Click it to edit.\r\n* Write your translation in the box. Limited HTML markup is allowed; a list of useful tags is available at [[about:note_formatting]]. The site provides several custom named fonts for translation use that are not dependent on browser or OS: see [[about:note_fonts]] for a list. Use <tn>translation note here</tn> to add a translation note. Don't add a linebreak before a translation note, as that's done automatically.\r\n* Repeat until all the text has been translated.\r\n* [b]Make sure you change the [[translation_request]] tag to [[translated]]![/b] \r\n\r\nh4. Tags relating to translation\r\n\r\n* [[translation_request]] - images with significant Japanese (or other language, combine with for example [[chinese_text]]) text to translate; that's left completely or partially untranslated.\r\n* [[partially_translated]] - images that have been partially translated. As mentioned above, this isn't generally encouraged, but in some cases it can be fine, such as when the image is very long, or when the text is not strongly related (for example post #570410).\r\n* [[check_translation]] - used for images that have been translated but that either the translator or other people are unsure about whether it's right. Or, perhaps the English is so confusing that the translation needs double-checking to convert it to something that makes sense.\r\n* [[translated]] - images that have been [i]completely[/i] translated. Nothing less than completely (and properly) translated, please. When placing this tag, Remove the [[translation_request]] tag and the [[partially_translated]] if it's there. An image should never be tagged with [[translated]] and [[translation_request]].\r\n* [[hard-translated]] - images that have already gone through [[third-party_edit]] to replace the original text (Japanese or otherwise) with a translation into another different language. It is discouraged on Danbooru.\r\n\r\nh4. Translation aids for Danbooru\r\n\r\n* \"Note assist\":[/forum_topics/9373] is a userscript that adds new features to the note system. They include automatically resizing your notes to fit the text as well as buttons for quick access to more advanced note formatting such as text size and color. It is still a work-in-progress and aimed at advanced users.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[List of SFX]]\r\n\r\nh4.

Each post can have many [[help:tags|tags]], [[help:comments|comments]], [[help:notes|notes]], and a single [[help:artist commentary|artist commentary]]. Each post may also belong to multiple [[help:pools|pools]]. If you have an [[help:users|account]], you can also add a post to your [[help:favorites|favorites]] or [[help:favorite groups|favorite groups]].\r\n\r\nh4. Searching\r\n\r\nSearching for posts is straightforward. Simply enter the tags you want to search for, separating tags by spaces and words [i]within[/i] tags by underscores. For example, searching for {{blonde_hair blue_eyes}} will return every post that has both the [[blonde hair]] tag [b]and[/b] the [[blue eyes]] tag.\r\n\r\nBe aware that tags for characters and series are usually known by their original Japanese names, not their English names. For example, the tag on Danbooru for [i]The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya[/i] is [[Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]]. See [[help:tags]] for more information.\r\n\r\nDanbooru also offers many metatags that let you further refine your search. Metatags allow you to query on things like image width, height, score, uploader, upload date, and more. Consult the [[help:cheatsheet|cheat sheet]] for a complete list of what you can do.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that Members are limited to two tags per search. See [[help:users]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4. Tag List\r\n\r\nIn both the post listing page and on individual post pages you'll notice a list of tags with links next to them. Here's an explanation of what the links are:\r\n\r\n[b]?[/b]\r\n    This links to the wiki page for the tag. If the tag is an [[help:artists|artist]] type, then you'll be redirected to the artist page.\r\n\r\n[b]950[/b]\r\n    The number next to the tag represents how many posts there are. This isn't always the total number of posts for that tag. If you're searching for a combination of tags, this will be the number of posts that have the tag AND the current tag query. If you're not searching for anything, this will be the number of posts found within the last twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[b]Color[/b]\r\n    Some tag links may be colored green, purple, or red. Green means the tag represents a character. Purple means the tag represents a copyright (things like anime, manga, games, or novels). Red means the tag represents an [[help:artists|artist]].\r\n\r\nWhen you're not searching for a tag, by default the tag list will show the most popular tags within the last three days. When you are searching for tags, the tag list will show related tags, sorted by relevancy.\r\n\r\nh2#mode-menu. Mode Menu\r\n\r\n[[help:users|Gold and above users]] will notice a menu labeled \"Mode\" in the sidebar on the main listing page. This menu lets you make several changes without ever leaving the listing page. Simply select an option and whenever you click on a thumbnail, the action will be performed in the background.\r\n\r\n[b]View[/b]\r\n    This is the default mode. Whenever you click on a thumbnail, you'll go to that post.\r\n\r\n[b]Edit[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, an edit box will appear. Here you can easily change the post's tags from the listing page without opening the entire post.\r\n\r\n[b]Tag script[/b]\r\n    Write a tag script into the text box that appears, and it will be applied when you click on the thumbnail of a post. This allows you to quickly add or remove tags to many posts at once. See [[help:tag scripts]] for details on creating tag scripts.\r\n\r\n[b]Favorite[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, that post will be added to your list of [[help:favorites|favorites]].\r\n\r\n[b]Unfavorite[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, that post will be removed from your list of [[help:favorites|favorites]].\r\n\r\nh4. Borders\r\n\r\nIn the listing page, you will notice that some thumbnails have a border. The meaning of this border depends on the color.\r\n\r\n[b]Blue[/b]\r\n    The post is [[about:mod_queue|pending moderator approval]] or was [[about:mod_queue|flagged for deletion]].\r\n\r\n[b]Black/Grey[/b]\r\n    The post is [[about:mod_queue|deleted]].\r\n\r\n[b]Green[/b]\r\n    The post has [[help:post relationships|child posts]].\r\n\r\n[b]Yellow[/b]\r\n    The post has a [[help:post relationships|parent]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":242973,"created_at":"2025-05-20T18:49:52.269-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-20T18:49:52.269-04:00","title":"the_phantom_(series)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ザ・ファントム"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":144016,"created_at":"2022-05-20T14:25:24.836-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-20T18:47:55.795-04:00","title":"silvia_piquet","body":"A playable character from [[Black Survival]] & [[Eternal Return: Black Survival]].

Initially named Air Combat as it’s Namco System 21 arcade original.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first Ace Combat console game, the setting of the games take place in a world similar to Earth but with a radically different history, countries, geography, and having mixed existence of both real and fictional aircraft, as well as exponentially advanced technology, superweapons, submarines, and airships that are larger than life. This world is known as \"Strangereal\". Two major events have shaped many of the events of the mainline Ace Combat games: The [[ace_combat_zero|Belkan War]], and the [[ace_combat_04|Ulysses Impact]].\r\n\r\nThe typical Ace Combat plot follows a nameless/faceless fighter pilot's rise from a fledgling rookie to become a feared and respected ace in the war he is fighting, but told in narrative perspective of the people surrounding the pilot. The pilot in question will also typically face off against \"rival\" aces from the opposing nation. The music in the series has been composed by quite a few talented people within Bandai Namco sound team, with Tetsukazu Nakanishi, Hiroshi Okubo, and Keiki Kobayashi among them. Who also worked on other projects such as [[Tekken]], [[Ridge Racer]], and [[SoulCalibur]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The Yugo would end up acquiring a reputation as the \"worst car of all time\" in the West, unhelped by foreign models having more faults than the domestic models, while it is remembered fondly in former Yugoslavia.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ザスタバ・ユーゴ","ザスタバユーゴ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":69345,"created_at":"2015-10-18T05:13:08.141-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-18T21:17:29.904-04:00","title":"barrage_balloon","body":"See [[kite balloon]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147953,"created_at":"2022-08-03T16:17:50.962-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-18T21:15:58.932-04:00","title":"percival_(dream_portrait)_(fate)","body":"[quote]\r\nCelebrating Fate/Grand Order's 7th Anniversary!\r\n\r\nTake a trip down memory lane to mark this momentous occasion.\r\n\r\nWhat would things be like now if that fateful encounter had happened differently?\r\nMaybe we'd be looking at Heroic Spirits in completely new outfits.\r\n\r\nLet's take this occasion to look back on the day we first met and imagine \"what if...\"\r\n[/quote]\r\n[[Percival (fate)|]] in his outfit from the [b]Heroic Spirit Dream Portrait[/b] collection of [[Craft Essence (fate)|]]s, commemorating [[Fate/Grand Order]]'s 7th anniversary.
