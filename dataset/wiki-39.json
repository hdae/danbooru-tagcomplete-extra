A popular theory is that the ship was originally in service under another name (possibly [i]Yorktown[/i], per a comment supposedly made in passing by Gene Roddenberry himself after Star Trek IV had premiered) and was hurriedly renamed in the aftermath of the main events of Star Trek IV.  Some non-canon reference materials published in the 1980s speculated that the ship was a new build and was constructed for use as a testbed for the Transwarp drive project; Scotty's comments in Star Trek V about how the ship had numerous problems (and essentially broke down) on it's shakedown cruise would seem to support part of this theory.  Similarly, beyond being decommissioned after the events of Star Trek VI, the ship does not have a canon fate.  The non-canon novel The Ashes of Eden shows the ship being sold for use by the defense force of the planet Chal before being destroyed defending that world.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":67410,"created_at":"2015-08-04T09:55:08.453-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-22T10:25:01.503-05:00","title":"uss_enterprise_ncc-1701","body":"A fictional spacecraft from the American sci-fi series Star Trek.

It was developed by the Ford Motor Company under a 1951 contract to replace the U.S. Army's fleet of Willys M38 jeeps, which in turn were the successors to the original Bantam-based Willys MB and Ford GP jeeps of World War II. The M151 strongly resembles its predecessors, but is larger and based on a completely new platform. Visually, it is easily distinguished by its horizontally slotted front grille (since the classic vertical grille of the earlier jeeps was, by 1951, a trademarked aspect of the civilian Jeeps being sold by Willys). The M151 was replaced starting in 1983 by the [[humvee|HMMWV]], but a few examples are allegedly still used by some Special Forces units today.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":75373,"created_at":"2016-05-09T14:49:09.792-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-21T08:56:13.134-05:00","title":"military_vehicle","body":"A vehicle that is used primarily for [[military]] (combat) purposes.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her first win was at a 2400 m race, her other wins being above that distance and her only Classics appearence being a respectable 5th place at the Kikuka Sho (3000 m.
