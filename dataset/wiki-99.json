The Princess' Heart-throbbing Rhapsody[/i]) is the sequel to the 2010 tower defense game, [i][[Mamotte Knight]][/i], developed by Ancient and was released in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place after the events of the previous game, with Princess Lola safely rescued thanks to the efforts of the four heroes and peace restored to the kingdom; however, a new threat of evil monsters known as The Four Fiends led by an evil princess has risen to plunge the kingdom into chaos. [i]Minna de Mamotte Knight[/i] expands upon its predecessor's gameplay with the inclusion of two new classes, the Old Guy and the Archer, along with the four returning classes of the previous game, adds various new character customization and RPG elements, and features the ability to create your own custom maps with its own map editor and share them via QR codes, with a story that pokes light fun at various 80's Japanese pop-culture and retro video games. It also features an optional FM synth soundtrack as downloadable content. It was localized overseas under the name [i]Gotta Protectors[/i] in 2016.\r\n\r\nIn celebration of the game's 3rd anniversary in Japan, Ancient released a freeware mini-game in 2017, [i]Minna de Mamotte Knight: Amazon no Diet Daisakusen[/i] (also known as [i]Gotta Protectors: Amazon's Running Diet[/i] in English) that can be played on  Nintendo Entertainment System emulators. It is an endless runner-styled game that is based on a reoccurring gag of the Amazon and her chubby physique as she tries to run through a forest for long as possible while collecting glass of water to stay hydrated while avoiding cupcakes along the way. It can be downloaded from the game's official Japanese website in both English and Japanese. This game would be followed up with [i]Susume!! Mamotte Knight: Hime no Totsugeki Serenade[/i] (also known as [i]Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness[/i] in English) in 2019.\r\n\r\nh4.

School Idol Festival]] cards. It's strongly associated with [[Minami Kotori]], due to the anime episode being about her and her secret maid cafe waitress career.\r\n\r\nh4.

Nabi's favorite color is blue but she dislikes bugs, greasy food and loud noises.\r\n\r\nWhile appeared reserved at first, Nabi would eventually revealed her \"wild\" sides a month after her debut by hosting a Korean swear word lesson stream and teaching her fans about various vulgar words in Korean. She's also a personal friend of a fellow artist-vtuber [[Ayamy (vtuber)|]] who gets along with her surprisingly well.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was the main designer for [[Watson Amelia]], [[Amatsuka Uto]], [[Shiratori Rena]], [[Himukai Kogane]], [[Tomo (maesond)|]], as well as the artist for [[Alice Mana]]'s redesign, thus she is known by her fans as \"Nabi-mama\" and \"Nabi-sensei\".
