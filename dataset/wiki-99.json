Her hair is usually tied with a ribbon into a [[side ponytail]].\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in her \"The Seven Mysteries of Sacred Slipper Academy\" S Rare+, that she can look more menacing than she usually does. Fans say that Kyoko has the possibility of crossing into yandere territory, however it is more likely that she is taking the role seriously.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kyoko is a sweet girl who has a joyful disposition. She loves to clean and enjoys remembering her journey as an idol. Kyoko admits that she likes the Producer enough to marry him, and hopes to share an umbrella with him when she’s caught in the rain. Her kindheartedness is displayed when she delivers Christmas presents with her fellow idols to [[Sajo Yukimi]] and how she takes care of the Producer on their day off at the beach. She seems to have trouble drawing cats, as they tend to look more like rabbits, and loves to cook.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 9th set of CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Ninomiya Asuka]], [[Ohtsuki Yui]], [[Nakano Yuka]], and [[Aiba Yumi]].

The legs are formed by the aircraft's engines and intakes, bent down and forward.

However, after receiving a prototype of a toy based in the VF-1 he noticed that the legs of the figure were very very loose and constantly fell down during transformation into jet mode, so it resembled a unused walker mecha design called \"Gawalk\" that he developed years before for another show.

Sans would ultimately beat Reigen out by 0.1%, to mass celebration. Several memes would spawn out of this, from [[Elizabeth II]] passing away in the meantime being attributed to the intensity of the finale, to Toby Fox himself \"writing\":https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1567739718762364929 a scene depicting the ending.

It developed in the [[medieval|Early Middle Ages]] and lasted for almost one thousand years until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars.\r\n\r\nOn 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] as Roman emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe more than three centuries after the fall of the ancient Western [[Roman Empire]] in 476. The title lapsed in 924, but was revived in 962 when [[Otto I]] was crowned emperor by Pope John XII, fashioning himself as Charlemagne's and the Carolingian Empire's successor, and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries.\r\n\r\nFrom 962 until the twelfth century, the empire was the most powerful monarchy in Europe. The functioning of government depended on the harmonious cooperation between emperor and vassals; this harmony was disturbed during the Salian period. The empire reached the apex of territorial expansion and power under the House of Hohenstaufen in the mid-thirteenth century, but overextension led to a partial collapse.\r\n\r\nWhile the office of emperor had been reestablished, the exact term for his realm as the \"Holy Roman Empire\" was not used until the 13th century. A process of Imperial Reform in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries transformed the empire, creating a set of institutions which endured until its final demise in the nineteenth century. On 6 August 1806, Emperor Francis II dissolved the empire following the creation – the month before, by [[france|French]] emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] – of the Confederation of the Rhine, a confederation of German client states loyal not to the Holy Roman emperor but to France.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["神聖ローマ帝国","HRE"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":192348,"created_at":"2024-05-04T21:48:12.807-04:00","updated_at":"2024-07-19T12:29:32.533-04:00","title":"roadblock","body":"A piece of [[barricade]] installed to prevent entry onto a specific route of a [[road]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["道路封鎖","どうろふうさ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":35698,"created_at":"2012-06-26T22:43:25.653-04:00","updated_at":"2024-07-19T12:26:11.970-04:00","title":"barricade","body":"A series of object or obstacle being placed to blocked entry.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["バリケード"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":200399,"created_at":"2024-07-19T12:23:17.502-04:00","updated_at":"2024-07-19T12:23:17.502-04:00","title":"in_cell","body":"When a character is inside a [[prison cell]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":131534,"created_at":"2021-12-05T17:03:10.801-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-19T12:06:13.950-04:00","title":"suuankou","body":"One of the yakuman (highest-scoring) hands in [[mahjong]].

The protagonist here has now developed a relationship with the grim reaper, now being officially lovers and spending time together. As the title of the game suggests, all the sexual scenes of the visual novel are [[paizuri]], and just like the first game, it includes a swimsuit version where the plot is left intact, and the only difference is the girls wearing swimsuits during the entire game.\r\n\r\nh4.

Accepting his fate, and ready for the eternal rest, he slowly wakes up in a mysterious reality, surrounded of cute girls claiming to be grim reapers. Naturally confused, but having no reasons to doubt them, the protagonist wants answers, nevertheless, the grim reapers are as confused as him about why he came to their dimension, or who is him in the first place. The only option left to get the answers he wants, is accept the help of the grim reapers and their conditions to understand who, or what he is.\r\n\r\nThe last official update of the game was released during April, 2022. Since then, no official updates for the game has been released, and the creator declared he is not satisfied with his own visual novel. And while he was willing to continue the project, he was simply not happy with the art and the direction of the game mechanics, so he was re-working on the game from zero, hoping to get better results. Currently, the game is still on hiatus, and its future is still unknown.\r\n\r\nh4.

Jin was able to defeat Ogre, winning the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 but was betrayed and almost shot dead by Heihachi.\r\n\r\nFrom [[Tekken 4]] onward, he would use traditional Karate instead of Mishima style to fall more in line with his mother's teachings and to distance himself from his Mishima heritage.
