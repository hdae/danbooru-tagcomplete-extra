Her captain, Willard A. Kitts, was also awarded the Navy Cross for his handling of the evacuation, although he survived her sinking.\r\n\r\nThe historical Northampton was launched from Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts on 5 September 1929 and was sunk by torpedos in the Battle of Tassafaronga, on 30 November 1942.\r\n\r\nh4.

The X-Drive appears to only last for one use before the user's Symphogear reverts to their normal form at whatever level they had last naturally unlocked it at.\r\n\r\nWhen the X-Drive is active, the Symphogear gains a predominantly-white color scheme and enhanced design, universally including the addition of angelic wings formed of colored light. In this state, all Symphogears, regardless of their normal abilities, are capable of unassisted flight both in the Earth's atmosphere and in space. They can also communicate telepathically with each other, and others such as Finé. All of the user's normal attacks can still be utilized, but at such a drastically greater level of both power and scope that destroying an entire army of Noise is an easy task, and even standing up to a fully-energized complete relic becomes possible. On top of this, the X-Drive can be used to bolster the strength of another wielded relic, such as Solomon's Cane or [[Durandal (symphogear)|Durandal]].\r\n\r\nThe X-Drive's particular form and strength is based off the current level of power the Symphogear has achieved before unlocking it, as [[Tachibana Hibiki (symphogear)|Hibiki]], [[Kazanari Tsubasa|Tsubasa]] and [[Yukine Chris|Chris]] all possessed radically different X-Drive forms when they unlocked them again in G compared to their forms in season 1.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エクスドライブ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":176095,"created_at":"2023-11-02T12:08:30.921-04:00","updated_at":"2023-11-02T12:08:30.921-04:00","title":"yukitsuri","body":"Ropes used to secure trees in winter.\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia - Yukitsuri\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukitsuri","is_locked":false,"other_names":["雪つり","雪吊"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":176093,"created_at":"2023-11-02T11:54:39.590-04:00","updated_at":"2023-11-02T11:54:39.590-04:00","title":"stickleback","body":"The sticklebacks are a family of ray-finned fishes, the Gasterosteidae which have a Holarctic distribution in fresh, brackish and marine waters.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":176092,"created_at":"2023-11-02T11:46:36.128-04:00","updated_at":"2023-11-02T11:46:36.128-04:00","title":"hyuganatsu","body":"Hyuganatsu is a citrus fruit and plant grown in Japan.

Dick]] first published in 1968. The main plot follows [[Rick Deckard]], a bounty hunter of renegade [[android]]s, while the secondary plot follows John Isidore, a man of sub-normal intelligence who befriends some of the androids. \r\n\r\nThe novel is set in a post-apocalyptic near future, where the Earth and its populations have been damaged greatly by Nuclear War during World War Terminus. Most types of animals are endangered or extinct due to extreme radiation poisoning from the war. To own an animal is a sign of status, but what is emphasized more is the empathic emotions humans experience towards an animal. \r\n\r\nDeckard is faced with \"retiring\" six escaped [i]Nexus-6[/i] model androids, the latest and most advanced model. Because of this task, the novel explores the issue of what it is to be human. Unlike humans, the androids possess no empathic sense. In essence, Deckard probes the existence of defining qualities that separate humans from androids. \r\n\r\nThe book's plot served as the primary basis for the 1982 sci-fi film [[Blade Runner]]. \r\n\r\nJapanese title: アンドロイドは電気羊の夢を見るか?\r\n\r\nh4.

She's also a brat in all versions of the meme, but it takes a couple of different forms:\r\n\r\nThe first version of her embodies the stereotypical pro-gamer. She's almost always angry, consumes a lot of McDonalds, Mountain Dew and Doritos, and is sometimes seen as a [[hikikomori|shut-in]]. \r\n\r\nOther works portray her more in line with the characters of [[bkub]]'s comics, particularly the lead characters of [i][[Poptepipic]][/i].\r\n\r\nIf not either of those, she's portrayed as the \"child\" character. Her brattiness is retained but she's now given a pseudo-family in the form of [[Soldier: 76 (overwatch)|]], or [[Mercy (overwatch)|]] and [[Pharah (overwatch)|]]. This will also take the form of fusing with the first version in a [[Doma Umaru]]-like fashion.\r\n\r\nAlso known as [b] Goblin D.va[/b].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":116710,"created_at":"2020-09-16T15:22:05.062-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-30T04:22:01.895-04:00","title":"gigi_(kamaniki)","body":"[[Virtual youtuber]] persona of [[Kamaniki]].\r\n\r\nh4.

These memes and resulting interest in the manga itself would spark a boom in [[yaoi]] and [[yuri]] content that continues on to this day. It is often paired with [[Manatsu no yo no Inmu]] (Inmu-chu) and [[gachimuchi|Gachimuchi Pants Wrestling]] as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ), since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nFor April Fools 2023, an anime \"adaptation\" of the manga was announced, entitled Shin Yaranaika, to be produced by Anime Tokyo and Studio Leo, and directed by Itou Pierre, as a medium-length all-ages OVA. Later that month, more details on the project were revealed before a crowdfunding campaign was launched to aid in funding the project.

A Ugoira is a Zip file of images, played back using a custom Javascript player.\r\n\r\nTo download a Ugoira, use the \"Save as video (right click and save)\" link beneath the image. This is a WebM conversion that can be played on regular video players, but is not lossless in quality.\r\n\r\nTo upload a Ugoira, paste the Pixiv URL into the source field on the upload page, or upload using the \"bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet]. Uploading a Ugoira file from your computer will not work.\r\n\r\nTechnically, a Ugoira consists of Zip file containing each frame in JPEG or PNG format, and a separate JSON file containing the delay between each frame. Since each frame has a separate delay, it's possible for a Ugoira to have a variable frame rate. A \"custom Javascript player\":[https://github.com/pixiv/zip_player] is used to play animations back. Since the JSON file containing the frame delays is separate from the Zip file containing the images, saving raw Ugoiras and playing them outside of a browser is difficult.\r\n\r\nUgoira is a custom format exclusive to Pixiv. Animations from other sites cannot be Ugoira.\r\n\r\nUgoira is often considered inferior to animations found on other sites due to Pixiv's limitations on uploading GIFs or MP4 videos. As a result, artists may convert their animations to GIFs before uploading, introducing [[gif artifacts|dithering]] and/or [[color banding]], and Pixiv's recompression process can introduce additional [[JPEG artifacts]], affecting the overall quality of Ugoira animations.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* topic #11108\r\n* topic #10712\r\n* [[emofuri]]\r\n* [[ugoira conversion]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["うごイラ","東方うごイラ","アニぱい","乳揺れ(うごイラ)","우고이라","動圖"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":99863,"created_at":"2018-08-01T21:01:51.307-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-27T12:21:30.275-04:00","title":"arms_under_breasts","body":"When both of a character's upper arms are underneath one or more of their breasts.\r\n\r\nOften seen with [[crossed arms]] or [[covering breasts]]\r\n\r\nWhen only one arm is under the breasts, see [[arm under breasts]].\r\n\r\nh4.
