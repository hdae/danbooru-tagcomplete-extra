His [[wrench]] is used as both a melee weapon and as a means to upgrade his buildings, and he carries a [[shotgun]] and [[handgun]] for personal defense, as well as various alternatives for each.

It was adapted into a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron and starring [[Christian Bale]] in one of his pre-[[Batman Begins]] roles.\r\n\r\nIt is a satirical psychological thriller that delves into the dark and disturbing mind of [[Patrick Bateman]]. The story is set in the 1980s during the height of the yuppie culture in [[new york city|New York City]]. It follows the perspective of Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment banker, as he navigates his high-powered job, materialistic lifestyle, and his double life where he engages in supposed acts of extreme violence, murder and sadism. \r\n\r\nThe novel is known for its graphic and explicit descriptions of violence, consumerism, and the shallow nature of 1980s society. It has sparked controversy and debate since its release and has been adapted into a film in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe film was considered a box-office disappointment but has since developed a large cult following. The film experienced a revival of popular interest in the 2020s due to its strong presence in contemporary meme culture, typically centered around Bateman's perceived \"sigma\" personality. \r\n\r\nh4.

The term itself, however, is most often used to refer to the pictograms and emoticons themselves. The word \"Emoji\" comes from the Japanese word \"絵\" ([i]e[/i], \"picture\") + \"文字\" ([i]moji[/i], \"character\"). Its resemblance to the word \"emoticon\" is purely coincidental.\r\n\r\nEmoji as we know them originated as a proprietary system by a Japanese mobile phone operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] using a Unicode private-use block to encode their emoticons. While other mobile providers used many other systems for emoji, this system was the most compact implementation used at the time (and the closest to the current one).\r\n\r\nThe very first Emoji were actually Unicode Dingbats, of which, quite a few are now official Emoji. Emoji became a standardized system with its implementation in Unicode 6.0 in 2010 but it's only around 2014-2015 that their use exploded and became commonplace to the point that they became a cultural phenomenon with real world merchandise and even a movie about them.\r\n\r\nh4.

However, Belldandy actually grants the request as a legitimate wish, and soon enough her sisters show up to see what's going on. \r\n\r\nHer older sister is [[Urd (aa megami-sama)|]], although they only share the same father, making them half sisters. Despite that, both she and her younger sister, [[Skuld (aa megami-sama)|]] don't seem to mind that, and treat Urd as if they were full blooded sisters. Belldandy's younger sister looks up to her \"oneesama\" as Belldandy seems to be the ideal goddess, although it should be noted that despite her sweet and gentle personality, Belldandy can be quite competitive and even shows signs of jealousy whenever someone gets too close to Keiichi. Still, the vast majority of the time, Belldandy remains calm and also displays a rather mature personality, even more so than some of the older goddesses and demons in the series.\r\n\r\nVoiced by [[Inoue Kikuko]].\r\n\r\nh4.

However, after Japan's surrender, the third bomb was never assembled, and the core was later studied at Los Alamos Laboratory, USA.\r\n\r\nThe core would later gain the name \"Demon core\" after two separate criticality accidents, each of which killed one scientist. The second incident involved Louis Slotin, a Canadian-American physicist, using a [[screwdriver]] to control the separation of two metallic half spheres (neutron reflectors) around the core. Upon the screwdriver slipping out, the half spheres closed completely and the assembly immediately became supercritical, releasing a burst of [[radiation]], more specifically [[Cherenkov radiation]]. This procedure specifically has became a subject of several minor memes in the Japanese community, usually to suggest a character is habitually oblivious or reckless.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, a [[meme]] revolving around the Demon Core suddenly became popular outside of Japan, possibly due to \"Kyle Hill's\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFlromB6SnU] and \"Plainly Difficult's\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE8FnsnWz48] videos covering the object.

It is a combination of three different flags: the red St. George's Cross of England, the white St. Andrew's Cross of Scotland, and the red St. Patrick's Cross of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Union Jack consists of a blue field, known as the Union Flag, with a red diagonal cross (St. Patrick's Cross) that extends from corner to corner. This cross represents [[Ireland]]. Superimposed on the diagonal cross are two intersecting crosses. The upright red diagonal cross (St. George's Cross) represents [[England]], and the white diagonal cross in the shape of an \"X\" (St. Andrew's Cross) represents [[Scotland]].\r\n\r\nThe Union Jack's design was first created in 1606 when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms but shared the same monarch, King James VI of Scotland and I of England. The flag was officially adopted in 1801 after the Act of Union, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain (combining England and Scotland) with the Kingdom of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAlso appears in the national flags of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tuvalu]], as well as those of British colonies and territories. It is also on the flag of the American state of [[Hawaii]].\r\n\r\nThis may be confused with a mecha from [[Gundam 00]] called a [[Union Flag]] used by the world superpower Union in the series.\r\n\r\nh4.
