For more information on images, see topic #26714.\r\n\r\nTo add a group of thumbnail images, write this:\r\n[code]\r\n* !post #1\r\n* !post #2\r\n* !post #3\r\n[/code]\r\nTo add captions beneath the images, write this:\r\n[code]\r\n* !post #1: This is a caption.\r\n* !post #2: Here's another caption.\r\n* !post #3: Captions can contain links, like this: [[Touhou]].\r\n[/code]\r\nTo add a single large image to a wiki (do this only for things like screenshots in help wikis, not tag wikis), write this:\r\n[code]\r\n!post #1\r\n[/code]\r\nTo add an arbitrary image that isn't from a post, first upload it, then find it on the Media Assets page, then write this:\r\n[code]\r\n* !asset #19734342: [[Ford Mustang II]] (1973-1978)\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh4. Guidelines\r\n\r\nh5. What NOT to do:\r\n\r\n* [b]No spoilers.[/b] The wiki is not the place to give away plot information. If spoilers are [i]absolutely necessary[/i] in order to describe the basis of a [[meme]] or other tag, it [b]MUST[/b] be marked properly [code][spoiler][/code] like this [code][/spoiler][/code] to make it [spoilers]like this[/spoilers].\r\n* [b]Do not make entries for nonexistent tags[/b], except to mark a tag as [[list of disambiguation pages|ambiguous]] or [[tag group:subjective|subjective]]. Do not make entries for characters or copyrights that don't have any posts. Do not make vanity entries for yourself or for other users. There are some exceptions for rules articles such as this one, or explanatory categories such as [[tag_groups]].\r\n* [b]Do not be subjective or biased.[/b] Wikis should be purely objective. Your personal feelings on the issue do not belong. Do not use words like \"stupid\", \"sexy\", \"annoying\", or \"awesome\".\r\n* [b]Do not create wiki entries without a proper understanding of the tag and its correct usage.[/b] A misleading wiki giving incorrect information to users does not help the site in any way.\r\n\r\nh5. What to do:\r\n\r\n* [b]Be concise.[/b] Provide only the basic information that someone unfamiliar with the subject needs to know. As a rule of thumb, avoid going beyond one to two short paragraphs. If possible, especially regarding characters and copyrights, provide a link to an outside website with further information for the benefit of those interested.\r\n* [b]Be relevant.[/b] Only include information that is relevant to Danbooru. The main purpose of a wiki entry is to explain how a tag is used, not to list everything you know about the topic.\r\n* [b]Use images that are as safe-for-work as possible.[/b] Blacklists currently don't apply to embedded images, so they should be safe for everybody. For NSFW wikis, at least choose images that are tasteful. \r\n* [b]Link to other wiki entries.[/b] When you mention another tag, don't forget to link to that tag's wiki entry.\r\n* [b]List other relevant links.[/b] Put links to any other relevant tags or outside websites in a \"[b]See also[/b]\" section at the bottom of the entry.\r\n\r\nh5. Character wiki guidelines:\r\n\r\n* [b]List the copyright.[/b] Don't forget to mention which copyright the character is from.\r\n* [b]Describe the character's appearance.[/b] Be descriptive enough that someone unfamiliar with the character will be able to recognize and tag that character.\r\n* [b]List the character's name in kanji/kana.[/b] This is helpful for translators.\r\n* [b]Use correct naming conventions.[/b] Characters are tagged in the way they are written in their native languages, thus [[kinomoto_sakura|Kinomoto Sakura]], not Sakura Kinomoto. This \"original order\" policy carries over from tagging into wiki writing as well as translation notes.\r\n* [b]List other relevant tags.[/b] Be sure to list any other tags that relate to the character. These may include alternate versions of the character, [[genderswap|genderswaps]], [[parody|parodies]], and so on.\r\n\r\nh5. Copyright wiki guidelines:\r\n\r\n* [b]Provide a brief synopsis.[/b] A short synopsis to provide some context is helpful, but [b]do not[/b] describe the plot in detail and [b]do not[/b] provide spoilers.\r\n* [b]List related characters.[/b] List any characters that are involved in the copyright. Do not list characters that don't have any posts. \r\n* [b]List related copyrights.[/b] List any related sequels, prequels, or spin-offs.\r\n* [b]Refer to series using the name Danbooru uses.[/b] For example, use [[hayate_no_gotoku!|Hayate no Gotoku!]] in a wiki, not Hayate the Combat Butler. It may be appropriate to mention alternate or translated titles, but use our tag as the primary. Don't italicize the name.\r\n\r\nh5. Artist wiki guidelines:\r\n\r\n* [b]Don't create unnecessary pages.[/b] For artist tags, there is the \"artist library\":/artist. See [[help:artists|how to use]].\r\n* [b]Create pages without duplicating information.[/b] Sometimes it is required to specify additional information, then a wiki-page of the same name is created for the tag. Don't write a list of links and alternative names or nicknames. Use the artist library. \r\n\r\nh4.

Uploading\r\n\r\nTo upload from Twitter, paste a link to the tweet on the \"upload page\":[/uploads/new], like this:\r\n\r\n* https://danbooru.donmai.us/uploads/new?url=https://twitter.com/weirdlilguys/status/1755223245614150080\r\n\r\nDon't paste a direct link to the image, like this:\r\n\r\n* https://danbooru.donmai.us/uploads/new?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFvOPQpW0AAR0A4.jpg\r\n\r\nIf you paste a direct link to the image, then Danbooru won't be able to find which tweet it belongs to, and won't be able to pull the artist, tags, and commentary.\r\n\r\nh4. Image quality\r\n\r\nSince December 11th, 2019, Twitter won't compress or downscale images unless the image is bigger than 4096x4096, more than 5MB large, or it has [[exif rotation]] or very inefficient compression (\"[1]\":[https://twitter.com/NolanOBrien/status/1204557498990002176], \"[2]\":[https://twitter.com/NolanOBrien/status/1204842518208057344]).\r\n\r\nThis means that Twitter uploads usually have the same quality as Pixiv uploads.\r\n\r\nImages posted before December 11th, 2019 were always compressed or downscaled (except for PNG with alpha channel), so Twitter images from this time period were generally lower quality than Pixiv images.\r\n\r\nh4.

If if doesn't, then you can use https://tweeterid.com to determine a user's Twitter ID, or use the following bookmarklet:\r\n\r\n[expand=Bookmarklet to show ID]\r\n[code]\r\njavascript:(() => {prompt('Twitter ID', `https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=${JSON.parse(document.querySelector(%27script[data-testid=%22UserProfileSchema-test%22]%27)?.textContent)?.author?.identifier}`)})()\r\n[/code]\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nSee [[help:artists]] for more information about artist entries.\r\n\r\nh4.

Danbooru can compare the Other Name entries with the tags listed on the external site and list the corresponding Danbooru tags under a \"translated\" column in the Related Tags section when uploading.\r\n\r\nh4. Setting up a tag\r\n\r\nIn order for the translated tags feature to work for a tag, the tag's wiki page must have the corresponding names from external sites set. To set these, find the tag's wiki page and go to edit it. If it doesn't have a wiki, create one. In the [b]Other names[/b] field, put the name(s) that other sites use for this tag, separated by spaces.\r\n\r\nFor example, the [[original]] wiki has オリジナル in its Other names, because オリジナル is the Japanese term for original works and is used on sites such as Pixiv.\r\n\r\nh4. Using translated tags\r\n\r\nIn order to use translated tags when uploading, you should use the \"official upload bookmarklet\":/static/bookmarklet. If you do, the site will automatically fetch data from the source you're uploading from, and then provide a list of translated tags in the Related Tags section under \"translated\", which you can click to add each one.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the bookmarklet to upload, you can instead manually click \"Fetch source data\" (you must first put the source URL in the Source field). You can use the same \"Fetch source data\" link to use translated tags on a post that has already been uploaded, in the Edit section. However, this method doesn't work with all sites that the bookmarklet does.\r\n\r\nCurrently, sites that work with translated tags are: Pixiv, Nico Seiga, and Nijie (bookmarklet only).\r\n\r\nh4. What to put in the wiki Other names field\r\n\r\n* Character and copyright names in other languages.\r\n* General tags used on other sites only if they correspond exactly to a tag on Danbooru.\r\n\r\nBe careful not to add names that sound similar, but in practice are used very differently on other sites.\r\n\r\nh4. What Not to put in the wiki Other names field\r\n\r\n* An artist's other names. These should go in the artist entry's other names field instead of the wiki's.

It is best known as an alternative to [[Twitter]] for posting NSFW art, especially [[loli]], [[shota]], and [[toddlercon]].\r\n\r\nOn pawoo (and other instances of Mastodon), 'tweets' are referred to as 'toots', 'likes' are referred to as 'favorites' and 'retweets' are referred to as 'boosts'.\r\n\r\nThis page will describe how to sign up and upload from Pawoo, in addition to how to handle new artist entries in the case an entry doesn't already exist for the artist you're uploading a work from.\r\n\r\nh4. Word of caution\r\n\r\nUploading from pawoo is unadvised for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* All jpg images are resampled (albeit at a lower rate than Twitter)\r\n* All images are currently configured to be resized to a maximum of 1280x1280, much smaller than what Twitter allows.\r\n\r\nYou should always look for a better image source off another site such as pixiv or nicoseiga if it is available ([[help:image source]]).\r\n\r\nh4. Signing up\r\n\r\nPawoo will not allow you to view links to the timeline if you do not have an account. That includes links like these:\r\n\r\n* https://pawoo.net/web/accounts/8525\r\n* https://pawoo.net/web/statuses/33721\r\n\r\nThe interface now has an English interface that also allows you to sign up with your pixiv account, so signing up should be fairly straightforward.\r\n\r\nh4. Uploading\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Upload with the \"danbooru bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], or paste in the toot URL of the work you wish to upload in the upload page. This way, you don't have to upload the image from your computer. If you wish to upload multiple images, use the batch bookmarklet. The link to a toot should look something like this:\r\n\r\n* https://pawoo.net/@maaya/33721\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the HTML URL to the toot is much more preferred than that of the direct image URL to the tweet for various reasons. Artist information and commentary, for example, are readily available to pull from the image source if the tweet has not been taken down yet.\r\n\r\nThe upload page will [b]NOT[/b] always correct your source to the HTML link for you. Remember to correct it yourself when it so happens.\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Use the artist tag detected under [b]Related Tags[/b], if there is one. If there is none, you may refer to the rest of this article on how to choose an artist name and make an entry for them, or correct their artist entry if they have changed their twitter handle.\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] Remember to [[howto:tag|tag]] the rest of your upload and follow the rest of the procedures under [[help:upload]]. If the source is not fixed after your upload has completed, you will have to fix it yourself.\r\n\r\nh4. Artist entries\r\n\r\nMost pawoo users will have a pixiv account, usually listed somewhere in their profile. If not that, they they may also have a twitter account to reference. In cases like these, see [[howto:pixiv]] or [[howto:twitter]].

Luckily, Nijie does not actually have samples in case you decide not to go this route, but it is still highly recommended. The bookmarklet works from both [code]view.php[/code] and [code]view_popup.php[/code] pages. If you wish to upload multiple images, use the batch bookmarklet.\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Use the artist tag detected under [b]Related Tags[/b], if there is one.

Artist naming\r\n\r\nRule of thumb is: Make a [b]simple, readable, and memorizable[/b] tag.\r\n\r\nThe first choice is to use the artist's real name if you can find it on any websites or blogs listed on their nijie profile. See [[help:artists]] for advice on finding the artist's name on their website.\r\n\r\nMany artists also have [[pixiv]] accounts in addition to their Nijie account. Refer to [[howto:pixiv]] for more information in the case you find one.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a name, [[howto:romanize|romanize it]]. Name kanji often have several different readings, so it's best to use any available indicators (such as their twitter handle) on how to read the name. If you don't know how to read this name or are unsure of the correct reading, post in topic #8199 to ask for help.\r\n\r\nNote that Nijie nicknames are not necessarily unique. If it is too generic (\"Ken\", \"Daisuke\", \"Youko\", etc.), add a qualifier to make it unique. Good choices for qualifiers include:\r\n\r\n* The artist's circle name\r\n** e.g. [[gurande_(g-size)]]\r\n* The artist's twitter handle\r\n** e.g. [[oyamada_(pi0v0jg)]]\r\n* If nothing else exists, their nijie ID\r\n** This is a very rare case, and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nh5. Things to note\r\n\r\n* [b]Do not[/b] use non-ASCII characters for the artist's name, even if they look like ASCII letters--Ｒｙｕ is not the same as Ryu. Save that for the \"Other names\" field.\r\n* [b]Do not[/b] use \"_(nijie)\" or \"_(artist)\" as the qualifier. There are probably a dozen Nijie artists named Sakura or Miki, so those qualifiers are simply not effective.\r\n* [b]Try not to[/b] make a hard to read name like [[ken_(oooxvbgj)]].\r\n\r\nh4. Artist entries\r\n\r\nTo create or edit an artist entry, click the '?' next to the artist tag in the tag list. In the artist entry, add:\r\n\r\nh6. Other Names\r\n* The artist's Nijie nickname (found under their profile picture).\r\n* Any other account names, Twitter handles, or nicknames on other sites the artist lists in their profile.\r\n\r\nh6.
