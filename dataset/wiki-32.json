Episode 1\r\n\r\nEpisode 1, the first novel released, centers on the characters [[Chocola (nekopara)|]] and [[Vanilla (nekopara)|]], whom the main character lives with, sleeps with and eventually has sex with. While Chocola and Vanilla are the main characters, the novel also includes a supporting cast of four other cat girls and the player character's sister.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 2\r\n\r\nEpisode 2, the third novel released, adds [[Coconut (nekopara)|]] and [[Azuki (nekopara)|]] to the center character group. The two were formerly members of the supporting cast. \r\n\r\nh6. Episode 3\r\n\r\nEpisode 3, the fourth novel released, focuses on [[Cinnamon (nekopara)|]] and [[Maple (nekopara)|]]. As with [[Coconut (nekopara)|]] and [[Azuki (nekopara)|]] before them, they started as supporting characters.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 4\r\n\r\nThe fifth novel released, Episode 4 focuses on the player character [[Minazuki Kashou]] and his family, exploring his past.

It is a combination of three different flags: the red St. George's Cross of England, the white St. Andrew's Cross of Scotland, and the red St. Patrick's Cross of Ireland.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking, a [i]jack[/i] is a flag displayed by a ship, so the name \"Union Jack\" is incorrect when the Union Flag appears in any other context, but popular usage, as is so often the case, defeats technical correctness in everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Union Jack consists of a blue field, known as the Union Flag, with a red diagonal cross (St. Patrick's Cross) that extends from corner to corner. This cross represents [[Ireland]]. Superimposed on the diagonal cross are two intersecting crosses. The upright red diagonal cross (St. George's Cross) represents [[England]], and the white diagonal cross in the shape of an \"X\" (St. Andrew's Cross) represents [[Scotland]].\r\n\r\nThe Union Jack's design was first created in 1606 when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms but shared the same monarch, King James VI of Scotland and I of England. The flag was officially adopted in 1801 after the Act of Union, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain (combining England and Scotland) with the Kingdom of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAlso appears in the national flags of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tuvalu]], as well as those of British colonies and territories. It is also on the flag of the American state of [[Hawaii]].\r\n\r\nThis may be confused with a mecha from [[Gundam 00]] called a [[Union Flag]] used by the world superpower Union in the series.\r\n\r\nh4.

Galbraith writes that Cream Lemon \"was by far the longest running and most influential\" hentai series in the 1980s and \"laid the foundation for pornographic animation in Japan\".\r\n\r\nRelated to Cream Lemon is the [[Project A-ko]] franchise, which was meant to be the third installment of Cream Lemon but changed during production to be a mainstream film. The only remaining indication is the bath scene with B-ko. Adult entertainment company Excalibur Films dubbed, edited, and released in English five Cream Lemon OVAs as parts two and three of their three-volume Brothers Grime X-Rated Cartoons series in 1987 and 1989. In 1987, Brazilian distributor Everest Video licensed the series and released much of it on VHS, in uncensored form.\r\n\r\nCream Lemon is a collection of sometimes surreal stories having different settings and situations, with genres including [[fantasy]], comedy, suspense, sci-fi, action, drama, [[mecha]], magical girl, horror, and mystery. The overriding theme of the series is sex of almost any kind imaginable. Most chapters stand alone as separate titles, having no relation to any other stories within the Cream Lemon series. The main recurring character is Ami Nonomura, who has an incestuous relationship with her step-brother Hiroshi.\r\n\r\nCream Lemon often focuses on unrealistic and exaggerated sexual themes. One example is the story of a teenage girl who does not like having sex because of a series of rapes in her family. To cure this, the school counselor orders her to strip in front of the art class and masturbate herself to the point of orgasm. She then has public sex with a boy and likes it, causing the whole class to start having sex. Many others are similarly surreal.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["くりいむレモン","くりぃむレモン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206623,"created_at":"2024-09-04T19:58:52.878-04:00","updated_at":"2025-06-11T04:25:07.795-04:00","title":"elysia_(summer_2024)_(honkai_impact)","body":"The current swimsuit [[official alternate costume]] of [[Honkai Impact 3rd]]'s [[Elysia (honkai impact)|]], exclusive to her [[Elysia (Herrscher of Human: Ego) (Honkai Impact)|Herrscher of Human: Ego]] form. \r\n\r\nReleased as part of the game's Summer merchandise lineup for 2024 involving the Thirteen Flamechasers, her current swimsuit consists of a [[two-tone shirt|two-tone]] [[purple shirt|purple]]-[[white shirt|white]] [[print shirt]] [[tied shirt|tied to the front]], [[white buruma]], [[white sarong]], [[white socks]], and [[purple footwear|purple]] [[sandals]].

He was posthumously dubbed Vlad the Impaler (modern Romanian: Vlad Țepeș, pronounced [ˈvlad ˈt͡sepeʃ]) due to his habit of impaling his enemy's corpses. He is well known for his resistance against the [[Ottoman Empire]].\r\n\r\nThe name of the vampire Count [[Dracula]] in Bram Stoker's 1897 novel [[Bram Stoker's Dracula|Dracula]] was derived from William Wilkinson's book [i]An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia[/i], where he makes reference to both Vlad III and his father, Vlad II Dracul, as \"Voïvode Dracula\", with Stoker copying in his notes the footnote on the name, where it revealed its meaning of 'devil', and that it was given \"as a surname to any person who rendered himself conspicuous either by courage, cruel actions, or cunning.\" This has inspired later authors, prior to Stoker's own notes becoming public, to associate the historical Vlad III with the vampire Count Dracula, with several Dracula-based fictions (e.g. [[Castlevania (series)|]] series, [[Hellsing]], etc.) regarding them as the same person, despite the original novel itself dismissing the association after introducing it later on.\r\n\r\nh4.

The original idea for the game stems from a one page sketch by the artist [[Honjou Raita]]. A translated version of the page (post #22437) was posted on 4chan on January 4, 2007. The post received a huge response and eventually a group of people emerged that was highly dedicated to realizing the creation of the game. These people formed Four Leaf Studios and continued to work on it. \r\n\r\nh4.

Therefore you should know the tagging standards we expect from you.\r\n* Check out high-scoring posts (search: {{score:>50 gentags:>20}}), as highly scored posts tend to also be well-tagged, and some not-so-good tagging (search: {{tagme}}).\r\n* Read the [[howto:tag|Tagging Guidelines]].

Posts (Uploading)\r\n\r\nPosts are the blood and bone of Danbooru. We pride ourselves for having the best picture collection on the internet, and we expect you to maintain the standard. Before you upload anything, we would like you to:\r\n* Read the Upload Rules. See \"How to Danbooru\":#dtext-how-to-danbooru above.\r\n* Know the upload [[about:mod_queue|Moderation Process]]\r\n\r\nOther useful things to know about:\r\n* The [[howto:appeal|Deletion Appeal]] process.\r\n* The upload feedback thread: topic #7934.\r\n\r\nMore Protips:\r\n* Remember to tag what you upload. All new posts are expected to be tagged to at least Level 1 per the [[howto:tag_checklist|Tag Checklist]].\r\n* It is a good idea to learn how to tag (see above) before uploading.\r\n* If you don't know where to start, from time to time Approvers will submit under-posted artists to the Upload Bounty Thread: topic #24186.\r\n\r\nh4. Rating \r\n\r\nPlease help out by making sure that all posts are properly rated. This is required for \"Donmai.moe\":[https://donmai.moe] to work properly.\r\n\r\n* Read the [[howto:rate|Rating Guidelines]] for rating sexual content.\r\n* Extreme violence or depictions of body mutilation must be tagged with the [[guro]] tag.\r\n\r\nJust to get into the right kind of thinking:\r\n* Posts with a general rating ({{rating:g}}) would be things you could show to someone in public.\r\n* Posts with a sensitive rating ({{rating:s}}) would be things you will be comfortable viewing in art class in high school.\r\n* donmai.moe only displays posts with a rating of general.

Nothing personal should be posted.\r\n\r\n[[help:bulk_update_requests|Bulk Update Requests]] allow you to formally propose changes to tags on the forum.
