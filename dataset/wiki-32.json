However, there are other variations, including one well-known recipe which uses Worcestershire sauce and shredded cabbage. To differentiate the two, the former is sometimes called \"[i]Tamago-toji [bound-together-with-egg] katsudon[/i],\" whereas the latter is called \"[i]Sauce Katsudon[/i].\"\r\n\r\nA common trope in Japanese crime dramas is for the detective to eat katsudon while interrogating a suspect. The typical heart-of-gold type detective would think, \"if this guy goes to the slammer, he'd never be able to eat anything as good as this again,\" and then use his own coin to order a katsudon delivered straight to the suspect's house. Then the suspect would be moved so much as to turn himself in and confess to the crime, tears streaming down his face. And so goes the cliche. For these stories, there is an explanation that katsudon was the most expensive food that one could get on a police officer's salary. \r\n\r\nThis is nowadays only seen as a joke or stereotype, but Japanese people have come up with the expression, \"let someone eat katsudon,\" which carries the same meaning as \"read someone their Miranda rights\" (see post #1184509).\r\n\r\nh4.

Personality and trivia\r\nAs she is based on an experimental destroyer built around speed and heavy torpedo armaments, Shimakaze sports a boastful personality, occasionally bragging about how fast she is and nitpick on how \"slow\" those around her are. In spite of this, due to the historical counterpart only experienced few combat actions (being mostly used as an escort), Shimakaze also have a lazy, \"spoiled brat\" altitude, being generally carefree and minding her own business rather than the others.\r\n\r\nWhile the historical ship is the fastest bluewater ship in the IJN fleet, she is not the fastest destroyer in the game after the inclusion of [[Tashkent (kancolle)|]] around 2018. After this, Shimakaze is often depicted in fan works as either losing her confidence or viewed Tashkent as a rival she swears to surpass.\r\n\r\nDue to her distinctive and revealing outfit, she has become one of the most popular characters of the series, with several artists often drawing the other characters [[cosplay]] [[shimakaze (kancolle) (cosplay)|as her]]. She is also frequently portrayed as an [[otoko no ko]] ([[Shimakaze-kun]]) or as an unrelated boy [[crossdressing]] as her.\r\n\r\nHer fan nickname is [i]Zekamashi[/i], Shimakaze spelled backwards due to pre-1946 Japanese orthography reading horizontal writing right-to-left, after it was written on an [[innertube]] on a Rensouhou-chan.\r\n\r\nCharacter design by [[Shizuma Yoshinori]], voiced by [[Sakura Ayane]].\r\n\r\nh4.

He is known for being one of the easiest bosses for Kirby to fight - He's a (usually) stationary tree that drops apples on Kirby to attack, so all Kirby has to do is inhale the apples that drop and spit them back at him while standing next to him to avoid the air bullets he spits out. Whispy has appeared in many games ever since the very first one and sometimes takes a spot other than Level 1 in a game, and sometimes even changes strategy and gains new attacks, but that doesn't make him any tougher. A similar boss named King Golem who appears in Kirby & The Amazing Mirror also shares the same attack pattern as Whispy.\r\n\r\nIn the [[kirby:_right_back_at_ya|anime]], Whispy takes a different role. Instead of being a major enemy, Whispy serves as an ally to Kirby and his friends. He is very kind to his friends, yet shows no mercy to those who threaten his kingdom and forest. At first, he thought Kirby and his friends were intruders and tried to crush them as punishment. But after realizing [[King Dedede]] used him, Whispy becomes Kirby's friend while Dedede tries many times to cut down his forest (yet fails every time). In the [[Super Smash Bros.]] games, Whispy appears in the background, often minding his own business before taking deep breaths and then blowing strong winds that push players close to the edges of the Kirby stages he is placed in.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see his \"wiki page\":https://wikirby.com/wiki/Whispy_Woods.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ウィスピーウッズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":221713,"created_at":"2025-01-13T22:03:45.861-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-25T22:50:47.619-05:00","title":"shiori_novella_(casual)","body":"The 3rd [[official alternate costume|costume]] of [[hololive English|hololive EN]]'s [[Shiori Novella]].\r\n\r\nIt's a [[detective]]-themed costume, she wears a removable [[black capelet]], a [[red dress|red]] [[frilled dress]] with a [[black corset]], [[fishnet pantyhose]] and [[black footwear|black]] [[shoes]].\r\n\r\nShe has 2 different [[official alternate hairstyle|official hairstyles]] in this costume:\r\n* [[Medium hair|Medium-length hair]] with [[swept bangs]] and a [[black hat|black]] [[deerstalker]]\r\n* [[Long hair]] tied into a [[ponytail]]\r\n\r\nh4.

When [[Sun Ce]] was assassinated, Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the Yangtze River from his brother. \r\n\r\nIn winter of 207, the northern warlord [[Cao Cao]] led an army of approximately 220,000 to conquer the south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by [[Zhang Zhao]], urged surrender whilst the other, led by [[Zhou Yu]] and [[Lu Su]] and with support from a diplomatic mission by [[Zhuge Liang]], opposed Cao Cao. Eventually Sun Quan decided to ally with Liu Bei and employing the combined strategies of Zhou Yu and [[Huang Gai]], they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn late 220, [[Cao Pi]], King of Wei, Cao Cao's son and successor, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the Emperor of China, ending and succeeding the nominal rule of the Han dynasty. At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Wei vassal with the Wei-created title of King of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son [[Sun Deng]] as a hostage to the Wei capital Luoyang and he refused and declared himself independent by changing his era name. It was not until May 229 that he formally declared himself emperor.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his original crown prince, Sun Deng, two opposing factions supporting different potential successors slowly emerged. Sun Quan harshly settled the conflict between the two factions by exiling [[Sun He]] and forcing [[Sun Ba]] to commit suicide. Sun Quan died in May 252 at the age of 70 (by East Asian reckoning). He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms and was succeeded by his son, [[Sun Liang]]. \r\n\r\nh4.
