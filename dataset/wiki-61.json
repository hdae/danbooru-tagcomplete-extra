The titular video was released in 2001 by Coat Corporation, but the term has expanded to include other works by other companies like Acceed, Samson Video, etc.\r\n\r\nThe meme originally started around mid-2005, after the Japanese baseball player [[Tadano Kazuhito]] was involved in a scandal after his past identity as one of the gay porn actors in the original [i]Inmu[/i] movie was leaked. Leading to his dismissial from the Japanese baseball league and subsequent move to the United States.\r\n\r\nIt's often paired with [[gachimuchi|Gachimuchi Pants Wrestling]] (Wrestling Series) and [[kuso miso technique|Shit Soup Technique]] ([[Yaranaika]]) as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ) since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s. However, when [[Niconico]] emerged in the late 2000s, it was considered an arch-enemy of [[Gachimuchi]] and fans would often flame each other's videos. While Gachimuchi would become popular internationally and more recognized after several Gachi MADs were uploaded (and re-uploaded) on [[YouTube]], it would later be supplanted by Inmu on Nico Nico Douga and within the Japanese community after more videos of [[Yajuu Senpai]] were uncovered around the 2010s.\r\n\r\nFans typically refer to an actor in one of the works by an initialism of their name (e.g. Tadano -> TDN, Yajuu Senpai -> YJSNPI, etc.) with either \"Aniki\" (兄貴, lit. \"Big Brother\") or \"Aneki\" (姉貴, lit. \"Big Sister\") attached to them at the end, corresponding to the actor's gender. This is called \"TDN Notation\" (TDN表記).\r\n\r\nInmu is often linked with the [[Cookie (Touhou)|Cookie☆]] series of [[Touhou]] memes, after they latched onto the original video that started the meme (even coining the name it now uses), and the developments thereafter relating to said video.\r\n\r\nh4.

The column advised women to act ditzy and cute by doing things like pretending not to be able to eat [[omurice]] because of feeling bad about the chick dying when the eggs are broken.\r\n\r\n\"Four techniques for improving girls with girl power from such things as 'Attracting guys by being a woman who won't even eat an omelet.'\":http://youpouch.com/2011/04/26/162331/ - August 26, 2011\r\n\r\n[expand=Translated article]Hello, I am Lady Ebios a specialist in love management. I am an ugly person without an academic history or much common sense, but when it comes to love I am a professional. This time I think I should teach everyone about the four ways to improve women by using girl power.\r\n\r\n1. Taking your two to three generations old [[cellphone]] to drinking parties\r\n\r\nLets make use of the two to three generations old cellphone. So at a drinking party talk to a man you like, and try to bring out your cellphone on purpose. Then say \"Aww, I really hate using this cellphone!\", it will make the man say \"What's wrong.\" If he says this its been a big success. Say something like \"I don't know much about cellphones~! I've been using this one for so long~! Its so hard to use! [b]Punpukuriin![/b] (Anger).\" Since men usually want to have new cellphones, even if its old they are at least using last generations cellphones.\r\n\r\nWith that the man will definitely say \"Why don't you buy a new one?\" (Guys who don't say this and can't read the situation should in that moment be ignored and then move on). Then you will respond with \"Well well~! Isn't the new iPhone5 popular-!? How is it? I want a new one but have no idea!! I'm so pitiful ★.\" Then the man will start to say \"The iPhone4 right? They haven't made the 5 yet. You really don't know much do you. What kind do you want?\" Then the next day off both of you will go on a date to choose cellphones. If your girl power is strong, then the guy might possibly buy the cellphone for you!?\r\n\r\n2. Being able to use [[> <]] on Twitter\r\n\r\nThings like \"Ah-!\" or \"I'm sad\" can be expressed with \"[[> <]]\" in comments, and then the Twitter's male users will think \"This girl is kind of cute\" or \"I kind of want to help her.\" Images on the internet are more applicable to other users rather than in the world like having many uses for \"[[> <]]\" which will mistakenly make men think you are a pitiful woman. If you become this kind of character almost always ignore that you will be hated by the same sex.\r\n\r\n3. For the time being always say to guys \"Really-! What is that!? Tell me tell me. ♪\"\r\n\r\nGuys always talk about nothing but bragging and their hobbies when talking to girls at things like drinking parties. Thus, for girls its always a boring story. However, if you respond with the usual responses like \"Wow, really~?\" or \"I don't really get it, but that's amazing,\" then the guy will notice that \"This girl is no good.\" If you are revealed as a girl with not merit its over. It is then instead to say unintentionally with a lot of spirit, \"Really-! What is that!? Tell me Tell me ♪.\" For instance, even its not a story about interests, then get through the situation with high spirits and positivity. Men have a weakness for women that will assertively listen to them talk.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to different stories, then comment with something like \"something, something, something right! Oh, I just remembered! Memo Memo!\" and it will be perfect. Continuing on, point at your head and spin your finger around saying \"[b]Kyun kyun kyun! Kyun kyun kyun![/b]\" \"What's wrong?\" the guy might say. Then if you say \"I am just recording it to my hard disk\" your girl power will go up! With this the guy will again think \"Wow this girl is interesting and cute!?\" I don't have any academic history or much knowledge and I am ugly, but with if I use this kind of technique then even my non knowledgeable self that is a stupid woman can be popular. All because men want to feel like they are superior.\r\n\r\n4. Attracting guys by being a woman who won't even eat [[omurice]] in a restaurant\r\n\r\nIf you go into a restaurant with a man, find the first thing you can with [[omurice]] or eggs in it and say \"A-w! I can't even eat this~ (Sadness).\" Then 100 percent he will ask \"Why not? Do you not like it?\" and you will respond with \"I don't not like it, I just can't eat it [[> <]].\" Again 100 percent he will ask \"Since you don't not like it why can't you eat it?\" and you will look down for 3~5 seconds and in between then say idly \"...well,...well, if you break an egg then won't the chick die! Its so sad! It isn't even born yet~(Sadness). It won't even be able to chirp....\" and shake a little while saying this.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, your girl power will go up. The man will definitely be charmed by you and from the bottom of his heart vow that \"You are such a nice angelic like person! I will definitely get her! She is going to be my woman!\" In the man's mind once you start dating, then forget about that sort of thing and only if you like it then it's okay to eat omelets. If he says \"Didn't you say that you couldn't eat it?\" then its okay to say something like \"It's okay to eat it now\" or \"I've gotten used to it,\" or \"I've never said that.\"\r\n\r\n(Article = Love management by Lady Ebios)\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nThis article has a sequel.

You also have a family of your own to take care of, I'm guessing...\")[/tn]\r\n\r\n--Guile, [[Street Fighter II (series)|]]\r\n\r\n[b]Guile[/b] ([b]ガイル[/b]) is a video game character in [[capcom|Capcom's]] [[Street Fighter]] series of fighting games. Although his role in the Street Fighter story is minimal, he is considered the third leading male character in the series, after [[Ryu (street fighter)|]] and [[ken masters|Ken]], largely due to his effectiveness as a character and his popularity.\r\n\r\nWhen Guile was a Lieutenant in the United States Air Force, he befriended his superior officer, [[charlie nash|Charlie]] and asked him to teach him in his unique form of fighting, which Charlie agreed to do. Guile learned the style, but his hot temper caused him to be not as proficient in the moves as Charlie was (shown in how Charlie can shoot Sonic Booms with just one hand while Guile needs both.)\r\n\r\nGuile has a wife, [[Julia (street fighter)|]] (ユリア), and daughter, [[Chris (street fighter)|]] (クリス, known as Amy internationally). Also, Julia and [[eliza masters|Eliza]] are actually sisters, making Ken and Guile brothers-in-law. However, this is not often discussed because, despite mutual respect as fighters, they do not think very highly of one another — Guile believes Ken to be a spoiled rich kid; Ken feels Guile is just another meathead soldier. In [[Street Fighter IV (series)|]], if Ken beats Guile, he'll refer to him as his \"brother-in-law\". \r\n\r\nThere's a [[meme|running gag]] about his theme music from Street Fighter II \"fitting in\" or \"going with\" every scene or moment imaginable.\r\nAlso, a meme called [b]Waiting Guile (待ちガイル)[/b] refers to the strategy wherein the player crouches in the corner waiting for the opponent to approach, only to then hit them with either one of his charge moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for his character comes from [[rudolph von stroheim|JoJo's Rudolph von Stroheim]].\r\n\r\nh4.

They can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat colour or combination of colours (including [[white cat|white]]).\r\n\r\nOriginally called [b]lop-eared[/b] or [b]lops[/b] after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as [b]Highland Fold[/b], [b]Scottish Fold Longhair[/b], [b]Longhair Fold[/b] and [b]Coupari[/b].\r\n\r\nAll Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia, a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the ear fold in the breed and studies point to all Fold cats being affected by it. Fold cats therefore have malformed bone structures and can develop severe painful degenerative joint diseases at an early age. Due to these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several countries and some major cat registries do not recognise the cat breed.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her [[single knee pad]] is now a full-on greave and her pantyhose is open at three toes each foot. Her [[headband]] is changed to one akin to the Japan Post emblem: a hinomaru flanked by a single red stripe.\r\n\r\nKai Ni reverts her to her pink color scheme, but Kai Ni E portrays her in her real-life green [[camouflage]]. \r\n\r\nIn both cases, her second remodels correct the historical deficiencies of the original Ryuuhou (as reflected in [[Ryuuhou Kai (Kancolle)|her kai form]]) by boasting double the plane capacity and slightly better armor values. However, she requires a prototype catapult for the first second remodel (Kai to Kai Ni E) as she never historically received further upgrades after mid-1944.\r\n\r\nh4.

Slow and obsolete, the 1930s-era \"Stringbag\" nevertheless achieved some spectacular successes during its service life, which extended all the way to 1946.
