During this time, ghosts and spirits of the dead arose from their resting places and attacked a rural Chinese village.\r\n\r\nAfter their mother was killed by a powerful demon, she and her sister decided to use Tensei-no-Jutsu to save her, but they used a prohibited sub-division of this technique, Igyo Tenshin-no-Jutsu, and fought to release their mother's soul from the dark. This turned the twins into a [[jiangshi]] (僵屍), a type of Chinese vampire. This, however, also gave the two unusual abilities that later makes Hsien-ko capable of wielding a pair of giant [[mechanical arms]] which the two use to fight for their purposes.

Its principal task during its early years as a government-owned corporation was to repair and aid in the recovery of rail lines in the American Northeast and lower Great Lakes, neglected after their previous owners suffered decreasing revenue between stifling regulation and intensive competition from trucks and aircraft. Much of its early years would be spent shedding unprofitable branch lines and carrying out desperately-needed repairs on major rail arteries. The company would eventually turn a profit in the 1980s and be privatized shortly thereafter. Conrail as an independent entity would last until 1999, when it was split between the CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern. The company exists to the present day, albeit as a \"shared assets organization\" managed jointly by CSX and NS to handle freight traffic in and around the ports in the New York City area. \r\n\r\nThe company is remembered by American railfans for its particular origins, unique power (being the only railroad to order the EMD SD80MAC and having briefly run electrified operations in its early years), blue livery, and \"can opener\" logo.\r\n\r\nh4.

In Gongshou Li, the fingers cup the fist, and in Baoquan Li, the fingers are held straight out.\r\n\r\nGongshou Li (拱手礼), also know as [i]Fist and palm salute[/i], is a formal greeting etiquette in ancient China. It is commonly used in daily occasions (meeting and parting, when offering thanks or apologies). This greeting consists of a half-fist held in the palm of the other hand at stomach level, while [[bowing]] slightly to deeply depending on how much respect they want to convey.\r\n\r\nNote that for males, the right-hand makes the fist and the left hand is on top. For females, it's the opposite. At a funeral, the greeting is done on the other way around: right-hand on top for men and left-hand on top for women.\r\n\r\nBaoquan Li (抱拳礼) also know as [i]Kung Fu Salute[/i], [i]Hold palm salute[/i] or [i]Hold fist salute[/i], is a common etiquette derived from (but not exclusive to) Chinese martial arts. It shows the humility and often widely used among the kung fu masters and students. This salute is generally characterized by an open left hand placed next to a closed right fist. The importance is that the fingers on the left hand should stay extended and not flexed to cover the right fist.\r\n\r\nh4.

The HMS [i]Monarch[/i] seen in both games is based off of a design proposal for what would become the [i]King George V[/i]-class battleships, armed with three 381 mm triple gun mounts.

She is one of many \"Friends\" in Japari Park. Part of [[penguins_performance_project_(kemono_friends)|Penguins Performance Project]] as \"Hululu\". She is typically presented as an airhead with a bottomless stomach, and is usually seen munching on a [[Japari Bun]] when idle.\r\n\r\nHululu wears a black and white jacket patterned after a Humboldt penguin's speckled plumage, with sleeves ending in mittens as to evoke flippers. The earpieces of her headphones bear a pattern evoking the eyes of the actual penguin. As the bottom of her coat covers her lower half, she [[no_pants|appears to wear no bottoms]], though she may wear something similar to [[emperor_penguin_(kemono_friends)|Emperor Penguin]]'s leotard underneath. She has short black hair with some bangs being tipped pink; her center bangs feature two white spots.\r\n\r\nAs her design bears numerous similarities to that of her bandmate [[Humboldt Penguin (Kemono Friends)]] (Hululu), the two are sometimes mixed up by taggers. While one should be conscious of artistic liberties and stylistic differences, some reliable distinguishing details to check for include:\r\n\r\n* hair length <i>(Hululu has shoulder-length hair, Gean's extends past her ribcage)</i>\r\n\r\n* default outfit <i>(Gean has a ruffled skirt; Hululu doesn't wear one, and her lower half is covered by her long jacket. Additionally, Gean's jacket has a black collar with pull-cords; Hululu has a white collar with no cords.)</i>\r\n\r\n* default headphones <i>(Hululu's headband is obscured by her hair at the top; Gean's is fully visible. Additionally, the design on Hululu's earpiece makes a \"ç\" shape, where Gean's makes a fully-closed ring.)</i>\r\n\r\n* bangs <i>(Gean has red streaks (sometimes depicted as a red-pink) <b>on the sides of her center bang, usually depicted from the middle to the tip.</b> Hululu has light pink patches <b>on the bangs <u>flanking</u> the top of her center bang</b>; her center bang just has two white dots.)</i>\r\n\r\nIn 2021, a [[virtual YouTuber]] based on Hululu debuted under the franchise's [[Kemono Friends V Project|KemoV Project]] label as one of its founding members, alongside [[African Penguin (Kemono Friends)|African Penguin]]. This Humboldt Penguin is a soft-spoken and easygoing girl, generally preferring to hold chatting streams and play relaxed games such as [[Minecraft]].
