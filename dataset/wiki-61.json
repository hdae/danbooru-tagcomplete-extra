Since Japan stopped producing cylindrical postboxes in 1970 and has been replacing them with rectangular ones, the older cylindrical design has gained cultural and sentimental value, and a few are being preserved.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly shown design is the Postal submissions box No. 1 (round) 「郵便差出箱1号（丸型）」, dating from 1949. [Not to be confused with the 1970 submissions box No. 1 (rectangular) 「郵便差出箱1号（角型）」.]\r\nThe letter slot is cut into a circular panel on the upper section of the postbox, and is shielded by a curved eave. Collection times are posted on the collection plate, to one side of the circular panel. A square access hatch sits on the lower section of the postbox, below the letter slot. Unlike later, rectangular designs in which mail gets deposited directly into a mailbag that can be removed via a large door, the cylindrical design required loose mail items to be collected by hand through its relatively smaller hatch. This inefficiency led to it being phased out.\r\n\r\nThis tag is [b]not[/b] intended for all cylindrical postboxes. Some artistic liberty is allowed, such as variation in size and proportion, or missing/misplaced collection plate or access hatch, but the general design elements must be there. (e.g. post #1109518, despite the [[Japanese postal mark]] and small access hatch, more closely resembles a UK design in terms of shape and letter slot placement.)\r\n\r\nh4.

The Goonies II was released in North America, Europe, and Australia, although the original was one of the NES games released as part of the Nintendo VS. System arcade machine in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nThe Goonies II has little to do with the film. In it, the Fratellis have kidnapped all the Goonies (except [[mikey_(the_goonies)|Mikey]], whom the player guides) and have hidden them in cages across a terrain of caverns, mazes, and abandoned buildings. As Mikey, the player must rescue them all and ultimately free a mermaid named [[annie_(the_goonies)|Annie]]. Mikey was also a playable character in Konami's 1988 Famicom title Wai Wai World, which included a Goonies-themed level.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* \"Music Video\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxLhytQ67fs","is_locked":false,"other_names":["グーニーズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194563,"created_at":"2024-05-27T17:37:37.217-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:37:37.217-04:00","title":"onda_aka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["恩田赤"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":26117,"created_at":"2011-03-23T15:14:29.803-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:08:35.682-04:00","title":"leaning_back","body":"When a character who is either standing or sitting, leans backwards at the waist.

It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. \r\n\r\nCuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of 109,884 square kilometres (42,426 sq mi), and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. Its official language is [[spanish_text|Spanish]].\r\n\r\nUntil the 15th century, it was inhabited by Amerindian tribes which became a colony of [[Spain]] until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952.\r\n\r\nFurther unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established [[communism|communist]] rule under the leadership of [[Fidel Castro]].\r\n\r\nSince 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. A point of contention during the [[Cold War]] between the [[soviet|Soviet Union]] and the [[united states|United States]], a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Cuba is one of the few remaining Marxist–Leninist socialist states.\r\n\r\nCulturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\r\n\r\nh4.

As Reisen, she has [[swept bangs]] and a single bent ear, often [[breathing fire]] from a random one-shot joke in 2015. She is still active as a [[virtual youtuber]].\r\n\r\nShe was initially the least popular character of Cookie☆☆ S3, with almost no fan art or MADs. However in 2016, a single user by the name of [[Ants (cookie)|]] began posting MAD ranking videos as if she was a popular character like [[Majime-kun]]. Other users began ironically making MADs starring Hisui, which would then get added into Ants's rankings, which would then cause more people to watch them. This began the \"Unprecedented HSI姉貴 Boom\" where derivative characters with almost no connection to anything Hisui herself ever did were made. \r\n\r\nThis rapid escalation also caused a number of running jokes. One that carried over from Reisen is fake or detachable ears, except that Hisui's aren't and ends with her comedically spewing blood everywhere. Another is Reisen's affinity for guns, except Hisui prefers shotguns alongside [[Rurima (cookie)|]]. Her voice remixes include [[chirumiru]] and [[shin takarajima (song)|]].\r\n\r\nParody derivative characters include:\r\n* [[fake hisui (cookie)|Although-she-is-a-fake-but-she-looks-like-a-nice-person Hisui-san]]: an intentionally poorly drawn version that is animated extremely well as a joke\r\n* [[Metal Hisui (cookie)|]]: a robot version that can shoot lasers that turn anything to metal and fly.

He attracted a huge amount of fans and haters, as others were jealous of his rapid rise. This was compounded when he became a director of Cookie's most shitposty voice dramas, and people began accusing him of making his own MAD material. A rumor that he was a wanted [[karasawa_takahiro|HaseKara]] member began to spread, and on December 5th 2018 he was completely doxxed not by Cookie fans but by the HaseKara community.
