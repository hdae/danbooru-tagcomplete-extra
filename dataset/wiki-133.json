Enticed by the idea of being able to be someone else through a game avatar, Karen gets into Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Play Games (VRMMORPGs) wanting to be someone with a shorter stature.  She starts with ALfheim Online (ALO) using the name LLENN, but finds that the randomly assigned game avatar is too tall.  Advised by one of her friends, Karen transfers her account to various other games in the hopes of receiving a random avatar to her liking. She eventually settles on Gun Gale Online (GGO), as her randomly assigned avatar is a \"chibi\" with a height of 150 cm (~59 in).

It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]. The goal of the German offensive was to seize the harbor at Antwerp, an important Ally source of supplies, equipment and military support, so they could stop the eventual Allied advance into [[Germany]]. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern [[Belgium]] as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack and their fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. \r\n\r\nThe battle ended with an Allied [[victory]] and a significant [[defeat]] and depletion of the already exhausted German forces in fuel, armor and soldiers.
