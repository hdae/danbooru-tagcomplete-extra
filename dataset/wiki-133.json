His body double does not refer to moving so fast it looks to people as if there are several people present, but a secret technique where he is literally splitting himself apart and have his living body parts move in tandem. As a result of this, binding techniques and cutting attacks are mostly useless against him. Sandayu isn't actually human, but a rokurokubi or a type of ghost from another land known as a hitouban. He's the type of teacher who gladly teaches his techniques and knowledge to others. He often wanders from school to school wherever many problems arise and vacancies crop up. He likes students with strong competitive spirits that try to surpass their masters. And due to his experience from his home world, he has great sympathy for those who have lost their leaders.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[Tokyo Afterschool Summoners]]\r\n\r\nh4.

Herons vs. Cranes vs. Storks\r\n* Herons have relatively wide, heavy beaks for stabbing, grabbing and swallowing prey up to the size of rabbits. They fly with their necks bent in an \"S\" shape, retracted close to the body.  They are typically grey or multi-colored.\r\n* Cranes (see: [[red-crowned_crane]]) will have more delicate beaks, possibly rounder heads and straighter, more slender necks held straight when flying. If the bird has a white body, black neck and red forehead, it is a red-crowned crane.\r\n* Storks (see: [[oriental_stork]]) are extremely large, with even larger beaks than herons, and fly with their necks straight. They are frequently white with black flight feathers. Think of the stereotypical bird that carries babies in popular culture.\r\n\r\nh4.
