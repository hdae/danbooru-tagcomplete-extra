While slow start was simply intended to balance Regigigas, it worked too well, and it is frequently called one of the worst legendary pokemon as a result, being featured in many comics and images poking fun at it.\r\n\r\nIt comes to life only when [[Regirock]], [[Regice]], and [[Registeel]] are gathered. Therefore, it requires the three to be in the player's party to awaken it within the Snowpoint Temple \"[2]\":[#dtext-external-links], Twist Mountain \"[3]\":[#dtext-external-links], or Island Cave \"[4]\":[#dtext-external-links], where it sleeps. In the first two locations, it will still be present if those Pokémon are absent, but it does not awaken and only seems to be a statue to the player.\r\n\r\nJapanese Name: [[Regigigas]]\r\n\r\nPrior Pokémon: [[Heatran]]\r\nNext Pokémon: [[Giratina]]\r\n\r\nh4#external-links.

It was produced and distributed by Esperanto Films.\r\n\r\nPan's Labyrinth takes place in [[Spain]] in May–June 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative of the film interweaves this real world with a mythical world centered around an overgrown abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with which the main character, [[Ofelia]], interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist [[Captain Vidal]], hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, Animatronics and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures.\r\n\r\nDel Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film [i]The Devil's Backbone[/i] (2001), to which Pan's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's commentary on the DVD. The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English, German, and French titles refer specifically to the faun-like Greek character Pan. However, del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.\r\n\r\nThe film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2006. In the United States and Canada, the film was given a limited release on December 29, 2006, with a wide release on January 19, 2007. Pan's Labyrinth opened to widespread critical acclaim. The film won numerous international awards, including three Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards including Best Film Not in the English Language, the Ariel Award for Best Picture, the Saturn Awards for Best International Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Ivana Baquero and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["パンズ・ラビリンス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":143877,"created_at":"2022-05-17T00:11:05.859-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-17T00:36:08.186-04:00","title":"wolfteam","body":"A Japanese [[video game]] developer company.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":59513,"created_at":"2014-10-21T11:40:58.136-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-17T00:34:28.183-04:00","title":"churro","body":"A fried dough pastry snack served with [[chocolate]] or drizzled with it.\r\n\r\n(Probably) originated in [[Spain]].

(It is indeed quite a large weapon, especially for Reisen's small stature, who is almost dwarfed by it and she has to put the stock under her arm in order to use the scope. Though, she never seems to explicitly find it unwieldy or otherwise struggle with it.)\r\nIt doesn't use conventional bullets or any apparent projectiles and has no official explanation of how it works. Still, given its name and how it is seen operating, it is speculated it somehow manipulates spacetime to deliver its \"payload\" instantaneously to the target, [spoiler]to quote Reisen: \"You can't dodge a bullet that's already hit\" (bullet being likely metaphorical)[/spoiler].\r\nBecause of its unique appearance, ability, and infamy of its source material (and maybe a bit of \"rule of cool\"), it has become [i]somewhat[/i] popular in niche reference media.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]It was first seen when Reisen II engages [[Yakumo Yukari]] to assassinate her. Although the first shot doesn't impede or even phase her, its unique ability is first demonstrated and it seemed to have completely erased her midsection from existence without any apparent sign of it firing, thus even without its special ability, it is still extremely deadly. This seems to change Yukari's tactics as she forces Reisen into a close-quarter engagement to negate its range advantage.[/spoiler]\r\n[spoiler]Its second and final appearance is when Reisen II attempts to assassinate [[Hakurei Reimu]] next, who was in the middle of fighting [[Koakuma]]. Fortunately for her, this assassination is foiled by [[Reisen Udongein Inaba]]. Interestingly, Reimu appears shocked at the sight of the weapon and recognizes it by name, implying some further significance, which is unfortunately never explained.[/spoiler]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":143870,"created_at":"2022-05-16T19:21:42.488-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-16T19:21:42.488-04:00","title":"hollow_(bleach)","body":"In [[Bleach]], a dead human soul which has been corrupted into a monstrous form.

More specifically, it is the power that can only exist in the right hand of [[Kamijou Touma]] due to \"Imagine Breaker\" finding meaning in being inside Touma's right hand. Neither magic nor esper ability, nor Gemstone-derived, the Imagine Breaker has long been under intense speculation both in-universe and in the fandom, with only a few people in-universe such as Aleister Crowley knowing fully of what it entails.\r\n\r\nPrimary features\r\nAs shown throughout the series, Touma's Imagine Breaker negates both esper powers and magic. Moreover, in certain circumstances, it can negate even divine powers, such as the miracles of God (according to himself) and, more prominently, in his defeat of Archangel Gabriel in World War III.\r\n\r\nSupplementary features\r\nIn two different instances, Touma has demonstrated that he can dispel to an extent the effects of an area-wide attack. One instance is blocking the effects of electricity [[Misaka Mikoto]] created, by putting his right hand out to act as a lightning rod for the electricity, so it hits his right hand instead to any another part of his body. The other one is blocking a portion of Kaitabi Hatsuya's Graviton bomb from hitting the people behind him using Imagine Breaker as a shield. Nonetheless, it is required for him to have physical contact to initiate the effects of his power.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Imagine Breaker has a permanent canceling effect on some supernatural objects, as seen when it robbed Index's clothes of their Walking Church. Imagine Breaker can even ignore the actual weight or force of an object being propelled by supernatural power, as seen when Touma blocked a full-powered punch from a massive golem without showing signs of obvious effort, followed by the golem collapsing due to the magic that manifested it being abolished by Imagine Breaker. He did, however, \"almost break his hand\" in said exchange. Another example is when Touma blocked Acqua of the Back's magic-enhanced attack while in a weakened state, in contrast to how normal attacks (with no magic behind them) from Acqua could easily overpower him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

Lynn's shop was doing quite well until one customer's review bomb completely decimated her business overnight. That night, while on her way back home after drinking her sorrow away, she rescued a child almost getting run over by an automobile and got fatally injured. After miraculously waking up, she somehow gained insight into cooking and operating a shop, and decided to try again one last time.\r\n\r\nLynn's misfortune started way before her shop went bankrupt; she is truly the incarnation of bad luck. The restaurant run by her parents went bankrupt during the time of clashes between the Tiger clan and the Viper clan. Every other little diner Lynn started to work at went straight bankrupt. Eventually, she had no choice but to go learn how to cook from an old chef she met in the first diner she worked. Since everything goes south when she tries to do anything, she got into the habit of drinking tea and getting drunk every day to soothe the bitterness.\r\n\r\nShe loves every kind of tea, but her favorite is Shen City's most beloved grain tea. When she drinks tea she'll befriend anyone next to her, and get into a fight with the person next to them the following moment. She's lively and friendly when she's drunk, but always anxious when she's sober. The same thing goes for her combats; with her drinks, she gets more powerful, full of confidence, and without any hesitation.

During the 1950s Tomsin, the last white beer brewery in Hoegaarden, closed. The local milkman, Pierre Celis, had worked at the Tomsin brewery as a young man. In 1965, while in his forties, Celis decided to purchase some brewing equipment and start making white beer again. He recreated the recipe based on his experience working at the brewery and from locals who remembered the look and taste of the beer. His new brewery was called De Kluis, meaning “cloister,” in honor of the monks who brewed beer in the region during the Middle Ages. The beer was called Hoegaarden, after Celis’ hometown.\r\n\r\nSold in dozens of countries worldwide, Hoegaarden is widely considered the standard of the Belgian-white style of beer. It is made from malted barley, unmalted wheat, hops, coriander, and curaçao orange peel. It is very pale in color and hazy with a frothy head of foam. The aroma and taste are citrusy, fruity, spicy, and refreshing, with a light snappy bitterness. The beer is light-bodied, well balanced, and mild in strength and balanced with a deceptively mild amount of alcohol (4.9% ABV).\r\n\r\nHoegaarden quickly became successful in Belgium and elsewhere around the world. By 1985 the brewery was producing 75,000 hectoliters of beer per year, when disaster struck and the brewery burned to the ground. Unable to rebuild on his own, Celis turned to the Belgian brewing group Interbrew (now AB-InBev), who eventually ended up owning the brewery and brand.\r\n\r\nTypes of Hoegaarden beer.\r\n\r\nRosée.\r\nLaunched in 2007, 3% ABV.

He occasionally sports a [[turquoise scarf]] and is seen with circular, [[white bands]] looped around his calves. He also wears a distinct pair of [[hanafuda earrings]], with the image of the rising sun over a mountain.\r\n\r\nDuring the Final Selection, Tanjiro wears a blue, cloud-patterned samue-styled [[kimono]] and [[black pants]], nearly identical to Sakonji's outfit. He still wears his [[hanafuda earrings]], but his hair is cut extremely short and remains the same length since. Similar to the rest of the apprentices that were trained under Sakonji, Tanjiro wears a hand-carved [[fox mask]] crafted from his master on the left side of his head. The mask has red accents on the eyes, ears, and spots on each corner of its mouth. On the upper right corner of the mask, there is a sun-shaped design that likely symbolizes the scar on his forehead.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro wears the standard [[Demon Slayer uniform]], a dark-brown gakuran jacket, a white belt, baggy chocho zubon pants that extend into tabi socks, a pair of zōri with red straps, and bands of white cloth wrapped tightly around his calves resembling kyahan, all beneath his signature [[checkered haori]]. He carries a large [[wooden box]] on his back (which was a gift to him from [[Urokodaki Sakonji]]), where his sister sleeps as they travel during the day.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]After being turned into a [[demon]] by [[Kibutsuji Muzan]], Tanjiro is able to heal the growth on his face as well as regenerate his lost arm and other smaller injuries. He obtains eyes with [[slit pupils]], fangs and flame-shaped marks over his left forehead and right jaw that are reminiscent of those of [[Kokushibou]], in addition to a third, smaller flame-shaped mark coming down from the right side of his head down to his eyebrow after he conquered the weakness to sunlight. His scar turns into a flame-pattern as if it were a permanent Demon Slayer Mark, has become longer and is the largest of the three, and all three marks vaguely point towards his nose, though only his scar-mark reaches it. He still dons his bloodstained corps uniform, one sleeve ripped off where his arm was severed, but loses his checkered haori and the Nichirin Sword at his hip.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[spoiler]After returning to his human form, Tanjiro loses the ability to see from his right eye, the iris of which is now a dull pink-gray color and the pupil black rather than its original white. His left arm, which he regrew as a [[Demon]], now takes the appearance of that which an older person may have, becoming wrinkled and skeletal, and he loses all feeling in it below the elbow and thus the ability to move it from his forearm down.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nh4.
