Once behind his target, he uses his signature [[balisong]] or other [[knife|knives]] to instantly kill them with a [[backstab]].

He takes his job as an assassin very seriously, and although he can often be amicable and polite, he considers sociality secondary to cold efficiency. Lives in a camper [[van]], and has questionable hygienic practices. Although he cares for his adoptive parents, they are shown to disagree with his line of work.

Despite almost always being drunk on the job, he's professional and skilled, though often rowdy and belligerent to his foes. As a child, he lost his eye to an incident involving a wizard and a sentient grimoire of explosives, and in the game's current year he lives with, and dotes on, his blind, job-obsessed mother, where he's shown to be much more personable and friendly while off the clock. Has an on-off friendship with [[Soldier (tf2)|the Soldier]].\r\n\r\nIn-game, the Demoman has less movement speed and higher health than other classes, and specializes in long-range projectile explosives. His two main weapons are his [[grenade launcher]] and his \"stickybomb launcher\", which fires remotely-detonated bombs. He also wields his [[bottle]] of scrumpy as a melee weapon.

Dedicates himself to a bizarre, warped version of American history and excellence, to the point where his multinational teammates simply play along to avoid his ire. Despite being hilariously crazy, he remains an excellent combatant in the field of war.\r\n\r\nIn game, the Soldier has higher health and slower movement speed than most classes, offset by his ability to rocket jump.

Although he may seem like a slow, dim-witted gentle giant, in reality he is sharp-minded in his fluent tongue and generally wishes for people around him to stop talking. He becomes much more energetic when mowing down \"tiny baby men\", and delights in tearing apart enemies with his enormous miniguns.

It also features two sets of shoulder buttons, unlike the SNES controllers single set, and improved the ability to use those buttons by adding hand grips.\r\n\r\nStarting in 1997, the design incorporated a pair of analog sticks toward the center of the controller and vibration functionality, both of which have remained a common feature in later iterations of the design.\r\n\r\nh4.

The characters can fire guns and perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers to fight enemies across each stage. There are four weapons in the game which can be combined with one another to create different shot types.\r\n\r\nGunstar Heroes was a critical success, being praised for its frantic action and advanced graphics. It helped establish Treasure's place in the industry, and introduced several design conventions which would become characteristic of their later work such as large bosses and a unique sense of humor. \r\n\r\nIt was re-released several times, including dedicated ports to the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]], and received a sequel on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. \r\n\r\nSega released a \"Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box\" in 2006 in Japan, a compilation of Treasure games for the [[PlayStation 2]] as part of their Sega Ages 2500 series.
