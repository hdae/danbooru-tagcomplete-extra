Nowadays, he puts his experience to use teaching at the Reindeer faculty of the Santa School. Still new to teaching, he struggles a little with some aspects of the profession. Although he still secretly pines for his days on the battlefield, his injury ensures he will likely never pull a chariot again. He tries hard to maintain a calm and professional demeanor in front of his students, and has convinced himself that he behaves logically and rationally, but in truth, he has inherited much of his former master's bombast and bravado. His impulsive side comes through when he gets worked up, and he often ends up acting before he thinks. He has even been known to forget about his injury in the heat of the moment and try to break into a sprint, only to be painfully reminded of it moments later.

Her parents were highly sought-after business consultants and coaches for powerful CEOs around the world. Though her parents paid little attention to her (mostly leaving her in the care of the family’s omnic butler, [[bob (overwatch)|Bob]]), they ensured that Ashe had every opportunity to succeed. But a chance meeting with a local ruffian, named [[cassidy (overwatch)|Jesse McCree]], and an impromptu string of crimes committed together opened her eyes to her true calling. The satisfaction of outwitting her targets and the thrill of getting away with it set her on the outlaw path.\r\n\r\nAlong with the other three founders of the Deadlock Gang, Ashe started to make a name for herself with bigger and more extravagant heists. The Deadlock Gang’s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together.\r\n\r\nAshe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). Her principles: keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal.\r\n\r\nNo longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe is now writing her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that has put her at top of the authorities’ most-wanted lists and cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend.\r\n\r\nh4.

Among other things, the work contains an account of the [[elder_thing|Old Ones]], their history, and the means for summoning them. As such, it is considered a dangerous artifact that can be used as a gate to enable powerful beings from alternate lost dimensions of [[space]] to enter our world.\r\n\r\nOther authors such as August Derleth and Clark Ashton Smith also cited it in their works; Lovecraft approved, believing such common allusions built up \"a background of evil verisimilitude.\" Many readers have believed it to be a real work, with booksellers and librarians receiving many requests for it; pranksters have listed it in rare book catalogues, and even a student smuggled a card for it into the Yale University Library's card catalog.\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on the notoriety of the fictional volume, real-life publishers have printed many books entitled Necronomicon since Lovecraft's
