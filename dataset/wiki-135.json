Its task is to debug and maintain the virtual side of the city. Its secondary function is to seek out and disable illegal AR devices, software, and viruses, making it a menace to the characters of the series. Searchmaton can deploy up to four spherical drones to aid in its task. While Searchmaton can patrol the city streets freely, it is prohibited to enter private property such as houses, and other spaces such as temple grounds and schools, because they lie outside of the responsibility of Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration. The protagonists utilize this and other predictable aspects of Searchmaton's behavior to escape its grasp. Searchmaton, striking terror into the hearts of children, is ironically painted with a smiley face and punctuates its violent attacks with the cute catch phrase \"I'm Satchī!\" (僕サッチー boku Satchī?) which [[okonogi_yuuko|Yasako's]] father had a part in developing. [[harakawa_tamako|Tamako]] often hijacks Searchmatons for use as her personal digital henchmen. They are later replaced by the upgraded Searchmaton 2.0 in the form of cubes which have upgraded weapons and shielding, and can combine like the Q-chan to perform wide area re-formatting. Since the 2.0s are under government jurisdiction they can enter areas inaccessible to Satchī including shrines, and also private property when authorised.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)","is_locked":false,"other_names":["サッチー","サーチマトン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":118130,"created_at":"2020-11-07T16:42:20.650-05:00","updated_at":"2023-06-09T01:00:05.655-04:00","title":"mike_(drawingchisanne)","body":"[b][i]ミケ[/i][/b]\r\n\r\nA recurring character in [[chai (drawingchisanne)|]]'s artworks.

A clover clamp is not limited to clamping nipples, although this is the most commonly drawn use in art.\r\n\r\nNote: tag uses the singular \"clamp\" instead of plural form \"clamps\", since using a single clamp is seen frequently as well. Single clamps are typically for more extreme predicament and [[humiliation]] than for nipple play in [[BDSM]].\r\n\r\n(Full entry below includes text originally adapted from Wikipedia. Providing this note for reference to borrowed definition text from the article \"Nipple clamp, under the 'Clover clamp' section\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple_clamp#Clover_clamp])\r\n\r\nThe clover clamp, also referred to as \"butterfly clamp\" or \"bird clamp\" is of Japanese origin and was designed for clamping sails or sewing fabric. The clamp is flat, about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide, and has an eyelet to which a chain or cord can be attached. If this is pulled a mechanism inside the clamp moves the jaws closer together and provides increasing tension. When they are applied to the nipples a spring hinge holds them in place under tension and provides a very high pain level.They are used for [[nipple torture]] in the BDSM community.\r\n\r\nTo increase the tension on the nipples, small weights are sometimes attached to the clamps or the chain. These can be weights designed specifically for this purpose or weights such as fishing sinkers can be used.\r\n\r\nAnother use for the clamps is to keep a person in one place. If a cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move.\r\n\r\nThis technique can be used for [[predicament bondage]]. The removal of the clamps is also painful and different methods of removal can increase or decrease this pain.\r\n\r\nThese clamps have small points of contact and hence their pinch is usually painful, especially on people with larger nipples. They are usually only used by more experienced users for the purposes of [[edging]], [[orgasm denial]] or [[nipple torture]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["butterfly_clamp","Japanese_clamp","bird_clamp"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129999,"created_at":"2021-11-05T00:12:34.960-04:00","updated_at":"2023-06-05T07:33:19.496-04:00","title":"ishikawa_ken","body":"Ken Ishikawa (石川賢, Ishikawa Ken, June 28, 1948 – November 15, 2006) was a Japanese manga artist.

It is often accompanied by [[picnic|picnicking]], drinking, and other activities. \r\n\r\nThe appeal of viewing tree blossoms itself is found in the very brief period of flowering, which lasts seldom over a week before the petals have all fallen, and the leaves of their trees begin to sprout. This is considered a symbolic motif representing the beauty and impermanence of life. Owing to the cultural significance of the practice, Japan's national weather service keeps an annual forecast to inform the public as to when cherry trees are predicted to blossom. \r\n\r\nViewing plum blossoms (ume) is an older practice which started in the Nara period, and was eclipsed during the Heian period by the popularity of viewing cherry blossoms. Many older Japanese today prefer ume viewing (sometimes known as 梅見, [i]umemi[/i]), as they find that sakura viewing parties may be too crowded and raucous. \r\n\r\nh4.
