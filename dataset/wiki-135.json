The wrestler then does a spinning toe hold and grasps the other leg, crossing them into a \"4\" (hence the name) as he does so and falls to the mat, applying pressure to the opponent's crossed legs with his own. \r\n\r\nWhile the hold applies pressure to the knee, it actually can be very painful to the shin of the victim. While the move is primarily a submission move, if the opponent has his shoulders on the mat, the referee can make a three count for a pinfall. If the referee is distracted, heel wrestlers may grab onto the ropes while executing the move to gain leverage and inflict more pain. \r\n\r\nWith enough strength and willpower, the wrestler on defense can flip himself (and also their opponent) over onto their belly, which is said to reverse the pressure to the one who initially had the hold locked in.\r\n\r\nThis is innovated by \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers and popularized by Ric Flair.

At that time of the war, four [i]Kōkūtai[/i] (air groups) operated a total of 66 H6K4s.\r\n\r\nThe type had some success over South East Asia and the South West Pacific. H6Ks had excellent endurance, being able to undertake 24-hour patrols, and were often used for long-range reconnaissance and bombing missions. From bases in the Dutch East Indies, they were able to undertake missions over a large portion of Australia.\r\n\r\nHowever, the H6K became vulnerable to a newer generation of more heavily armed and faster fighters. It continued in service throughout the war, in areas where the risk of interception was low. In front-line service, it was replaced by the Kawanishi H8K.\r\n\r\nh4.

[i]The King of the Cave[/i], released as [i]Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo[/i] in English\r\n\r\nA 2004 animated adaptation/re-imagining of Alexandre Dumas's classic french novel, \"[i]The Count of Monte Cristo[/i]\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo, by GONZO. The setting is moved to the year 5053 (vs. 1815-1838 in the novel), though the majority of the story remains in France. The protagonist is [[Albert de Morcerf]] instead of Edmond Dantes. \r\n\r\nThe series is notable for its use of a \"collage\" effect where the hair and clothing of characters act as \"holes\" to stationary backgrounds underneath (the pattern stays still, but the opening changes as the characters move around) (see post #139047 for a good example of the effect on Haydee). The series also makes heavy use of CG art.\r\n\r\nA manga by Maeda Mahiro, director of the TV series, was also released, beginning in 2005 in Kodansha's [i]Afternoon[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.

It needs some space behind the opponent to be effective, and can be applied from the side control or guard. Contrary to the americana, the opponent's wrist is grabbed with the hand on the same side, and the opposite arm is put behind the opponent's arm, again grabbing the attacker's wrist and forming a figure-four. By controlling the opponent's body and cranking the arm away from the attacker, pressure is put on the shoulder joint, and depending on the angle, also the elbow joint (in some variations the opponent's arm is brought behind their back, resulting in a finishing position resembling that of the hammerlock).\r\n\r\nThe kimura was named after the judoka Kimura Masahiko, who used it to defeat one of the founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hélio Gracie.

When he works as part of the Invaders, he acts in operations devised by Inumura Daikaku Masanori and is specially charged with infiltrating other guilds and attacking their VIPs. He has a self-sacrificial personality who chooses to do the dirty work himself. Yoshito prefers masters who treat him not as a person with feelings, but as a tool. Here in Tokyo, Yoshito fights with a giant robot body his guildmaster has given him. This robot is able to install the past memories of others. If Yoshito were to use it in conjunction with his Sacred Artifact, he could conceivably copy and recreate the techniques of the other Hakkenshi. He has a very thin attachment to life and strongly believes himself to be replaceable. Yoshito apparently shows sympathy akin to pity when it comes to people who do not have a definite singular sense of self. In contrast, he tends to avoid those with high self-esteem and those who pride themselves as the one true ancestor or originator.\r\n\r\nh4.
