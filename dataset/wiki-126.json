The title translates literally as [i]Shit Soup Technique[/i].\r\n\r\nTwo gay men, the young [[Michishita Masaki]] who is sensitive to handsome men, and [[Abe Takakazu]], a car mechanic who's sitting on a park bench, engage in [[yaranaika|one of the most iconic encounters in eromanga history]] and end up having [[sex]] in a bathroom stall.\r\n\r\nDue to the memorable quotes and reaction faces, the manga later spawned the [[yaranaika|\"Yaranaika?\"]] [[meme]] in 2002. These memes and resulting interest in the manga itself would spark a boom in [[yaoi]] and [[yuri]] content that continues on to this day. It is often paired with [[Manatsu no yo no Inmu]] (Inmu-chu) and [[gachimuchi|Gachimuchi Pants Wrestling]] as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ), since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nFor April Fools 2023, an anime \"adaptation\" of the manga was announced, entitled Shin Yaranaika, to be produced by Anime Tokyo and Studio Leo, and directed by Itou Pierre, as a medium-length all-ages OVA. Later that month, more details on the project were revealed before a crowdfunding campaign was launched to aid in funding the project. The project would meet its crowdfunding goal in late May, and a release date for April Fools 2024 was announced later in October.\r\n\r\nh4.

The American [[82nd Airborne]] Division took part in the battle.\r\n\r\nThe Allies' primary goal was to capture the two bridges over the Waal River at Nijmegen – the road route over the Waalbrug (Waal Bridge) and Nijmegen railway bridge – and relieve the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade at [[Arnhem]], 10 miles (16 km) north of Nijmegen. The Allied infantry units at Arnhem were surrounded by the Germans, and involved in heavy fighting for control of bridges over the Rhine.\r\n\r\nDelays caused by hastily-organised German reinforcements at Nijmegen ultimately led to the failure of Operation Market Garden. It took the Allies longer than expected to secure a land route to Arnhem, where the British and Polish forces were forced south of the Rhine and sustained massive casualties.

A Ugoira is a Zip file of images, played back using a custom Javascript player.\r\n\r\nTo download a Ugoira, use the \"Save as video (right click and save)\" link beneath the image. This is a WebM conversion that can be played on regular video players, but is not lossless in quality.\r\n\r\nTo upload a Ugoira, paste the Pixiv URL into the source field on the upload page, or upload using the \"bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet]. Uploading a Ugoira file from your computer will not work.\r\n\r\nTechnically, a Ugoira consists of Zip file containing each frame in JPEG or PNG format, and a separate JSON file containing the delay between each frame. Since each frame has a separate delay, it's possible for a Ugoira to have a variable frame rate. A \"custom Javascript player\":[https://github.com/pixiv/zip_player] is used to play animations back. Since the JSON file containing the frame delays is separate from the Zip file containing the images, saving raw Ugoiras and playing them outside of a browser is difficult.\r\n\r\nUgoira is a custom format exclusive to Pixiv. Animations from other sites cannot be Ugoira.\r\n\r\nUgoira is often considered inferior to animations found on other sites due to Pixiv's limitations on uploading GIFs or MP4 videos. As a result, artists may convert their animations to GIFs before uploading, introducing [[gif artifacts|dithering]] and/or [[color banding]], and Pixiv's recompression process can introduce additional [[JPEG artifacts]], affecting the overall quality of Ugoira animations.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* topic #11108\r\n* topic #10712\r\n* [[emofuri]]\r\n* [[ugoira conversion]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["うごイラ","東方うごイラ","アニぱい","乳揺れ(うごイラ)","우고이라","動圖"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":99863,"created_at":"2018-08-01T21:01:51.307-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-27T12:21:30.275-04:00","title":"arms_under_breasts","body":"When both of a character's upper arms are underneath one or more of their breasts.\r\n\r\nOften seen with [[crossed arms]] or [[covering breasts]]\r\n\r\nWhen only one arm is under the breasts, see [[arm under breasts]].\r\n\r\nh4.

As an experiment, he granted his opponent some of Orochi's power to see if he could become a valid host for the entity. Goenitz eventually assigns the task of observing the crimelord to two other Hakkeshu, [[Mature (KOF)|]] and [[Vice (Kof)|]].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he paid a visit to a remote village where a Hakesshu member, Gaidel, was staying. To his surprise, Gaidel was living a peaceful life and had no interest in their lord's mission. In response, Goenitz activated the Riot of the Blood in [[Leona Heidern|Leona]], which lead to the death of her parents and everyone else in the village. Pleased with the results, he sealed away her memories and continued to look for ways of speeding up his lord's revival. He noticed that the seal containing Orochi is too strong for his lord, so he paid a visit to the Yata household. He murdered the current head of the clan, [[Kagura Maki]], to break the seal's power.\r\n\r\nSometime after the 1995 tournament, he also decided to track the Three Sacred Treasures that previously defeated his lord. Since he had previously judged [[Kagura Chizuru|Chizuru]] and Mature and Vice were keeping an eye on [[Yagami Iori|Iori]], Goenitz decided to personally test [[Kusanagi Kyou|Kyo's]] strength. Although he expected a glorious fight from the 1995 champion, he defeated the Kusanagi heir with ease. Later, he interrupts the 1996 tournament to finally end all three heirs at once.

It is a member of the family Sphenacodontidae. The most prominent feature of Dimetrodon is the large neural spine sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending from the vertebrae. It walked on four legs and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the Southwestern [[United States]], the majority coming from a geological deposit called the Red Beds of [[Texas]] and Oklahoma.

She was completed in 1915 and served with the Baltic Fleet during [[World War I]], though she saw only limited action. Her crew mutinied with the rest of the Baltic Fleet in the February Revolution of 1917.\r\n\r\nHer appearance is somewhat similar to Hibiki (they share the same artist). Gangut has [[long hair|long]] [[grey hair]] and [[red eyes|red]]/[[orange eyes]]. In her basic form she wears a [[white jacket]] with [[belt]] over a [[red shirt]], [[black skirt]] and [[black pantyhose]]. She also wears [[black gloves]], [[black footwear|black]] [[boots]] and a [[peaked cap]] with [b]a white crown and black visor[/b]. In her [[gangut dva (kancolle)|dva]] (Cyrillic: два, meaning \"two\") form, she wears her [[jacket on shoulders|jacket on her shoulders]], revealing her [[short sleeves|short-sleeved]] red shirt and an [b] all black peaked cap[/b].\r\n\r\nA noticeable trait shared with all her forms is a [[scar on cheek|scar under her left eye]] after being struck by a [[he 111|Heinkel He 111]] from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4).\r\n\r\nShe is voiced by Seto Asami [瀬戸 麻沙美].\r\n\r\nh4.

Whereas Tsuruya is easily excitable and laughs a lot, Churuya seems more simple-minded, and has a deep appreciation for [[smoked cheese]]. Her signature catchphrase is [[nyoro~n]].\r\n\r\nChuruya first appeared on Eretto's website in a now famous [[4koma]] (post #47838). Churuya inherited Eretto's love of smoked cheese. Notably, in the last panel Churuya utters her catchphrase [[nyoro~n]] when she becomes disappointed by the lack of smoked cheese. Likely one major reason for Churuya's popularity is the sense of schadenfreude at Churuya's perpetual misfortune.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start, fan reaction to Eretto's Churuya comics was wildly positive. After being linked on [[2channel]], Eretto's site would frequently go down because of all the traffic. Eretto continued to write new Churuya-san 4koma, and has even anthologized them in doujinshi.\r\n\r\n[[Churuya]] became a meme frequently used by other artists. Usually the one common factor is the last panel, where a character drawn in the style of Churuya (complete with [[:3]]) says [i]nyoro~n[/i] or some variation thereof.\r\n\r\nh4.

He looks like a stuffed doll that has an orange sphere, called \"Energy Bon Bon\", floating over his head, which attracted the interest of many 2ch users.\r\nOfficials from the game's publisher KOEI announced at the game press release conference that they were aiming for the sale of half a million to a million copies of the game. However, the initial sales figures were extremely low, and 2ch users believed that the producer / character designer Majima Shintarou and the developer ArtePiazza were responsible for this.\r\n\r\nYaruopoona is a [[fusion]] character that combines Opoona and another 2ch Ascii art character named [[Yaruo]]. The sphere over Yaruopoona's head differs from the original in that it is supported by a brace sticking out from the top of his head. He always has a grimace on his face but quite frequently tries to give you a purchase deed, while saying \"Good Job! As a reward, I will give you the right to buy Opoona!\" in an extremely condescending tone of voice. However, next to him used to stand a cart of new games on special bargain sale which was piled up to the top with Opoona games.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the game's slow sales was the fact that its launch date happened to coincide with the launch date of [[Super Mario Galaxy]]. However, afterward it became clear that the game was actually of decent quality, and the game title and the developers regained their good reputation. Even now, \"Yaruopoona\" and the phrase \"I will give you the right to buy...!\" are still extremely well-known.\r\n\r\nOpoona has been incorporated as one of [[Zack (DOA)|]]'s costumes in \"[[Dead or Alive]]: Dimensions.\" In this costume, Zack's win quote was \"I will give you the right to fight me!\"\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* 2ch all Ascii-Art illustrations: http://riceballman.fc2web.com/AA-Illust/Data/Opu-na.html","is_locked":false,"other_names":["オプーナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":48081,"created_at":"2013-08-13T16:06:07.880-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-20T12:53:23.136-04:00","title":"666_(marino)","body":"[[2channel]] artist.

Originated with [[Closers]], popularized with [[Girls' Frontline]]'s Korean fanbase.\r\n\r\nIn [[Girls' Frontline]]'s case, the word is typically used for hard-to-acquire dolls, either due to atrocious drop rates for farmable dolls or atrocious production rates otherwise. The doll historically associated with this phrase is [[Five-seveN (girls' frontline)|]], whose drop rates during KR Cube were particularly atrocious, resulting in the meme sprouting up. Players who managed to acquire her made it a bragging point, and \"teased\":[/posts/6793612] those who lacked her. [[P90 (girls' frontline)|]]'s production rate was similarly infamous, leading to similar. The word has since then also been used for other time-limited dolls, particularly those that end up being very important (or just generally rare) farming targets that are otherwise unacquirable or just hard-to-get like [[Python (girls' frontline)|]] or [[M870 (girls' frontline)|]].

The channel rebranded as a result, going from \"Kemomimi VR Channel\" to  \"Virtual Program Channel\" (バーチャル番組チャンネル; briefly バーチャル番組連盟 at first) as Nekomasu moved away from YouTube, opting for Twitter and Niconico, branding himself \"Virtual Nojaloli Kitsunemusume [i]Former[/i] YouTuber Ojisan\" and eschewing the VTuber handle altogether, not considering himself one at all.\r\n\r\nThe original channel would go dormant after August 2019, and a new successor channel, simply titled Kemomimi Oukoku, would emerge later in October, its host gradually becoming a new model, Nekomasu-chan. The original channel would end up losing its branding entirely by May 2020, just becoming \"_\" as it continued to lay dormant. It wouldn't be until January 3rd, 2021 that the channel was once more returned to Nekomasu, being renamed to \"Kemomimi Oukoku「Kitsune」\", with all the LiveCartoon era videos becoming unlisted.\r\n\r\nh4.
