This plus the black neck, white streak leading from the red crown partially down the neck, and white body make them easy to identify. This crane is one of the largest crane species.\r\n\r\nOverall, they are snow white with black secondary flight feathers (in flight, these are the row of largest feathers present on the \"lower arm\" of the wing). This can appear like a fluffy black tail when the birds are standing, but the real tail feathers as well as the primary flight feathers are actually white. The bill is olive green to greenish horn, the legs are slate to grayish black.\r\n\r\nMales are black on the cheeks, throat, and neck, while females are pearly gray in these spots. \r\n\r\nSome artistic renditions may show a black tail or black primary flight feathers if the artist did not reference a photo or accurate illustration of the bird in flight. Regardless, if the crane has a red forehead or a line delineating this marking, it is almost certainly a red-crowned crane.\r\n\r\nIn Taoism this crane is a symbol of longevity and immortality. It also symbolizes luck and fidelity.\r\n\r\nh4.

The project will begin production in late 2013 following the airing of [[Kill la Kill]], with a goal to release it for winter 2014. Whilst initially having the funds for a twenty minute episode, Trigger launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to extend its runtime by fifteen minutes. The Kickstarter was launched on July 9, 2013 and met its $150,000 goal within five hours. A stretch goal of $500,000 was added to produce a making of documentary and audio commentary for the Bluray release. The Kickstarter raised a total of $625,518. Ootsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full length film. A television series was eventually made for the series in Winter 2017, and was premiered on Netflix.\r\n\r\nh4.
