She was initially seen from behind on the cover of the 13-20 May 2021 issue of Weekly [[Famitsu]] magazine (post #4488154), but it was not until December 28, 2021 that she made her full reveal.\r\n\r\nLike Kasuga Maru, Yawata Maru notably is modeled upon \"classic Japanese falconry\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takagari]. She carries an [[aircraft]] (a \"Mitsubishi A5M\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A5M], immediate predecessor to the famous \"zero\" fighter) on her left forearm with [[jesses]] tied to her equipment.\r\n\r\nYawata Maru has [[long_hair|long]] dark [[brown hair]] tied into [[twin braids]] rolled into a [[double bun]] hairstyle and [[blunt bangs]].  She has [[brown_eyes|brown]] [[tareme]]-style eyes.  Similar to [[shibafu_(glock23)|Shibafu's]] [[akagi (kancolle)|fleet]] [[kaga (kancolle)|carriers]], Yawata Maru wears a white [[dougi]] top with a red [[hakama short skirt]], and [[black socks|black]] [[ankle socks]].  On her left hand, she wears a thick falconry [[gloves|glove]].\r\n\r\nHer [[machinery|rigging]] involves a [[flight deck]] strapped to her right arm, falconry-related steel pouches strapped to her torso, and steel [[platform boots]].\r\n\r\nHistorically, the [i]Yawata Maru[/i] was second of the three [i]Nitta Maru[/i] class passenger-cargo liners, but was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into a light aircraft carrier, similar to the fate of the [i][[hiyou (kancolle)|Hiyou]][/i] and [i][[jun'you (kancolle)|Jun'you]][/i].  Like Kasuga Maru before her, she resembles \"her earlier anthropomorphized self on an advertisement alongside her sister-ships back in the 1940's.\":[http://otakei.otakuma.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/210.jpg]  She was never completed as a passenger liner, however, and was requisitioned and converted into a carrier before ever performing any duties as a passenger liner.\r\n\r\nYawata Maru spent most of her service ferrying aircraft, cargo, and passengers to various bases in the Pacific. She was badly damaged by an American submarine in early 1944. After repairs were completed in June 1944, the ship resumed transporting aircraft and cargo. During a return voyage from Singapore in September 1944, she was sunk by the submarine USS [i]Barb[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.

Developed as a lighter, shorter range alternative to the [[panzerschreck]] that could be used by a single person rather than a two-man team, the panzerfaust weighed 6.5kg (14 lbs) and fired a High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) grenade. The effective range of the weapons were initially 30 meters (33 yards) and able to penetrate 200mm (7.9\") of armor. Late WWII models had a effective range of 150 meters (164 yds) and could penetrate 280mm (11\") or more of armor. They were often deployed to rifle squads or volksgrenadiers, giving a single squad unparalleled tank-killing ability. Several examples of the panzerfaust were captured by the Russians towards the end of World War Two, and the panzerfaust is often credited with having inspired their rocket-propelled grenade weapons. \r\n\r\nDespite being intended to replace the panzerschreck, itself a derivative of the American M1 Bazooka, it should be noted that the panzerfaust and its derivative, the RPG-2, were not rocket launchers, as the projectiles they fired did not use rocket motors and the charge that was detonated to launch the grenade burned entirely within the tube at launch.  The weapon was based on those of a recoilless gun.\r\n\r\nh4.

The \"[i]Chi[/i]\" comes from \"[i]chuu-sensha[/i],\" meaning \"medium tank,\" and the \"[i]Ha[/i]\" is derived from the third syllable of \"[i]iroha[/i],\" a Japanese poem form. Together this gives Chi-Ha the meaning of \"third developed medium tank.\" \r\n\r\nProduced by Mitsubishi, it was armed with a 57mm cannon in an offset turret. Its armour-penetrating capabilities were low, and the tank had extremely weak armor that could be penetrated by small arms fire at close range.\r\n\r\nLater on, the primary armament was upgraded to a 47 mm tank gun with improved armour-piercing capabilities. This improved version is often referred to by such names as the \"Chi-Ha with Advanced Gun Turret,\" \"Chi-Ha 'Kai' (Revised),\" or \"Type 97 Kai.\" However, these nicknames did not come into use until after the war.\r\n\r\nThe original Chi-Ha was equipped with a short, cylindrical gun turret and a characteristic radio [[antennae|antenna]] popularly known as a \"[i][[hachimaki]][/i] antenna,\" while the gun turret on the Chi-Ha Kai had an angular shape.\r\n\r\nOne of the few strong points of this tank was its versatility, as a number of military machines were developed using the Chi-Ha's framework, such as the 75mm [[Type 3 Chi-Nu]] medium tank, and various self-propelled artillery, tank destroyers, and amphibious tanks (though only a very small number were produced and utilized).\r\n\r\nh4.

The tank's chassis shape, undergoing repeated modifications, can broadly be divided into 4 different types. The majority types were equipped with an unditching tail (In actuality it was mostly used as a storing shelf.) \r\n\r\nAlthough the I-gou was a successful vehicle, its low horsepower and mobility prompted the development of the [[Type 95 Ha-Gou]].

As the main gun and armoring have been upgraded in the style of the [[Leopard 2]]A6, the suspension has also been modified to support the extra weight. Its fighting capability in the story is also roughly the same as the Leopard 2A6. (Apparently, at the time that the first game of the series was released in 1996, the fighting capability of the actual [[Type 90 Kyu-Maru]] was not accurately known.)\r\n\r\nThe opening intro movie of this game starts from a battle, set in 2015, between APC (Asia Pacific Corps) and PEU (Pan European Union) at Kharkiv. (The English version has a different setting.)\r\nThe two tank platoons of the APC Type 90 Kai get overwhelmingly destroyed by PEU's Leopard 3 tanks.
