It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]. The goal of the German offensive was to seize the harbor at Antwerp, an important Ally source of supplies, equipment and military support, so they could stop the eventual Allied advance into [[Germany]]. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern [[Belgium]] as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack and their fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. \r\n\r\nThe battle ended with an Allied [[victory]] and a significant [[defeat]] and depletion of the already exhausted German forces in fuel, armor and soldiers.

Multiple government agencies from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] were involved in the massive search spanning four days and  over 25000 square kilometers.

All 5 people onboard, including OceanGate's CEO have been declared dead. Subsequent investigations revealed the vessel was practically doomed from the start, due to poor design and ignorance by the company's CEO, including him firing an expert for telling him his vessel was not seaworthy and previously saying things that essentially amounted to \"screw safety.\"\r\n\r\nh4.
