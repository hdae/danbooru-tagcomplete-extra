[b]Leyte Open Sea Naval Battle[/b]) was the [b]largest naval battle of [[World War II]][/b] and by some criteria [b]the largest naval battle in history[/b], with over 200,000 naval personnel involved. It was fought in waters near the [[Philippines]] islands of Leyte, Samar, and Luzon from 23 to 26 October 1944 between combined [[united_states|American]] and [[Australia]]n forces and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), as part of the [b]Allied invasion of Leyte[/b], which aimed to isolate Japan from the colonies that it had occupied in Southeast Asia, a vital source of industrial and oil supplies.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the battle, [[Japan]] had much fewer capital ships ([[aircraft carrier]]s and [[battleship]]s) left than the Allied forces had total aircraft carriers in the Pacific, which underscored the disparity in force strength at that point in the war. Regardless, the IJN mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion, but it was repulsed by the US Navy's Third and Seventh Fleets.\r\n\r\nThe battle consisted of four main separate engagements (the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Cape Engaño, and the Battle off Samar), as well as lesser actions. Allied forces announced the end of organized Japanese resistance on the island at the end of December.\r\n\r\nIt was also the [b]first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized [[kamikaze pilot]] attacks[/b] (which were deadly effective and sunk many Allied ships), and it was the [b]last naval battle between battleships in history[/b]. The battle ended in a decisive [[victory]] for the Allies. The Japanese Navy suffered heavy losses and never sailed in comparable force thereafter since it was stranded for lack of fuel in its bases for the rest of the war.\r\n\r\nh4.

Appearance\r\nShe has [[long_hair|long]] [[black hair]] with [[tress_ribbon|red tress ribbons]] and [[red eyes]]. Some art makes light on how she essentially looks like a black-haired [[murakumo (kancolle)|Murakumo]] and a pixiv tag is dedicated to how she looks like a tiny [[nagato (kancolle)|Nagato]].\r\n\r\nShe wears a [[long_sleeves|long-sleeved]] white and blue [[serafuku]] with a yellow scarf on top of the standard Kagerou-class [[pleated skirt]], [[white gloves]] & [[uneven legwear|socks of different lengths]]. She [[dual_wielding|dual wields]] two pistols, one based from a standard 12.7cm twin gun and another is a collection of AA guns. On her back is her rigging. Unlike her sisters, it was made into a style similar to some larger ships' split bow. On her right is the part corresponding to her sisters' rigging with an additional 12.7 gun and a quadruple torpedo launcher attached to it and to her left is a depth charge launcher with another torpedo launcher attached to it.\r\n\r\nIn her remodel, her scarf has been changed to a rope, her thighhigh gains a stripe, the Standard 12.7cm guns have been replaced by their High-Angle equivalent, a radar has been propped behind her head and finally, camo-textures are added to her uniform.\r\n\r\nFor her B remodel (which is [i]not[/i] an actual second remodel), she is essentially the same as in her remodel except for her use of long 10cm guns. While she is now significantly more powerful stats-wise, the portrait serves as an art refresher.\r\n\r\nh4. Personality\r\nLike Nagato, she has a straightforward and professional personality with great pride in her fighting abilities. Perhaps because of this, she prefers a frontal and aggressive approach in battle rather than to engage in defensive measures.\r\n\r\nIt is implied in her hourlies that she is the only one in her division with poor culinary skills. At 0700, she said that [[hamakaze (kancolle)|Hamakaze]] told her how to make breakfast for the admiral but it ended in failure. At 1200, Tanikaze made the rice balls they ate at that time. At 1800, she ends up cooking with Urakaze. At 2000, it is revealed Urakaze made custard while Isokaze made grilled fish. The next hourlie implies that Urakaze's dish was better than Isokaze's. This has been exaggerated to the point that, if she and [[hiei (kancolle)|Hiei]] are allowed to cook together, they will produce something that is multiplicatively worse than if the two are allowed to cook separately.\r\n\r\nDue to her blunt personality, Isokaze is often depicted by fans as either being oblivious to her poor performance or simply being a narcisstic. Because of this, she is frequently depicted in ecchi/NSFW works as being more seasoned in sexual matters or simply viewing it as another form of competition. Alternatively, others have also depicted her in the more ladylike demeanour.\r\n\r\nShe is voiced by [[Kawasumi Ayako]], who also voices [[ooyodo (kancolle)|Ooyodo]], [[unryuu (kancolle)|Unryuu]], [[kamikaze (kancolle)|Kamikaze]] and the [[Midway Princess]]. Isokaze, in particular, shares a voice identical to [[Saber (fate)|]], who incidentally has much in common with her.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n* [[Isokaze (Azur Lane)]]\r\n\r\nh5.

Their secondary armament consisted of four 155-millimetre (6.1 in) triple-gun turrets formerly used by the Mogami-class cruisers. They were equipped with six or seven armed floatplanes to conduct reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nCommissioned in mid-1942, Musashi was modified to serve as the flagship of the Kidou Butai (Combined Fleet) during [[World War II]], and spent the rest of the year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk, Japan's main wartime naval base in the South Pacific theatre, in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. \r\n\r\nShe was present during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. During the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944. Over half of her crew was rescued. \r\n\r\nHer wreck was located in March 2015 by a team of researchers employed by [[Microsoft]] co-founder Paul Allen.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["戦艦武蔵","武蔵"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":178594,"created_at":"2023-12-04T02:30:11.947-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-04T02:30:11.947-05:00","title":"ruda_(puyopuyo)","body":"[i]A girl born in a snowy country known for it's intense cold.

On March 9th, Germany established its defence plan for the city with Operation Clausewitz. The first defensive preparations at the outskirts of Berlin were made on March 20th, under the newly appointed commander of Army Group Vistula, \"General Gotthard Heinrici\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Heinrici .\r\n\r\nWhen the Soviet offensive resumed on April 16th, two Soviet fronts (army groups) attacked Berlin from the east and south, while a third overran German forces positioned north of Berlin. Before the main battle in Berlin commenced, the Red Army encircled the city after successful (but very costly) battles of the Seelow Heights and Halbe. \r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 1945, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday, the 1st Belorussian Front led by \"Marshal Georgy Zhukov\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Zhukov , advancing from the east and north, started shelling Berlin's city centre, while Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front broke through Army Group Centre and advanced towards the southern suburbs of Berlin. On April 23th General Helmuth Weidling assumed command of the forces within Berlin. The garrison consisted of several depleted and disorganised Army and Waffen-SS divisions, along with poorly trained Volkssturm and Hitler Youth members. Over the course of the next week, the Red Army gradually took the entire city.\r\n\r\nOn April 30th, Hitler and several of his officials committed suicide. The city of [[Berlin]]'s garrison surrendered on May 2nd but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city until the end of the war in Europe on May 8th (May 9th in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies rather than to the Soviets.\r\n\r\nh4.

Its long designation was \"Type 0 Carrier Fighter\" (零式艦上戦闘機), and it was commonly called \"Reisen\" (零戦, zero fighter) by its pilots. This nickname was also popular among the Allies, more so than the official reporting name \"Zeke\". The plane was designed by [[Horikoshi Jirou]]. \r\n\r\nWhen the [b]ZERO[/b] was first introduced in 1940 it was considered the most capable carrier-based fighter, combining excellent maneuverability with a good climb rate and a very long operational range. These qualities combined with the excellent training of IJN pilots allowed the Japanese to win numerous early victories over their Allied adversaries. Because of its attributes the Zero was instrumental in the success of the attack at [[Pearl Harbor]].\r\n\r\nHowever, after the Americans introduced the [[F6F Hellcat]] and [[F4U Corsair]] in 1942, both of which are much faster, have longer operational range, and are more resilient and have better armor than the Zero, it began to struggle to compete against both planes, particularly due to its weak airframe and being particularily vulnerable to boom-and-zoom tactics. In the later half of the war, with [[battle_of_midway|the loss of experienced IJN pilots]], the Zero were mostly assigned as suicidal [i][[kamikaze pilot|kamikaze]][/i] aircraft in a desperate attempt to defend the country of [[Japan]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Initially, it dealt with personal computer products, but later expanded to the development and publishing of video games, mobile content, video game peripherals and music recording. \r\n\r\nPrimarily a video game publisher, it internally developed many of the video games it released while outsourcing others to external companies. It is known for series such as [[Bomberman]], [[Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima|Adventure Island]], [[Star Soldier]], and [[PC-Genjin|Bonk]]. Hudson also developed video games released by other publishers such as the Mario Party series from Nintendo.\r\n\r\nHudson Soft made the [[PC Engine]]/TurboGrafx-16 in association with [[NEC Corporation]], to compete against [[Nintendo]], [[SEGA]], and [[SNK]], while continuing making games on other platforms as a third-party developer.\r\n\r\nThe mascot of the company is a [[bee]] named [[Hachisuke]]. Hudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012, and merged with [[Konami]] Digital Entertainment, which was the surviving entity. Konami owns the assets of Hudson and has since rereleased its video game back catalogue on different occasions.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ハドソン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":151023,"created_at":"2022-09-25T14:50:19.769-04:00","updated_at":"2023-11-27T21:32:11.718-05:00","title":"nec_corporation","body":"[b]NEC Corporation[/b] (日本電気株式会社, [i]Nippon Denki Kabushiki-gaisha[/i]) is a [[Japan]]ese multinational information technology and electronics corporation, headquartered in Minato, [[Tokyo (city)|]]. \r\n\r\nThe company was known as the [b]Nippon Electric Company, Limited[/b], before rebranding in 1983 as [b]NEC[/b]. It provides IT and network solutions, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of things (IoT) platform, and telecommunications equipment and software, to business enterprises, communications services providers and to government agencies, and has also been the biggest Personal [[Computer]] vendor in Japan since the 1980s, when it launched the PC-8000 series.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, NEC licensed technology from [[Hudson]] Soft, a video game manufacturer, to create a video [[game console]] called the [[PC Engine]] (later released in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 in the North American market). While the PC Engine achieved a considerable following, it has been said that NEC held a much stronger influence on the video game industry through its role as a leading semiconductor manufacturer than through any of its direct [[video game]] products.\r\n\r\nNEC was the world's fourth-largest PC manufacturer by 1990. Its semiconductors business unit was the world's largest semiconductor company by annual revenue from 1985 to 1992, the second largest in 1995, one of the top three in 2000, and one of the top 10 in 2006. NEC spun off its semiconductor business to Renesas Electronics and Elpida Memory. Once Japan's major electronics company, NEC has largely withdrawn from manufacturing since the beginning of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nNEC was #463 on the 2017 Fortune 500 list.
