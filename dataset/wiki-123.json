Snake Eater was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and published by [[Konami]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], and was released on November 17, 2004 in North America; December 16, 2004 in Japan; March 4, 2005 in Europe; and on March 17, 2005 in Australia. \r\n\r\nThe game, which serves as a prequel to the entire [[Metal Gear (series)|]] series, was followed by two direct sequels titled [[Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops]] and [[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]].\r\n\r\nSet in the Cold War era [[Soviet]] Union, the story centers on FOX operative Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a weapons designer and sabotage an experimental superweapon. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 60s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor.

They're the Blue Mermaids!\r\n\r\nBecause of a shift in tectonic plates around 100 years ago, Japan lost much of its area to submergence. To preserve Japan's territories, coastal cities sprung up, one after the other. Eventually, they became marine cities, and along with the expansion of sea-lanes to connect them, the need arose for a sizable staff to protect the seas.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, maritime jobs were becoming more popular among women. Hence, the Blue Mermaids, tasked with keeping the seas safe, had become every female student's dream job. This is when childhood friends Akeno Misaki and Moeka China enroll in a marine high school in Yokosuka, along with other girls who share their goal of becoming a Blue Mermaid.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4.

The physical component for [[Alice Margatroid]]'s spellcard \"Eerily Luminous Shanghai Doll\" in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] / [[Immaterial and Missing Power]], as well as her familiar in [[Imperishable Night]].\r\n\r\nShanghai is a very popular supporting character (or artifact) in [[Touhou]] fan art depicting Alice.\r\n\r\nSome comic artists give the [[doll]] a personality and feelings of its own, making it a \"master doll\" that helps control the lesser dolls. Others show it as Alice's primary magically-controlled \"puppet\". These points of view can be mixed, possibly to give an impression of Alice \"debating with herself\" through doll use, reminiscent of the way ventriloquists use puppets. Sometimes she/it is even depicted as lacking \"doll\" traits entirely, resembling a [[minigirl]].\r\n\r\nAnother view is that Shanghai is a type or class of magical dolls rather than an individual doll. This is based on the fact that several Shanghai dolls are seen simultaneously in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]].\r\n\r\nCanonically, Shanghai, like all the rest of Alice's dolls, is a mindless drone that requires direct supervision for all but the most basic of autonomous action, despite Alice's ongoing efforts to create a truly sapient construct. When a fanwork depicts Alice finally succeeding, Shanghai is usually the subject.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[matching Shanghai]]\r\n* [[Hourai Doll]]\r\n* [[Goliath Doll]]\r\n\r\nh4.
