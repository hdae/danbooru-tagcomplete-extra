It also features an optional FM synth soundtrack as downloadable content. It was localized overseas under the name [i]Gotta Protectors[/i] in 2016.\r\n\r\nIn celebration of the game's 3rd anniversary in Japan, Ancient released a freeware mini-game in 2017, [i]Minna de Mamotte Knight: Amazon no Diet Daisakusen[/i] (also known as [i]Gotta Protectors: Amazon's Running Diet[/i] in English) that can be played on  Nintendo Entertainment System emulators.

Its forearm blade is now gone, this prevents Garo from making slash attacks upon targets, but the forearm is thicker, with a reinforced end near the elbow, giving Garo harder physical back strikes and blocking. The overall new coverage makes Garo less susceptible to damage and fatigue for its user.
