The rear starboard-side mobile battery warship is BASTER-R and the rear port side mobile battery warship is BASTER-L. These design mechanisms were aimed at simplifying the transformation. Since each unit carries its own reaction engine and fold engine they can be deployed as independent warships or a fleet. \r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter has the capabilities of an aircraft carrier/amphibious assault spaceship, close-quarter combat capabilities through transformation to storm attack mode and can carry a maximum of 80 variable fighters and Destroids. \r\n\r\nThe Gatling-type buster cannon -which can be used as a Heavy Quantum Reaction gun- is suitable for heavy anti-ship combat.

Usually all rust code is considered safe. But if you put any code inside an unsafe block ([code]unsafe { some code here }[/code]) many of the strict rules of rust are ignored, which makes this code be considered unsafe. Unsafe code is necessary when doing things that safe rust do not support (like calling code from other programming languages).\r\nSome argue that this makes fatal errors easier to find (compared to other languages) since they are almost always found inside unsafe code.\r\n\r\nh4.
