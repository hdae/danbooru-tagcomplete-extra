Its principal task during its early years as a government-owned corporation was to repair and aid in the recovery of rail lines in the American Northeast and lower Great Lakes, neglected after their previous owners suffered decreasing revenue between stifling regulation and intensive competition from trucks and aircraft. Much of its early years would be spent shedding unprofitable branch lines and carrying out desperately-needed repairs on major rail arteries. The company would eventually turn a profit in the 1980s and be privatized shortly thereafter. Conrail as an independent entity would last until 1999, when it was split between the CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern. The company exists to the present day, albeit as a \"shared assets organization\" managed jointly by CSX and NS to handle freight traffic in and around the ports in the New York City area. \r\n\r\nThe company is remembered by American railfans for its particular origins, unique power (being the only railroad to order the EMD SD80MAC and having briefly run electrified operations in its early years), blue livery, and \"can opener\" logo.\r\n\r\nh4.

In Gongshou Li, the fingers cup the fist, and in Baoquan Li, the fingers are held straight out.\r\n\r\nGongshou Li (拱手礼), also know as [i]Fist and palm salute[/i], is a formal greeting etiquette in ancient China. It is commonly used in daily occasions (meeting and parting, when offering thanks or apologies). This greeting consists of a half-fist held in the palm of the other hand at stomach level, while [[bowing]] slightly to deeply depending on how much respect they want to convey.\r\n\r\nNote that for males, the right-hand makes the fist and the left hand is on top. For females, it's the opposite. At a funeral, the greeting is done on the other way around: right-hand on top for men and left-hand on top for women.\r\n\r\nBaoquan Li (抱拳礼) also know as [i]Kung Fu Salute[/i], [i]Hold palm salute[/i] or [i]Hold fist salute[/i], is a common etiquette derived from (but not exclusive to) Chinese martial arts. It shows the humility and often widely used among the kung fu masters and students. This salute is generally characterized by an open left hand placed next to a closed right fist. The importance is that the fingers on the left hand should stay extended and not flexed to cover the right fist.\r\n\r\nh4.

Like his father and grandfather before him, the Engineer specializes in inventing and constructing machines and devices, from the mundane to the scientifically fantastical.

Odd friends with [[Pyro (tf2)|the Pyro]], and the mortal enemy of [[Spy (tf2)|the Spy]].\r\n\r\nThe Engineer supports his team by constructing three buildings: the [[sentry]] gun that automatically fires on enemies, the [[dispenser (tf2)|]] that provides health and ammunition to his allies, and the [[teleporter]] which lets them quickly travel. His [[wrench]] is used as both a melee weapon and as a means to upgrade his buildings, and he carries a [[shotgun]] and [[handgun]] for personal defense, as well as various alternatives for each. One notable alternative is the Gunslinger, a [[single_mechanical_hand|mechanical hand]] that allows him to build \"mini\" sentry guns.\r\n\r\nThe Engineer's default outfit includes a yellow [[hard hat]], black [[goggles]], black [[overalls]] over a team-colored shirt, a thick [[belt]] with several pouches, yellow [[knee pads]], and black [[boots]]. He also wears one yellow rubber [[gloves|glove]] that hides the Gunslinger, and often carries his buildings in a team-colored [[toolbox]] when on the field.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エンジニア","エンジニア(TF2)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":39951,"created_at":"2012-11-08T05:11:49.728-05:00","updated_at":"2024-08-20T04:25:38.782-04:00","title":"sapper","body":"[i]Spy sappin' mah dispenser/sentry/teleporter.[/i]\r\n-- [[Engineer (tf2)|]]\r\n\r\n[[Spy (tf2)|]]'s default building weapon in [[Team Fortress 2]].

Its resemblance to the word \"emoticon\" is purely coincidental.\r\n\r\nEmoji as we know them originated as a proprietary system by a Japanese mobile phone operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] using a Unicode private-use block to encode their emoticons. While other mobile providers used many other systems for emoji, this system was the most compact implementation used at the time (and the closest to the current one).\r\n\r\nThe very first Emoji were actually Unicode Dingbats, of which, quite a few are now official Emoji. Emoji became a standardized system with its implementation in Unicode 6.0 in 2010 but it's only around 2014-2015 that their use exploded and became commonplace to the point that they became a cultural phenomenon with real world merchandise and even a movie about them.\r\n\r\nh4.
