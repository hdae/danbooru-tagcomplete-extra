He posted and wrote mostly on 4chan's jp board within the Monster Girl General threads (MGG/MGT), and his name and many of his characters remain recognizable there. While his work was inspired by MGE, his writing eventually outgrew it. \r\n\r\nBobanon's content was most notable for containing darker content and deeper character development than other MGE works, and for being much longer. While pornographic content was almost always contained in his stories, it wasn't always the focus. \r\n\r\nBob's most well known stories or series include Laska and Me, the \"Truckercore\" CYOA, The Submissive Manticore, and The Knotty Hellhound. His most well known character is probably Laska, a young orphan girl with many scars based on MGE's Cheshire Cat.

His middle set of eyes features the kanji of \"Upper Rank\" and \"One \". Kokushibo also has red markings resembling flames on the top left side of his forehead and the bottom right of his chin.
