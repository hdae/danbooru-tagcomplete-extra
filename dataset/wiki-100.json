To his surprise, Gaidel was living a peaceful life and had no interest in their lord's mission. In response, Goenitz activated the Riot of the Blood in [[Leona Heidern|Leona]], which lead to the death of her parents and everyone else in the village. Pleased with the results, he sealed away her memories and continued to look for ways of speeding up his lord's revival. He noticed that the seal containing Orochi is too strong for his lord, so he paid a visit to the Yata household. He murdered the current head of the clan, [[Kagura Maki]], to break the seal's power.\r\n\r\nSometime after the 1995 tournament, he also decided to track the Three Sacred Treasures that previously defeated his lord. Since he had previously judged [[Kagura Chizuru|Chizuru]] and Mature and Vice were keeping an eye on [[Yagami Iori|Iori]], Goenitz decided to personally test [[Kusanagi Kyou|Kyo's]] strength. Although he expected a glorious fight from the 1995 champion, he defeated the Kusanagi heir with ease. Later, he interrupts the 1996 tournament to finally end all three heirs at once. In the final events of the tournament He is defeated by Kyo with the help of, Iori, and Chizuru, humiliated Goenitz commits suicide in the aftermath of the tournament, making Kyo the champion of the tournament.\r\n\r\nh4.

Whereas Tsuruya is easily excitable and laughs a lot, Churuya seems more simple-minded, and has a deep appreciation for [[smoked cheese]]. Her signature catchphrase is [[nyoro~n]].\r\n\r\nChuruya first appeared on Eretto's website in a now famous [[4koma]] (post #47838). Churuya inherited Eretto's love of smoked cheese. Notably, in the last panel Churuya utters her catchphrase [[nyoro~n]] when she becomes disappointed by the lack of smoked cheese. Likely one major reason for Churuya's popularity is the sense of schadenfreude at Churuya's perpetual misfortune.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start, fan reaction to Eretto's Churuya comics was wildly positive. After being linked on [[2channel]], Eretto's site would frequently go down because of all the traffic. Eretto continued to write new Churuya-san 4koma, and has even anthologized them in doujinshi.\r\n\r\n[[Churuya]] became a meme frequently used by other artists. Usually the one common factor is the last panel, where a character drawn in the style of Churuya (complete with [[:3]]) says [i]nyoro~n[/i] or some variation thereof.\r\n\r\nh4.

He looks like a stuffed doll that has an orange sphere, called \"Energy Bon Bon\", floating over his head, which attracted the interest of many 2ch users.\r\nOfficials from the game's publisher KOEI announced at the game press release conference that they were aiming for the sale of half a million to a million copies of the game. However, the initial sales figures were extremely low, and 2ch users believed that the producer / character designer Majima Shintarou and the developer ArtePiazza were responsible for this.\r\n\r\nYaruopoona is a [[fusion]] character that combines Opoona and another 2ch Ascii art character named [[Yaruo]]. The sphere over Yaruopoona's head differs from the original in that it is supported by a brace sticking out from the top of his head. He always has a grimace on his face but quite frequently tries to give you a purchase deed, while saying \"Good Job! As a reward, I will give you the right to buy Opoona!\" in an extremely condescending tone of voice. However, next to him used to stand a cart of new games on special bargain sale which was piled up to the top with Opoona games.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the game's slow sales was the fact that its launch date happened to coincide with the launch date of [[Super Mario Galaxy]]. However, afterward it became clear that the game was actually of decent quality, and the game title and the developers regained their good reputation. Even now, \"Yaruopoona\" and the phrase \"I will give you the right to buy...!\" are still extremely well-known.\r\n\r\nOpoona has been incorporated as one of [[Zack (DOA)|]]'s costumes in \"[[Dead or Alive]]: Dimensions.\" In this costume, Zack's win quote was \"I will give you the right to fight me!\"\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* 2ch all Ascii-Art illustrations: http://riceballman.fc2web.com/AA-Illust/Data/Opu-na.html","is_locked":false,"other_names":["オプーナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":48081,"created_at":"2013-08-13T16:06:07.880-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-20T12:53:23.136-04:00","title":"666_(marino)","body":"[[2channel]] artist.

Originated with [[Closers]], popularized with [[Girls' Frontline]]'s Korean fanbase.\r\n\r\nIn [[Girls' Frontline]]'s case, the word is typically used for hard-to-acquire dolls, either due to atrocious drop rates for farmable dolls or atrocious production rates otherwise.

On the upload page, either paste the link to the image, or click the upload box to upload a file from your computer.\r\n\r\nThe link doesn't have to be a direct image link. For most sites, you should paste a link to the page containing the image, rather than the image itself. For example, for Twitter and Pixiv you can paste a link to the tweet or Pixiv post, rather than a link to the image itself.\r\n\r\nWhen uploading files from your computer, it's possible to upload multiple files at once by selecting them all in the file picker window. It's also possible to upload ZIP or RAR files.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What are the upload rules?]\r\n\r\nDon't upload content that is poor quality, [[off-topic]], a [[paid reward]], or [[AI-generated]]. Refer to the [[help:upload rules|upload rules]] for more details.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I make uploading easier?]\r\n\r\nThere are a few tools that make uploading much faster and easier:\r\n\r\n* Use the \"bookmarklet\":/static/bookmarklet or the \"Upload to Danbooru\":https://github.com/danbooru/upload-to-danbooru#install browser extension to upload images in one click.\r\n* Use the \"Pixiv Image Searches and Stuff\":https://github.com/nottalulah/userscripts/raw/master/Pixiv_Image_Searches_and_Stuff.user.js and \"Translated Pixiv Tags\":https://github.com/evazion/translate-pixiv-tags#installation userscripts to check if images have already been uploaded to Danbooru.\r\n* Use the \"Image Search Options\":https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-search-options/kljmejbpilkadikecejccebmccagifhl browser extension to check if something has already been uploaded to Danbooru, or to find the original source.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do upload limits work?]\r\n\r\nWhen you first start, you can have up to 15 {{is:pending|pending}} posts in the moderation queue at once. If you hit your upload limit, you have to wait until your uploads are either approved or deleted in three days before you can upload again.\r\n\r\nYour upload limit goes up as your uploads are approved, and goes down if your uploads are deleted. When you first start, you need 10 approvals for your upload limit to go up. Every time your limit goes up, you need 2 more approvals to get to the next level. Your limit will go down after every 3 deletions.\r\n\r\nSee [[about:upload limits]] for more details.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How does the moderation system work?]\r\n\r\nAll new uploads go through a moderation queue, where they're reviewed by a team of approvers. Posts have three days to be approved. If they're not approved by anyone in three days, then they're deleted.\r\n\r\nAll it takes is a single approver liking a post for it to be approved. Posts are only deleted if every approver who sees it doesn't think it's good enough to be approved. Most posts are deleted because multiple approvers saw it and none of them thought it met Danbooru's standards.\r\n\r\nUsually there are around 10 to 15 active approvers at any given time. \r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=Why did my upload get deleted?]\r\n\r\nUsually because it didn't meet Danbooru's quality standards. You can ask for feedback in the \"Upload feedback thread\":/forum_topics/7934 if you're not sure why something was deleted. Keep in mind there often isn't much to say beyond \"it wasn't very good\".\r\n\r\nIf you think your post was unfairly deleted, you can appeal it. Go to the deleted post, then click the \"Appeal\" button in the sidebar. This will put it back in the moderation queue for another three days, where it has another chance to be approved.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that if you appeal something immediately after it was deleted, it will probably be seen by the same people who passed over it the first time. Waiting a few days can improve your odds.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=I don't like the moderation system]\r\n\r\nDeleted posts can still be seen by everyone. They're simply filtered out of searches by default. To see deleted posts, add {{is:deleted}} to your searches or click the \"Deleted\" button in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nIf you want to always see deleted posts, you can go to your \"account settings\":/settings and enable the \"Show deleted posts\" option. This lets you effectively ignore the moderation system.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I tag a post?]\r\n\r\nTo add a tag, click the \"Edit\" button beneath the image and add your tags in the \"Tags\" box. To remove a tag, simply delete the tag from the Tags box. Click the \"Submit\" button when you're done. \r\n\r\nAnyone can add or remove tags on a post. You don't need any special privileges. All you need is to \"create an account\":/users/new first.\r\n\r\nTip: you can press \"Shift+E\" to quickly open the tag edit box in a window, and \"Ctrl+Enter\" to save the tags when you're done.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I make a new character or copyright tag?]\r\n\r\nTag the post with [code]character:character_name_here[/code] or [code]copyright:copyright_name_here[/code]. For example, tagging a post with [code]character:hatsune_miku[/code] or [code]copyright:vocaloid[/code] would create the [[Hatsune Miku]] or [[Vocaloid]] tags (if they didn't already exist).\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I make a new artist tag?]\r\n\r\nFirst tag the post with [code]artist:artist_name_here[/code].

It's a called a bulk update request because it's a request to update one or more tags in bulk.\r\n\r\nTo make a bulk update request, go to the forum, click \"Request alias/implication\":/bulk_update_requests/new at the top of the page, then write your request in the \"Request\" box. Give a reason for the request in the \"Reason\" box.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new forum thread where other users can discuss and vote on your request. An admin must approve your request for it to go through. Look at other threads to get a feel for how to write your request.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a tag alias?]\r\n\r\nAn alias is an alternate name for a tag. For example, [[yellow hair]] is aliased to [[blonde hair]] because yellow hair is the same thing as blonde hair. Searching for [[yellow hair]] will automatically redirect you to [[blonde hair]]. Tagging a post with [[yellow hair]] will automatically add [[blonde hair]] instead.\r\n\r\nAn alias is used when two tags mean the same thing, or when there are multiple words people might use for the same concept.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a tag implication?]\r\n\r\nAn implication is when one tag automatically adds another tag. For example, the [[white shirt]] tag implies [[shirt]] because a white shirt is a type of shirt. Tagging a post with [[white shirt]] will automatically add the [[shirt]] tag too.\r\n\r\nAn implication is used when adding one tag should always add another.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I request that a tag be renamed?]\r\nGo to the forum, click \"Request alias/implication\":/bulk_update_requests/new at the top of the page, then write [code]alias old_tag_name -> new_tag_name[/code] in the \"Request\" box. Give a reason for the request in the \"Reason\" box.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new forum thread where other users can discuss and vote on your request. An admin must approve your request for it to go through. Look at other threads to get a feel for how to write your request.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I request a tag alias or implication?]\r\n\r\nGo to the forum, click \"Request alias/implication\":/bulk_update_requests/new at the top of the page, then write [code]alias old_tag_name -> new_tag_name[/code] or [code]imply tag1 -> tag2[/code] in the \"Request\" box. Give a reason for the request in the \"Reason\" box.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new forum thread where other users can discuss and vote on your request. An admin must approve your request for it to go through. Look at other threads to get a feel for how to write your request.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a deprecated tag?]\r\n\r\nA deprecated tag is a tag that can't be added to new posts. Tags are deprecated when it's decided they should no longer be used, usually because they're too ambiguous, or there are other better tags available.\r\n\r\nFor example, [[case]] is deprecated because it could mean a [[suitcase]], a [[guitar case]], a [[CD case]], or some other type of case. The [[case]] tag is deprecated to prevent people from still using it.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a tag qualifier?]\r\n\r\nA tag qualifier is a word in parentheses at the end of the tag, to disambiguate it from other tags with the same name. For example, in [[arrow (projectile)]] the qualifier is \"projectile\", to distinguish it from [[arrow (symbol)]].\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=What's a copyright tag?]\r\n\r\nA copyright tag is a tag for a game, anime, manga, book, movie, or any other kind of fictional universe or property. In general, copyright tags are for things with characters. They're called copyright tags for lack of a better name. Copyright tags are colored purple.\r\n\r\nCopyright tags aren't for brand names, company names, trademarks, or other things without characters.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4. Users\r\n\r\n[expand=What are the different user levels?]\r\n\r\nRegular users are called Members. Members have blue names.\r\n\r\nBuilders have purple names. Builders are people who have been promoted for contributing a lot to the site.\r\n\r\nContributors also have purple names. Contributors are uploaders who have been promoted for uploading a lot of high quality posts to the site. Contributors have no upload limits and are allowed to bypass the moderation queue.\r\n\r\nApprovers also have purple names. Approvers are in charge of approving and deleting posts.\r\n\r\nModerators have green names. Moderators are in charge of enforcing the rules and banning people.\r\n\r\nAdmins have red names. Admins are in charge of making site rules and dealing with bulk update requests.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[expand=How do I get promoted?]\r\n\r\nYou can get promoted to Builder by contributing to the site.

It was intended to fight other armored fighting vehicles and serve alongside the infantry-supporting [[Panzer IV]]. However, as the Germans faced the formidable [[T-34]], stronger anti-tank guns were needed. The Panzer IV had a bigger turret ring and so the roles were reversed. The Panzer IV mounted the long barreled 7.5 cm KwK 40 gun and engaged in tank-to-tank battles. The Panzer III became obsolete in this role and for most purposes was supplanted by the Panzer IV. From 1942, the last version of Panzer III mounted the 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24, better suited for infantry support.\r\n\r\nProduction of the Panzer III ended in 1943.
