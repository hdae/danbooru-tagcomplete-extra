The concept is for two or more people to [[defusing|defuse]] a suitcase-shaped [[time bomb]], one working as the \"defuser\" and the other(s) as the \"expert\" using an instruction manual. Each bomb is divided into individual modules which can be solved in any order. The bomb is successfully defused when all playable modules are deactivated. However, neither side can see the other's screen. In keeping with its name, the game relies on communication between the players. The defuser must describe the module they are trying to deactivate to the expert, who must then relay instructions from the manual to the defuser. Certain factors affect deactivation, such as the color and text of certain buttons, particular symbols, number and color of wires, etc. Each bomb allows a number of \"strikes\", or wrong guesses. If the defuser makes too many strikes or if the timer runs out, the bomb will explode.\r\n\r\nThe game was originally created for [[virtual reality]] systems and other systems supporting VR, but this requirement was removed in a 2018 update.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["完全爆弾解除マニュアル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162650,"created_at":"2023-04-18T20:24:51.662-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-18T20:42:19.628-04:00","title":"disarming","body":"This refers to the action of depriving one of their [[weapon]].  \r\n\r\nFor the act of disabling a bomb or explosive, instead use [[defusing]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["武装解除"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147254,"created_at":"2022-07-20T19:09:28.027-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-18T20:05:43.733-04:00","title":"yao_qi_niang","body":"Yao Qi Niang is a mascot of You Yao Qi (有妖气, otherwise known as U17.com), a Chinese website for hosting original comics and animations, as well as art through You Xiong (有熊).

It can transform into [[battroid]] (giant robot), [[GERWALK]] and fighter (jet) modes.\r\n\r\nThe [b]SV[/b] in its name actually stands for [b]\"Sukhoi Variable\"[/b] (or [b]\"Slayer Valkyrie\"[/b] according to some other sources).\r\n\r\nLike the [[vf-0|VF-0]] Phoenix, the SV-51 is an advanced trial production model equipped with conventional engines, a proof-of-concept craft developed and pressed into service before planned variable fighters with thermonuclear turbine engines. It can only fly in an atmosphere and is not a [[space]] travel-capable aerospace fighter like the later [[vf-1|VF-1]]. A variant called [b]SV-52[/b] with thermonuclear reaction engines was also researched but wasn't mass produced by the Anti-U.N. forces.\r\n\r\nThe SV-51 armaments included gun pods, missiles, and other ordinance. The mecha was also capable of being launched from underwater. The fighter design was similar to that of the VF-0, but its transformation mechanism was more complicated and took longer to complete. The SV-51 also had [[canards]] and tailplanes. Its wing was narrow and relatively unswept.\r\n\r\nSince this [[mecha]] appeared a whole year before the events of [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross]], many [i]Macross[/i] fans have speculated that the remaining units were seized by the [[U.N. Spacy]] and used for variable fighter research as well as aerial defense against the [[Zentradi]] during Space War I (like they did with the Anti-U.N. [[Octos]] mecha, according to the [i]Macross Chronicle[/i]). The SV-52 variant with reaction engines was also supposedly produced in limited numbers by the U.N. Spacy after the Anti-U.N. forces were defeated.\r\n\r\nThe SV-51 was designed in [[real life]] by [[kawamori shouji|Kawamori Shouji]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SV-51"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162579,"created_at":"2023-04-17T22:52:04.073-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-17T22:52:04.073-04:00","title":"tsukino_luca","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ルカ(ドラえもん)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":154394,"created_at":"2022-12-09T23:27:00.838-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-17T22:44:16.736-04:00","title":"doraemon:_nobita_to_buriki_no_labyrinth","body":"English: [i]Doraemon: Nobita and the Tin Labyrinth[/i]\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth [[Doraemon]] feature film released in 1993 based on the 13th volume of the same name of the [i]Doraemon Long Stories[/i] series.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ドラえもんのび太とブリキの迷宮","のび太とブリキの迷宮"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162578,"created_at":"2023-04-17T22:39:29.628-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-17T22:39:29.628-04:00","title":"doraemon:_nobita_no_kekkon_zenya","body":"English: [i]Doraemon: Nobita's the Night Before a Wedding[/i]\r\n\r\nA [[Doraemon]] short film released in 1999 based on a Manga chapter of the same name.\r\nIt greatly expands the detail regarding the day before [[Nobi Nobita|Nobita]] and [[Minamoto Shizuka|Shizuka]] marry.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["のび太の結婚前夜"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162568,"created_at":"2023-04-17T20:12:55.635-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-17T22:33:41.079-04:00","title":"doraemon:_nobita_no_shin_kyouryuu","body":"English: [i]Doraemon: Nobita's New Dinosaur[/i]\r\n\r\nThe 40th [[Doraemon]] feature film released in 2020.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is commonly depicted in Greek and Roman art, where it is worn by generals, emperors, and deities during periods when soldiers used other types.\r\n\r\nIn Roman sculpture, the muscle cuirass is often highly ornamented with mythological scenes. Archaeological finds of relatively unadorned cuirasses, as well as their depiction by artists in military scenes, indicate that simpler versions were worn in combat situations. The anatomy of muscle cuirasses intended for use might be either realistic or reduced to an abstract design; the fantastically illustrated cuirasses worn by gods and emperors in Roman statues usually incorporate realistic nipples and the navel within the scene depicted.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":140703,"created_at":"2022-03-24T19:12:02.226-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-16T08:47:03.557-04:00","title":"horn_(arknights)","body":"[i]Horn, Soldier of Victoria, here with you to face the crisis.[/i]\r\n\r\nA playable Defender Operator in [[Arknights]].\r\n\r\nReal Name: Rita Skamandros\r\n\r\nh4.

This revolutionary real robot show introduced mecha with armor plates that appeared to fit loosely over an internal skeleton. These detailed and somewhat plausible robotic forms sparked a fresh wave of designs in mecha anime that has continued to this day and can be seen in newer productions such as the live action [[Transformers]] films. \r\n\r\nNagano has also worked on some designs for the [[Gundam]] universe starting with the [[Zeta Gundam]] series from 1985.\r\n\r\nFrom there, Nagano went on to design elegant and graceful mecha for his manga The [[Five Star Stories]] that displayed elongated lines, delicate curves and a degree of decoration and detail that appealed to the imaginations of a generation of mecha fans. Nagano can be called an innovator in the field of mecha design.\r\n\r\nFool for the City, his first manga, came out in 1985 but it was 1986 that brought The Five Star Stories, which is still in production today. Nagano founded Toys Press, Inc. to publish much of his work. Nagano is a very versatile man and has been a professional artist, manga writer, musician and fashion designer. Some of his artbooks show him dressed up as a female character from [[Sailor Moon]] for cosplay.\r\n\r\nHe is married to seiyuu Maria Kawamura.\r\n\r\nNagano is also the co-author (along with Kunihiko Ikuhara) and illustrator of Schell Bullet, a novel in two volumes.\r\n\r\nHas since been involved with Automatic Flowers to create the anime movie [[Hana no Utame Gothicmade]], which he worked on as the producer, director, chief writer, character and mechanical designer. The film infamously hasn't received a wider home release due to Nagano's belief that it should only be experienced in a theater setting.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162344,"created_at":"2023-04-13T11:56:03.603-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-13T11:56:03.603-04:00","title":"k31","body":"The [b]Karabiner Modell 1931[/b] or K31 straight-pull [[bolt action]] [b][[rifle]][/b], chambered for the 7.5×55mm Swiss [[rifle cartridge|cartridge]] or 7.62×51mm NATO.
