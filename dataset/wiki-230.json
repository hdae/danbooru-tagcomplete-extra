The Heinkel He-219 possessed a variety of innovations, including VHF-band intercept radar. It was also the first fighter aircraft to be fitted with ejection seats. It's armament consists of six 20mm cannons, 4 in a fairing under the fuselage and 2 in the wings. But the He-219's most important weapons are a pair of Mk 108 30mm Schräge Musik (upward pointing at 65 degrees above horizontal)cannons. This type was ordered by the Luftwaffe to counter the threat of British bombers, which were targeting German cities by night. \r\n\r\nHe-219 pilots were often instructed to fly underneath British bombers and use the Schräge Musik cannon to destroy their targets, since all Second World War British bomber aircraft do not have belly turrets (gun turret fitted at the bottom of the fuselage).\r\n\r\nLike all German WW2 night fighter aircraft, it carried the Lichenstein airborne radar, with \"toasting fork\" arrays fitted on the nose.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately only 294 of these were built, and they all saw limited service.

One day, these youths followed a river and rowed their boat deep into the mountains. This mountain was an unexplored land in which no men had ever set foot. The youths thought that there might be a treasure in this mysterious, deep mountain, and so went to explore it. \r\nApparently, when they arrived to their destination, one of the group got out of the boats and reached the shore by himself. Just as he stood up, a large gorilla suddenly appeared. \r\nThe others looked in horror as he was grabbed by the gorilla. The 5 or 6 remaining youths quickly pushed away from the riverbank with their oars, and desperately tried to escape downriver with their ships. Forgetting all about their friend who had disembarked on shore, they concentrated all of their attention on escaping and ran away by themselves. \r\nHeld down by the gorilla, the remaining youth was terrified. Trembling in fear that he would be eaten, he did not have any choice but to try and obey the gorilla's commands. Following the gorilla, he was brought deeper and deeper into the mountain.  \r\nWhen they arrived, the gorilla beckoned others to come out by waving its arms and letting out a great bellowing sound. Apparently, it was the boss of the group. \r\nIts underlings - which were all of the gorillas - completed the commands they were given by it. The boss gorilla ordered tree leaves to be broken, gathered up and laid out in an open area, then ordered the youth \"sit, sit.\" Sitting down, he began trembling. \"This is terrible. I just have to sit as I am told.\" Again reacting to the boss's commands, the lower-ranking gorillas brought some food. They gathered many different types of food, including nuts, fruits, and bananas, and motioned him to eat. This was his meal. \r\nThis continued every day for one, then two months. The youth wanted to go home, but couldn't figure out a way of doing so. Since he didn't have a boat, he couldn't simply run away. Before he knew it, he had spent one year eating raw food and living with these gorillas. As time passed, his relationship grew with these animals. He began a relationship with one of them, and got the bear[*1] pregnant. A child was born. His life, stuck in the mountains, continued. \r\nEventually, the youth began to think, \"I can't stay here living like an animal, eating raw food with these gorillas forever. I have to do something.\" He began to constantly think about possible ways to escape. \r\nHe began cutting down tree after tree from the mountain and bringing them to the riverbank. He intended to use them to build a raft. Finally, he gathered enough trees to build one. \r\nQuickly, he started assembling his raft. Dodging the attention of the gorillas, he was able to spend about 2 hours a week on it. Since they are animals, they did not know what he was building. Finally, he completed his raft. \r\n Since everything was ready to go, the youth saw his chance. He prepared to leave without attracting the notice of the boss gorilla. However, on the day when he tried to ride his carefully built raft to escape, he had the bad luck of being seen by the gorillas. One of the large bears [*2] saw the youth trying to run away and quickly approached in anger. \"You want to leave me here and run away\" she yelled out. Although she was holding her child, she forgot herself in her anger. She grabbed the youth's legs, and her sadness and anger at being left behind burned up inside of her. She ripped the youth open from both legs. \r\n\r\nThis is the heart of women. It is a story that shows that you shouldn't treat women badly. \r\n\r\n[*1][*2]:\r\nOriginal notes: \"bear\" - mistaken rendering of gorilla\r\nNote from the quoter: This book contains another folk tale from the same teller entitled \"Bear Wife.\" It is likely that the teller simply confused the two in the retelling.\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* \"CiNii information\":[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BN02432533?l=en]\r\n* \"Google books information\":[https://books.google.com/books?id=zNLnygAACAAJ]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ゴリラ女房"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73564,"created_at":"2016-03-15T02:31:22.067-04:00","updated_at":"2016-03-15T02:31:22.067-04:00","title":"burin_crossroad","body":"A Japanese \"Wuxia\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia] novel series written by \"Fukami Makoto\":[http://fmkkoe.blog27.fc2.com/] and illustrated by [[Rebis]].\r\n\r\nh4.Characters\r\n\r\n* [[ryouka_(burin_crossroad)|Ryouka]]\r\n* [[Lei Shun Rai]]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia article (JP)\":[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E6%9E%97%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["武林クロスロード"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73562,"created_at":"2016-03-14T23:50:48.435-04:00","updated_at":"2016-03-14T23:50:48.435-04:00","title":"pyraju_youkai","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Aju_(maccha_an)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73560,"created_at":"2016-03-14T23:26:04.130-04:00","updated_at":"2016-03-14T23:26:04.130-04:00","title":"mirajane_strauss","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ミラジェーン・ストラウス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73538,"created_at":"2016-03-14T10:34:59.773-04:00","updated_at":"2016-03-14T13:45:19.069-04:00","title":"i_will_always_love_you","body":"A song originally written by Dolly Parton and released June 6, 1974.

The game is free of any real game \"mechanics\", minigames, schedules and does not even have an ending (except for the bad ends wherein the character dies or is expelled). The appeal comes from a the cast of characters and from the extensive customization options, which can be furthered by the use of mods.\r\n\r\nThe game has never been translated into any language and has not been legitimately released outside of Japan, but scripters and modders on hongfire, 4chan and other sites banded together to create an extensive \"release\" for the game, containing a huge amount of modifications, modding options, custom characters and voices. \r\n\r\nYou can buy the base game (in Japanese) from ebay with no difficulty, but it's region locked so you won't be able to play it. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested, users on 4chan have done an admirable job making it available, if not easy to obtain. An English-language install is possible, but you will need, among other things, the base game (off a torrent) an emulated CD mounter/burner such as DAEMON tools, the Illusion Wizzard by DarkHound, the dialogue translation, the HGG UI translation, the translated names pack, all the DLC (also from a torrent) applocale for reading the Japanese-language files (if your system is running 8.1 on windows or lower) or a locale emulator (if using windows 10). The game cannot be run on mac. You'll also need the install guide found on the aa2 general http://boards.4chan.org/vg/catalog (ctrl-f \"aa2\", you'll see it) as the install process is exceptionally complicated.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* \"Japanese Wikipedia for Jinkou Gakuen series (JP)\":[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B3%E3%82%A6%E3%82%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ジンコウガクエン2"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73181,"created_at":"2016-03-02T23:47:41.423-05:00","updated_at":"2016-03-02T23:47:41.423-05:00","title":"diola_(granblue_fantasy)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ジオラ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73180,"created_at":"2016-03-02T23:12:08.919-05:00","updated_at":"2016-03-02T23:12:08.919-05:00","title":"jason_robinson_(illustration_by_design)","body":"United States artist.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73176,"created_at":"2016-03-02T16:44:24.526-05:00","updated_at":"2016-03-02T16:44:24.526-05:00","title":"vairocana","body":"A [[buddha]] venerated in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.
