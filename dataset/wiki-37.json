These dive bombers soon found the carriers in the middle of fending off [[Hornet (Azur Lane)|]] and [[Yorktown (Azur Lane)|]]'s torpedo bomber attacks, leaving no combat air patrol to challenge them in their dive bomb attacks that fatally damaged three of the four carriers.\r\n\r\nLater, Nautilus herself tried to attack the burning [[Kaga (Azur Lane)|]] but scored only one dud hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

Even then, she took longer to complete as her original hull was damaged beyond repair in an earthquake in 1923 and had to be rebuilt from scratch. At the start of the war, she led the Fourth Destroyer Squadron and operated alongside her sister [[Jintsuu (Azur Lane)|]] and the Second Destroyer Squadron.

The real-life [i]Mogami[/i]\r\nIn real life, [i]Mogami[/i] and her sisters were designed by the IJN as light cruisers under the maximum allowed by the naval treaties in force during her time: 10,000 tons and 15.5 cm main guns.\r\nTo save weight, electric welding was used, aluminum was selected for the superstructure, a single trunked funnel was installed instead of two common to the older heavy cruisers, and decent armor. Unfortunately, the extensive weight reductions led to chronic instability while gunnery trials resulted in cracking of the hull welds. As soon as Japan withdrew from the treaty system, the class was taken in hand for a reconstruction that improved their hulls and swapped their 15.5 cm guns for heavier 20.3 cm ones as the class was specifically designed for CL to CA conversion with ease.\r\n\r\nIn the early Pacific War, she was responsible for the torpedo salvo that accidentally sank army transports in the battle of Sunda Strait, an act that was historically blamed on [[Fubuki (Azur Lane)|]]. Later in the [[battle of Midway]], she accidentally collided with her sister Mikuma, crippling her and leaving her at the mercy of US aircraft from the carriers and Midway itself. The damage sustained by [i]Mogami[/i] justified her selection for conversion to a seaplane cruiser that was completed in April 1943.\r\n\r\nLater, she was part of the first wave of ships in the notoriously ill-fated sortie up Surigao Strait. After the first wave under Shouji Nishimura was annihilated (except for Mogami and [i][[Shigure (Azur Lane)|]][/i]), Kiyohide Shima, the admiral leading the second wave, ordered a panicked retreat, causing the flagship [i][[Nachi (Azur Lane)|]][/i] to abruptly swing into the fleeing [i]Mogami[/i]'s path, causing a collision that crippled [i]Mogami[/i].

The manga was first published in 1982 on [[Weekly Shounen Jump]].\r\n\r\nThe original anime adaptation created by [[Toei Animation]] in 1984 sparked a massive controversy due to the anime featured massive amount of violence (especially for its time when \"Adult content air time\" did not exist), most notably gore. leading to massive usage of censorship on the anime, and the creation of \"Adult content air time\", a slot of airing time on Television specifically for violent anime.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the series' extreme violence and masculine-heavy theme had later inspired other action shounen and seinen manga and anime, particularly during late 80s and 90s era. Notable examples were [[jojo_no_kimyou_na_bouken|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]], [[Grappler Baki]], [[Bastard!!]] [[Sun-Ken Rock]], [[Berserk]] and recently [[Chainsaw Man]] and [[Jujutsu Kaisen]].\r\n\r\nDue to the unique [[manly]] artstyle, heavely inspired by 80s Movies like [[Mad Max]] and [[Terminator]], the show is also frequently subjected to various [[parody]] comedy doujins that were usually revolved around turning various cute anime girl into a \"[[hara_tetsuo_(style)|K-style]]\" style macho women (mostly involves the character [[cosplay]] and attempt to roleplay as their respective character) for comedic effect.\r\n\r\nh5. Story (anime adaptation)\r\n\r\nNear the end of the 20th century, a nuclear war engulfed most of the Earth's surface, reducing most of the world into a vast desert wasteland. The survivors of mankind banded together in tribes in order to fight over the few supply of uncontaminated food and water still left in the world, with the strong often preying on the weak. [[Kenshiro]], the successor of the assassination art known as Hokuto Shinken, wanders the wasteland after being separated from his fiancee [[Yuria (Hokuto no Ken)|]] by his friend-turned-enemy [[Shin_(hokuto_no_ken)|Shin]]. Accompanied by two young children, [[Bat (Hokuto no Ken)|]] and [[Lin (hokuto no ken)|]], Ken becomes a savior to the weak and innocent from the various gangs and ruthless bandits threatening their survival. Throughout the course of his journey, Kenshiro encounters various formidable rivals and adversaries, ultimately culminating with Kenshiro's eldest adoptive brother [[Raoh (hokuto no ken)|]], an oppressive tyrant who challenges Ken for the right of the Hokuto Shinken succession.\r\n\r\nSeveral years afterward, Kenshiro reunites with the now grown Bat and Lynn in order to stand up against a corrupt Imperial Army. The three, with the help of other rebels, manage to expose a conspiracy within the Imperial Army to keep the Heavenly Empress ([spoiler]Lynn's estranged twin sister, Lui[/spoiler]) imprisoned. The Empress is saved, only for Lynn to be taken to the \"Land of Asura\", a country of warriors where only the mightiest survive. Kenshiro crosses to Asura in pursuit of her, only to find himself fighting against the three generals who rule over the land. [spoiler]Kenshiro finds himself fighting not only against his own blood brother Hyou, but also [[Kaioh (hokuto no ken)|Kaioh]], Raoh's own brother.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nh4.
