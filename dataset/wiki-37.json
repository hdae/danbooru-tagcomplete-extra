The most common shape of the insignia is that of a shield, but the air force uses a round version on their vehicles, in which case there is a border in the same colour as the crowns. In its base form, the crowns are yellow on a blue fill. On military vehicles colourless versions are often used, with black (or dark grey) crowns and border with no fill, which is used on bright surfaces, or a white fill with black or transparent crowns and no border, used on darker surfaces. Very old army vehicles can be seen in pictures and museums painted with a rectangular version of the insignia in the latter colour scheme.

It influenced many sci-fi anime creators and helped to create the [b]Real Robot[/b] genre of piloted [[mecha]] (The creators of [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] from 1979 have cited Starship Troopers as an important inspiration).\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual produced a 6 episode Japanese OVA adaptation locally titled [[Uchuu No Senshi]].\r\n\r\nThe most famous and well known adaptation of the book is the 1997 movie adaptation directed by Paul Verhoeven and staring Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and Neil Patrick Harris. The movie has a mixed reception since some criticized Verhoeven as he never fully read the book and thought the books themes of militarism and patriotism was more like Fascism and portray the human government in the book as Fascists while other praises the movie as a satire of Nationalism and Military Propaganda.\r\n\r\nh4.

Detailed and specialized tagging is what made Danbooru become an anime-art [i]database[/i], instead of just a huge collection only good enough for casual browsing.\r\n\r\nUsers at \"Member\":[/wiki_pages/43574#dtext-member] level can be invited to become \"Builder\":[/wiki_pages/43574#dtext-builder] when their prominent tagging efforts are noticed. \r\n([tn]See \"Help:Users#Getting_Promoted\":[/wiki_pages/43574#dtext-getting_promoted] for more information.[/tn])\r\n\r\nIf you have any trouble or issue with tagging, please create a thread in the \"Forum\":/forum_topics to ask, or consider using an already existing tag help thread.\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Existing tag help threads:[/b]\r\n\r\n* [b]How do I tag this?[/b] (topic #12251) is for help on tagging things specifically.\r\n* [b]Wiki Requests[/b] (topic #12858) is for questions on the definition of a tag. \r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4#rule_of_thumb. Rule of Thumb\r\n\r\n[b]Tag what you see, not what you know[/b]. In other words, only tag [b]the visual and factual elements in the image[/b]. For example, images where the full moon is prominently depicted will have a [[full_moon]] tag. Ideally you should use an existing tag on Danbooru.\r\nThis means you should not tag what you know about a character.  For example [[Remilia_Scarlet]] is supposed to be a vampire, but don't tag every picture depicting her with the [[vampire]] tag. Only use the vampire tag if the characteristics are clearly visible. \r\n\r\n[b]Do not[/b] use [[tag_group:subjective|subjective tags]] (such as sexy, cute, hot, etc.). These tags are problematic because they are based on personal opinion, and different opinions can conflict. Images based on a subjective theme can be collected into a pool instead.\r\n\r\nExamples of pools for subjective themes:\r\n\r\n* pool #1636: Fund It!\r\n* pool #1908: What has science done?!?\r\n\r\nPlease consult [[help:pools]] for more information on creating pools.\r\n\r\nh4#minimal_tagging_criteria. Minimal Tagging Criteria\r\n\r\n[b]Artist.[/b] See [[howto:artist]] for more information.\r\n\r\n[b]Character.[/b] All featured characters must be positively identified.\r\n* See [[howto:character]]\r\n\r\n[b]Copyright.[/b] Indicate from which series the characters came from.\r\n* The [[original]] tag is used for art that is not based on any established works (anime, game, manga, movie).\r\n* See [[howto:copyright]]\r\n\r\n[b]Source.[/b] The original URL the image was taken from must be provided. If there's no URL, indicate by words from where the material came from (i.e. name of the artbook, name of doujinshi, imageboard, [[scan]] etc)\r\n\r\n[b]Rating.[/b] Sexual material must be indicated according to [[howto:rate]].\r\n\r\n[b]Spoilers.[/b] Some images are spoilers themselves, and must be declared with the [[spoilers]] tag.\r\n\r\nh4#general_tags. General Tags\r\n\r\nDescribing the image in simple keywords - What objects are in the image ([[gun]], [[jacket]], etc.)? Is there a particular theme to the image (is it [[Christmas]]? Is there a [[war]]? etc.)?\r\n\r\nRemember: There are a lot users who are not familiar with a character or a copyright, so using the following basic tags will enable those without such knowledge to recognize and search for images easily:\r\n\r\n* Character's features: hair length, hair color, hair style, decorations on head ([[hat]], [[hair_ornament]], [[hair_ribbon]], etc.), eyes color, and recognizable special attributes.\r\n* Expression: [[frown]], [[sad]], [[smile]], [[shy]] etc.\r\n* Actions: see [[tag group:posture]].\r\n* Objects: [[book]], [[cloud]], [[gun]], [[pen]], [[teacup]], etc.\r\n* Time of day: [[day]], [[evening]], [[morning]], [[night]], [[twilight]], etc.\r\n* Sexual content: see [[tag group:sex acts]].\r\n\r\nPlease consult [[tag groups]] for more ideas. See also [[list of commonly misused tags]].\r\n\r\nh6#blacklisted_tags. Commonly Blacklisted Tags\r\n\r\nThe following must be tagged to allow viewers to blacklist images on demand:\r\n* [[Furry]]\r\n* [[Guro]]\r\n* [[Loli]], [[Shota]] (see topic #8650)\r\n* [[Peeing]], more commonly known as 'urination'.\r\n* [[Rape]]\r\n* [[Scat]], more commonly known as 'feces' or 'shit'.\r\n* [[Spoilers]]. Repeated, due to its importance.\r\n* [[Vomit]]\r\n* [[Yaoi]], [[Male Focus]]\r\n\r\nh4#missing_information. Missing Information\r\n\r\n[[Source_request]], if the source of the image (URL) is not known.\r\n\r\n[[Tagme]]*, if anything else (including copyright) is not known. This includes items and weapons characters are seen wielding, or exotic accessories they are wearing. [b]Do not intentionally use[/b] [[tagme]] as an excuse for being too lazy to tag own uploads. \r\n\r\nh4#using_related_tags. Using the Related Tags Features\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Note:[/b] This part of the guide only applies to the built-in tag editor on the Post Full View. If you are using DanbooruUp or any third party tools, please also consult the tools' own documentation for help.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nDanbooru's Related Tags features are a great help at finding suitable candidates among the tens of thousands of tags already in use on Danbooru. If, for example, you are having some difficulty coming up with a new tag for the likes of that seemingly exotic accessory that character is wearing on her forearm, Related Tags may help you find the tag you have been looking for.\r\n\r\nWhen you call on one of the Related Tags features, you will get a list of commonly accompanying tags for the tag that the cursor is currently on. It will also list the tags that are linked from its wiki page.\r\n\r\nAdd related tags by clicking on a tag from the lists that appear. Tags that have been added will be highlighted in blue. Clicking on a highlighted tag removes the tag from the image.\r\n\r\nh6#related_tags. Related Tags\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get a list of tags which commonly accompany it.\r\n\r\nConsider the tag [[witch]]. Calling on Related Tags will reveal that images with [[witch]] also tend to contain [[broom]], [[ribbon]], [[witch_hat]], and [[dress]]. Owing to the fact that the black witch [[Kirisame_Marisa]], a character from [[Touhou]] is very heavily featured on Danbooru's collection, both tags will also appear on the list.\r\n\r\nh6#related_artists. Related Artists\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get only [[artist:]] tags which commonly accompany it. This feature might find limited use most of the time, as uploaders should have identified the artist when they uploaded the image.\r\n\r\nHowever, it gives an insight to what artists have drawn on. Consider the [[Hatsune_Miku]] tag. Calling on Related Artists will show the artists with a high amount of Hatsune Miku fanart in their portfolio, as far as Danbooru is concerned.\r\n\r\nAnother use of [[artist:]] tags, to check on other artists who have participated in collaborations.\r\n\r\nh6#related_characters. Related Characters\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get only [[character:]] tags which commonly accompany it. This is intended to be used with [[copyright:]] tags. Consider the tag [[K-On!]] (full: [[copyright:K-On!]]). The list for [[K-On!]] will mostly feature names of characters from [[K-On!]].\r\n\r\nBeware that characters from other copyrights may creep up into this list. This happens because there is a considerable number of [[crossover]] [[K-On!]] art. Verify this with this search {{K-On! crossover}}. \r\n\r\nh6#related_copyrights. Related Copyrights\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get only [[copyright:]] tags that commonly accompany it. This is intended to be used with [[character:]] tags. Consider the infamous miko with detached sleeves, [[Hakurei_Reimu]]. Calling on related copyrights will list [[Touhou]] related copyrights, and crossovers featuring [[Touhou]] characters.\r\n\r\nh6#find_artist. Find Artist\r\n\r\nThis feature is intended to check your [[artist:]] tags\r\nand verify if they have been previously featured on Danbooru. However, due to limitations, this feature may not work correctly. You may find using the related artist feature more reliable. Check if artist names have been highlighted.\r\n\r\nh6#favorite_tags. Favorite Tags\r\n\r\nThis is a list of tags which have been entered into your [b]Uploaded Tags[/b] list in you Settings screen under your [b]My Account[/b] control panel.\r\n\r\nh6#limitations. Beware of Limitations\r\n\r\nThe Related Tags lists are arranged alphabetically, instead of by relevance, or by number of posts. This may cause complete confusion to taggers who are completely new to the copyright or characters featured on the image they have just uploaded.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is always advisable to research copyrights and the associated characters before tagging.\r\n\r\nh4#tag-consistency. Tag Consistency and Integrity\r\n\r\nPlease double-check your tags on the left side of the screen after applying them. If you have any tags with a total count of 1, a new tag has been created. Often, tag creation on Danbooru is not necessary. If this happens, please check that your tags have been correctly spelled.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that your tags are correctly spelled, it is best to pick your tags from the Related Tags lists, as doing this automatically enters the tags for you.\r\n\r\nh6#use_existing_tags. Use Danbooru's Existing Tags\r\n\r\nPlease use Danbooru's existing tags whenever possible, but do create a new tag if you are sure that it is not covered by existing tags or pools. If you aren't sure about which tag to use, don't be afraid to ask on the forums. Danbooru most often uses the original language's title when naming copyrights and characters, so always double check. See [[howto:copyright]] and [[howto:romanize]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4#tag_creation. Creating a New Tag\r\n\r\nOnly ASCII characters are permitted in tag names. Tags must be romanized if they're coming from Japanese or another language that uses non-ASCII characters. See [[howto:romanize]] for details.\r\n\r\nh6. Name restrictions\r\n\r\nTag names carry several restrictions, either for technical reasons or simplicity:\r\n* Tags cannot contain non-ASCII characters. This includes Japanese letters. Replace them with their appropriate [[howto:romanize|romanization]] if necessary.\r\n* Tags cannot contain asterisks. They are used as a wildcard in searches.\r\n* Tags cannot contain spaces. Replace them with underscores instead, as spaces are used to delimit tags.\r\n* Tags cannot contain commas.\r\n* Tags cannot end with an underscore.\r\n* Tags cannot contain consecutive underscores.\r\n* Tags cannot contain unprintable characters.\r\n* Tags cannot exceed 170 characters in length.\r\n\r\nh6. Tag types\r\n\r\n* [b]Artist[/b] names carry the prefix ''artist:'' or ''art:''\r\n* [b]Character[/b] names carry the prefix ''character:'' or ''char:''\r\n* [b]Copyright[/b] titles carry the prefix ''copyright:'' or ''copy:''\r\n* [b]Meta[/b] tags carry the prefix ''meta:''\r\n* [b]General[/b] tags are normally not prefixed at all, because all tags without a prefix are by default automatically assumed to be ''general:'' or ''gen:''\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. Naming a tag\r\n[b]Use singular nouns.[/b] This especially concerns tags about objects which appear multiple times in an image. Under all circumstances, use the [b]singular[/b] for the object. If an image contains a bin full of [[wispberries]], tag it [[wispberry]]. This greatly simplifies searching and tagging.\r\n\r\n[b]Resolving Ambiguities with Qualifiers.[/b] If the tag you are going to use had already been taken up for another purpose (other character with the same name, character with the same name as an object, character and series have the same name, etc.), add a qualifier between () to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nFor example Black Rock Shooter is both the OVA name and the female protagonist's name.\r\n\r\n* [[Black_Rock_Shooter]] is used for the copyright.\r\n* [[Black_Rock_Shooter_(character)]] is used to indicate the female protagonist.\r\n\r\nSee [[help:qualifiers]] for further reading.\r\n\r\n[b]New Character Tags.[/b] Always use the character's full name in your tags. Name order should appear the same as in the original materials. Commonly:\r\n* SurName_FirstName for Asians. Example: [[Shameimaru_Aya]], where Shameimaru is her surname.\r\n* FirstName_SurName for Westerners, and most other ethnicities. Example: [[Ken_Masters]].\r\n\r\nh4#see_also.

The aircraft was built for speed, with retractable stabilizing floats in the wings and the ability to jettison the central main float in an emergency, but neither the retractable floats nor the main float jettison system worked reliably in practice. The aircraft also suffered from significant mechanical unreliability and high maintenance needs.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the planned use of the [i]Ooyodo[/i] class was abandoned and the [[Ooyodo (Kancolle)|single completed ship of the class]] was refitted as a command cruiser for surface formations instead.  Only 15 E15Ks were produced, and none was ever carried by [[Ooyodo (Kancolle)|Ooyodo]].
