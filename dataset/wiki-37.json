Within anime and manga, [[K-On!]]'s [[Hirasawa Yui]] is most associated with the Les Paul, using a Cherry Sunburst Les Paul Standard (now Traditional). Other prominent characters include [[iDOLMASTER Million Live!]]'s [[Julia (Idolmaster)|Julia]] using a TV Yellow Les Paul Special, [[Bang Dream!]]'s [[Mitake Ran]] with a red Les Paul copy, and [[Bocchi The Rock!]]'s [[Gotoh Hitori]] with a black Les Paul custom.\r\n\r\nOriginal Les Pauls were released with goldtop finishes, P90 (\"soapbar\") pickups and either stopbars or tailpieces.

There is no automated system in place to accurately tag duplicates given how easy it is to confuse them for the above (with exception to [[image sample]]s where the original is already uploaded). [[Pixel-perfect duplicate]]s are no longer automatically tagged; refer to its wiki on how to check for them.\r\n\r\nh6. Notes:\r\n\r\n* [b]Do not flag a duplicate post for deletion if your only reason is that the post is a duplicate.[/b] Parent them to the superior image instead.\r\n* Don't add the duplicate tag on posts with visual differences ([[variant_set|variants]], [[revision|revisions]], [[textless version]]s etc.).\r\n* Avoid uploading visually identical posts.\r\n** Check for differences with \"DuplicateBooru\":https://duplicatebooru.zipfiled.info/ if you are unable to confirm with your own eyes.\r\n* Filesize alone does not determine the superiority of an image.

So named for the gangsters who supposedly demonstrate this technique in gunfights. Frequently combined with [[dual wielding]].\r\n\r\nShooting a gun in this way has no practical benefit under most circumstances and makes proper aiming very difficult. However, the style has become somewhat popular in rap culture and among street criminals (who do not often use the gun sight) due to its portrayal in U.S. film and television since the 1990s, which in turn was inspired by Hong Kong action cinema beginning in the '70s and '80s. It is believed that Hong Kong actors needed to hold their guns in this way because some Chinese-made automatics couldn't eject shell casings reliably.\r\n\r\nIt is also known that this type of grip was sometimes used during the Chinese Civil War of the '30s and '40s with full-auto versions of the top-ejecting [[Mauser C96|Mauser C96 \"Broomhandle\"]] pistol, which had an extremely high rate of fire and significant muzzle climb when fired normally. When held in what's now known as gangsta style and fired, the muzzle would instead \"climb\" sideways and thus sweep across everything in front of the shooter. A similar technique was sometimes used with submachine guns during World War II, but as they were significantly bulkier and heavier than the C96 it was considerably more awkward.\r\n\r\nh4.

Comes in four popular sizes (listed from smallest to largest): soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone. (Smaller and larger variations than the soprano and baritone exist, but they are very rarely used.)\r\n\r\n[[alto saxophone|Alto]]: Most commonly used and often in small jazz groups as well as large ensembles. Most distinct feature is that the neck is straight where the mouthpiece is attached. Convenient in size for generally all player heights, standing or sitting. \r\n\r\n [[tenor saxophone|Tenor]]: Slightly larger with the physical distinction being the curved neck. Second most common and can be just as essential as the alto. \r\n\r\n [[baritone saxophone|Baritone]]: Largest and with a deep bass-like sound, the neck has a complete loop. The size and the weight is considerably harder to maneuver than the rest. They are less common than the prior two, but can be still seen in large wind ensembles and medium to large jazz groups to provide bass depth.\r\n\r\n[[soprano saxophone|Soprano]]: The look and posture it is held is almost exactly like a [[clarinet|clarinet]].

[[meme]] based on a [[politics|political]] cartoon depicting an [[obese]] man looking into a pair of [[binoculars]] while asking \"Where are the poor?\" His large stomach blocks his view of a starving man below him. The edit that popularized the political cartoon as a meme changed to the text to state \"Where is poor?\"\r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, 2025, \"Twitter user @lilchiikawa_\":https://twitter.com/lilchiikawa_/status/1896693852435886433 posted a redrawn version of the meme featuring the characters [[Chiikawa_(Character)|]] and [[Usagi_(Chiikawa)|]] from the series [[Chiikawa]]. This version of the meme went viral, causing several artworks inspired by it to be made. Though in this version, the second, smaller character is often being covered by [[gigantic breasts]] of the first character instead.\r\n\r\nh4.
