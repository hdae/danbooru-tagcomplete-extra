He is the older brother of the Awataguchi school swords, due to the fact that he was the only tachi ever forged by Awataguchi.\r\n\r\nOriginally named \"Okatana Yoshimitsu\" (御刀吉光), Ichigo Hitofuri once belonged to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He ordered the blade to be shortened to match his rather short height. Ichigo Hitofuri was damaged in the summer of 1615 during the Siege of Osaka at Osaka Castle and then re-tempered by Yasutsugu under the order of Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, Ieyasu didn’t had the chance to use this sword because he was advised by the Priest Tenkai to avoid sending Hideyoshi’s swords (including Ichigo Hitofuri) to Edo. It has been an Imperial treasure since that time, alongside [[Tsurumaru Kuninaga]], [[Uguisumaru]] and [[Hirano Toushirou]].\r\n\r\nHe has [[short hair|short]] [[aqua hair]] and [[yellow eyes]]. He wears [[white gloves]] and a [[military uniform]] with [[necktie]].\r\n\r\nIchigo has a polite and humble personality and is shown to be concerned with his brothers' well-being. However, it seems that he keeps things to himself, such as the fact that he's worried about losing his identity (since he was retempered in the past) and is secretly displeased about the Saniwa having so many swords. \r\n\r\nFans enjoy portraying him as the big brother of the Awataguchi tantous, due to him being the biggest/tallest blade among Yoshimitsu's creations, not because he's the oldest among them. Either that, or he's presented as a foil to the prankster Tsurumaru.\r\n\r\nBecause of his in-game elder brother status, many of the swords tend to call him \"Ichi-nii\" (Big brother Ichi), which extends to his nickname outside the game as well.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["一期一振","つるいち","いちみか","一兄","いち兄"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159271,"created_at":"2023-02-22T09:17:18.002-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T09:17:18.002-05:00","title":"nakamura_sawa","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["仲村佐和"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159260,"created_at":"2023-02-22T07:56:50.357-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T07:56:50.357-05:00","title":"just_braven","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["JustBraven"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159257,"created_at":"2023-02-22T07:51:47.206-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T07:51:47.206-05:00","title":"dawn_(arknights)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["黎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":159256,"created_at":"2023-02-22T06:55:09.863-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T06:55:09.863-05:00","title":"adelaide_bluthausen","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アデライーデ・ブルートハウゼン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":74465,"created_at":"2016-04-11T10:48:39.710-04:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T02:34:22.067-05:00","title":"shinano_toushirou","body":"A [[Touken Ranbu]] character.

The plane is also a maintenance nightmare, due to the fact that its Jumo 002 engines have very limited lifespan of 21 hours of usage and causing a strain on Germany's lack of supply. Furthermore, contary to popular belief, the Allied powers have also deployed their jet aircraft into the European theatre (most notably [[P-80 Shooting Star]] and [[Gloster Meteor]]) during the early 1944, which means that the plane will not affect the course of the war regardless of how early it was deployed.\r\n\r\nh4.See Also\r\n* [[Ki-201 karyuu]]\r\n* [[kikka (airplane)]]\r\n* [[list of airplanes]]\r\n\r\nh4.External Links\r\n* \"Wikipedia: Messerschmitt Me 262\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Me262"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":18318,"created_at":"2010-05-02T19:05:25.331-04:00","updated_at":"2023-02-13T05:01:37.963-05:00","title":"p-38_lightning","body":"American [[World War II]] twin-engined piston fighter.

The original game was a beat 'em up [[video game]] conceived by \"Kishimoto Yoshihisa\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihisa_Kishimoto (creator of the [[Kunio-kun series]]) and developed by \"Technōs Japan\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techn%C5%8Ds_Japan . It was distributed in North America and Europe by [[Taito]] Corporation. \r\n\r\nThe game was a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, [[Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun]] (released outside of Japan by Taito as [i]Renegade[/i]), but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.\r\n\r\nHome versions of the game were released for the [[NES]], [[Sega Master System]], Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Game Boy, [[Sega Mega Drive]]/Sega Genesis and Atari Lynx, among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A remake titled Double Dragon Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The NES version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on April 28, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. Nintendo also released the Game Boy version on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2011.\r\n\r\nAnother remake was released for the iOS mobile devices in 2011, which features brand new gameplay, sprites, animations and music. \r\n\r\nSeveral sequels of the original game have been produced during the years for the arcade and different home consoles. A competitive fighting version was produced for the [[Neo Geo]] game console during the 90s.\r\n\r\nA new Double Dragon title, [[Double Dragon Neon]], was released in 2012 for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and is considered a reboot of the series.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary, Arc System Works released Double Dragon IV in 2017. It takes place shortly after Double Dragon II and uses an 8-bit artstyle.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[Jimmy Lee]]\r\n* [[Billy Lee]]\r\n* [[Marian Kelly]]\r\n\r\nh4.
