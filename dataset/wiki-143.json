Since then the Sidewinder has proved to be an enduring international success, and its latest variants remain standard equipment in most western-aligned air forces. The [[Soviet]] K-13, a reverse-engineered copy of the AIM-9, was also widely adopted by a number of nations.\r\n\r\nThe Sidewinder is the most widely used air-to-air missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the U.S. and 27 other nations, of which perhaps one percent have been used in combat. It has been built under license by some other nations including [[Sweden]], and can even equip on [[helicopter|helicopters]], such as the Bell AH-1Z Viper. The AIM-9 is one of the oldest, lowest cost, and most successful air-to-air missiles, with an estimated 270 [[aircraft]] kills in its history of use. When firing a Sidewinder, NATO pilots use the brevity code FOX-2.\r\n\r\nh4.

Because of this, Itsuki gave her a bell to wear, so that he may know when she was in danger and could go to her aid. Before leaving to help Yae and Sae Kurosawa escape the village, Itsuki gave Chitose the key to his room, with instructions to give it to his friend, Ryozo Munakata. When Ryozo came, however, Chitose got so scared that she hid, unable to give him the key. After the escape attempt, Chitose blamed Yae for having Itsuki wrongfully imprisoned, not understanding how much he wanted to help them escape.\r\n\r\nWhen Sae's ritual failed and the Repentance occurred, Chitose hid inside of a cupboard to escape the coming darkness. She became trapped inside, however, and panicked, scrawling \"help me\" on the walls and frantically calling out for help from her brother. In the end she either starved to death or was swallowed up by the darkness.\r\n\r\nChitose wears a distinct crimson kimono, with pale gold butterfly designs, further alluding the game's theme.

It is the most widely produced precision-guided [[missile]] in the Western world, and is effective against a wide range of tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began in 1966 at Hughes as the first missile to use an electronic contrast seeker. It entered service with the [[United States Air Force]] in August 1972. Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft. The Maverick served during the Vietnam, Yom Kippur, Iran–Iraq, and Persian Gulf Wars, along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nSince its introduction into service, numerous Maverick versions had been designed and produced using electro-optical, laser, and imaging infrared guidance systems. The AGM-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating. The missile is currently produced by Raytheon Missile Systems.\r\n\r\nThe Maverick shares the same configuration as Hughes's AIM-4 Falcon and [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], and measures more than 2.4 m (8 ft) in length and 30 cm (12 in) in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Wikipedia\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-65_Maverick]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":133956,"created_at":"2022-01-09T13:22:51.581-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T13:22:51.581-05:00","title":"yachimata_kana","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["八街カナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":133954,"created_at":"2022-01-09T08:19:51.822-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T08:19:51.822-05:00","title":"takauji_cimi","body":"Original character by [[takashi (huzakenna)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":133950,"created_at":"2022-01-09T03:56:25.771-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T03:56:25.771-05:00","title":"komatsu_nana_(actress)","body":"A [[real life]] Japanese actress and model.\r\n\r\nh4.External Links\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Komatsu]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小松菜奈"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":41034,"created_at":"2012-12-16T19:40:15.725-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T02:00:56.078-05:00","title":"glenda_(puchi_puri_yucie)","body":"The princess of the [[Demon]] World with elegant beauty and fantastic magical powers.
