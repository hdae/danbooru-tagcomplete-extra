The film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers. \r\n\r\nFull Metal Jacket received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for Kubrick, Herr, and Hasford.

Folk traditions in China and other East Asian countries have added many distinctive characteristics and legends to Guanyin c.q. Avalokiteśvara. Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva, and therefore wears chest-revealing clothing and may even sport a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists in the Far East, Guanyin is more often depicted as a woman in modern times. Additionally, some people believe that Guanyin is androgynous or perhaps without gender.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["観音","観世音菩薩","観音菩薩","観自在菩薩","觀音","观音"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":106512,"created_at":"2019-06-02T21:25:38.560-04:00","updated_at":"2019-06-02T21:25:38.560-04:00","title":"maa_(forsythia1729)","body":"Japanese artist.\r\nJapanese name: まあ (Maa)\r\n\r\nh4.See Also:\r\n\r\n* Pixiv Account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=17705294\r\n* Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/Co8Li","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":106502,"created_at":"2019-06-02T08:41:09.202-04:00","updated_at":"2019-06-02T08:41:56.950-04:00","title":"metal_gear_acid","body":"A turn based collectible card game for the PSP.

In addition to the  usual monochrome manga illustrations, she also produces colored works; her [[watercolor_(medium)|watercolor]] ones (e.g. post #363057) deserve special mention.\r\n\r\nh4.
