Dick, featuring the character of [[Rick Deckard]]. The book has been adapted into several media, including films, comics, a stage play, and a radio serial. The first film adaptation was [[Blade Runner (1982 movie)|]], directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. Although the film initially underperformed at the American box office, it became a cult classic, and has had a significant influence on [[science fiction]]. A novelization and a comic adaptation of the film were released in the same year. From 1995 to 2000, three novels serving as sequels to both Blade Runner and the original novel were written by K. W. Jeter, a friend of Dick's. A film sequel to Blade Runner, [[Blade Runner 2049]], was released in 2017. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Blade Runner in 2012, a short film was released, and in the lead up to the release of Blade Runner 2049, several more short films detailing events that occurred between 2019 and 2049 were released. The influence of the franchise has helped spawn the [[cyberpunk]] subgenre.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243581,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:45:21.232-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:45:21.232-04:00","title":"ivy_(summer)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Ivy (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243580,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:44:24.805-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:44:24.805-04:00","title":"ilyana_(halloween)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Ilyana (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243579,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:42:49.880-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:42:49.880-04:00","title":"cecilia_(resplendent)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Cecilia (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243578,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:39:51.997-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:39:51.997-04:00","title":"tharja_(resplendent)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Tharja (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243577,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:39:18.631-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:39:18.631-04:00","title":"tharja_(ninja)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Tharja (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243576,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:33:44.218-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:33:44.218-04:00","title":"igrene_(sworn_protector)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Igrene (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243575,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:33:22.690-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:33:22.690-04:00","title":"igrene_(ninja)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Igrene (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":243574,"created_at":"2025-05-24T14:31:07.850-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:31:07.850-04:00","title":"camilla_(young_beauty)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Camilla (fire emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":194727,"created_at":"2024-05-30T02:22:32.980-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-24T14:08:45.411-04:00","title":"tashkent_(the_sprite's_snapshot)_(azur_lane)","body":"The [[playboy bunny]] [[official alternate costume|costume]] of [[Azur Lane]]'s [[Tashkent (azur lane)|]].\r\n\r\nh4.

History\r\n\r\nThe [i]Tashkent[/i]-class of destroyers consisted of a single destroyer leader, built in Italy for the Soviet navy just before World War II. Three other ships were ordered but canceled before construction. The class is named after Tashkent, \"the capital city\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent] of Uzbekistan, under Soviet rule at that time.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Soviets found out that it was impossible to adapt Italian shipbuilding practices with the comparatively inferior state of Soviet shipbuilding, so [i][[Kiev (Azur Lane)|]][/i] was designed as a cheaper version of [i]Tashkent[/i] but carrying the same armament.\r\n\r\nOne of her in-game skills is named [i]The Blue Cruiser[/i], a reference to how she was delivered to the Soviets in the [i]Regia Marina[/i]'s interwar paint scheme of bluish-gray overall.\r\n\r\nh4.

Its eyes are notably elongated and squished, giving Metal Sonic an expression that many describe as [[unamused]] or oddly quirky.\r\n\r\nDespite—or because of—its unusual appearance, the Bootleg Metal Sonic Plush has become a cult favorite within the Sonic the Hedgehog community.

This [[meme]] originated around 2021 and gained wider attention by 2024, when content creators used clips of the plush paired with quirky audio to humorous effect, also coinciding with the character's appearance during the [[Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (movie)|]] film's post-credits sequence.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is the first game in the [[Sonic (series)|Sonic franchise]]. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. \r\n\r\nThe game features [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], who can run at supersonic speeds, setting out on a quest to defeat [[Dr. Eggman]] (Robotnik), a scientist who has imprisoned animals inside hostile [[robot]]s and seeks the powerful [[Chaos Emerald]]s. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay involves collecting [[ring (sonic)|]]s as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a new mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by [[Mario (series)|Super Mario]] series creator Miyamoto Shigeru. \r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Naka Yuji. The music was composed by Nakamura Masato, songwriter of the J-pop band [i]Dreams Come True[/i].\r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It is widely considered one of the greatest video games of all time. It was also commercially successful, becoming one of the best-selling video games of all time with approximately 24 million copies sold worldwide across all platforms. Furthermore, it established the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo]] Entertainment System console. \r\n\r\nThe game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into [[sonic the hedgehog (movie)|other media]].
