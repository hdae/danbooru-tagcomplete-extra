Appearance\r\n[tn]See post #3480676.[/tn]\r\n\r\nAs a shipgirl, Azuma is portrayed with [[long hair|long]] [[black hair]] and [[yellow_eyes|golden-colored eyes]], along with animal ears similar to [[takao_(azur_lane)|Takao]] and [[large_breasts|a sizeable bust]]. Her outfit consists of a [[white jacket]] hanging off her shoulders, likely based off Imperial Japanese Navy [[military uniform]]s, a button-up shirt with her [[lace-trimmed bra]] [[see-through clothes|visible past the shirt]], a black [[pleated skirt]], [[black gloves]], and dark-colored [[pantyhose]]. Her personality is similar to [[atago_(azur_lane)|Atago]], being very \"onee-san\" and gently teasing the Commander. \r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] is themed to act as a chair for her to sit on, with her three 310 mm triple gun mounts to her sides (two on left, one on right) on bow pieces, as well as two 100 mm twin [[anti-aircraft gun|DP mounts]] to her sides at shoulder level. She also has a reconnaissance seaplane to her lower left, while she uses a [[katana]] as a melee weapon.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\nAzuma is a never-built ship based on one of Japan's Project B-65 proposals. The B-65 project was intended to create a \"super-cruiser\" meant to replace the aging [[Kongou (Azur Lane)|]]-class battlecruisers and lead the IJN's cruiser squadrons into a planned \"Decisive Battle\" against the US Navy. Her purpose during such an engagement was to lay down heavy barrages against American heavy cruisers while being resistant to any return fire from them. While extensive design work had been carried out, no ships were laid down as Japan's focus shifted to replacing their extensive carrier losses after the [[battle of Midway]] and materials grew scarce. \r\n\r\nAs a reference to World of Warships, as per the collab, Azuma gains an ability based off of the \"Demolition Expert\" skill, increasing her high explosive damage and chance to set fires. \r\n\r\nh4.

The illusion features a simple pattern of light green and dark green squares, with primroses (magenta and white) in the corners of the squares.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed, the pattern appears to undulate or wave, creating a sense of motion. This illusion is an example of a peripheral drift illusion, where the brain interprets static visual information as dynamic motion. The Primrose Field Illusion is particularly striking due to its use of color, which enhances the perceived motion.\r\n\r\nThe illusion works by exploiting the way the brain processes visual information. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns and motion, and the Primrose Field Illusion takes advantage of this by presenting a subtle, gradient-like pattern that our brains interpret as movement. The use of color and the specific arrangement of the squares create a sense of depth and dimensionality, further reinforcing the illusion.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209092,"created_at":"2024-09-20T10:29:25.761-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T10:29:25.761-04:00","title":"ayakashi_tsubaki_(project_sekai)","body":"Premium mission pass outfit for November 2022.

The image is composed exclusively of shades of black, white, and grey. It is very common for [[comic]]s and [[doujinshi]] to be in greyscale.\r\n\r\nThe image may have small highlights of color (known as [[spot color]]s), but the image as a whole should be predominately greyscale.\r\n\r\nDon't use color tags like [[black eyes]] or [[black hair]] when tagging greyscale images. The exception is color background tags, so tagging [[white background]], [[grey background]], or [[black background]] is fine.\r\n\r\nh4. Guidelines\r\n\r\n* For completely colorless art, use [[greyscale]].\r\n* For a post consisting of a single color that isn't grey, use [[monochrome]], not [[greyscale]].\r\n* For a mostly greyscale post with a small amount of color as a highlight, use [[greyscale]] and [[spot color]].\r\n* For a post using a mix of color and greyscale, use [[partially colored]], not [[greyscale]].\r\n* For a colorless foreground and colorful background, use [[greyscale with colored background]], not [[greyscale]] or [[partially colored]].\r\n* For a post that has solid black shadings, use [[greyscale]] and [[high contrast]].\r\n* For posts with a small variety of colors but more than two actual colors, use [[limited palette]], not [[greyscale]] or [[monochrome]].\r\n\r\nh4.
