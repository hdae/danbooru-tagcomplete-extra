The high-quality private education from her family, along with her natural strength and intelligence, made her an outstanding elite with both the brains and battle skills. She is extremely beautiful. She always wears tailored clothes, showing off the look of a perfect gentleman and a lady. She has extravagant taste and has a knack in \"aesthetics.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike normal succubi that seduce humans and absorb their energy, she summons and throws ice, pushing the enemy to move away from her. Due to this, although she aced her school subjects, her grades for the \"Seduction\" class were close to failure. It's very fortunate of her to have been born into a rich family, where she still can live without gaining human energy by herself.\r\n\r\nShe's from the same class as Yuze. She graduated second place after Yuze, who aced the mandatory Seduction class essential to the succubi. After having a tough time accepting her defeat, she thinks of Yuze as her rival - so much so that she changed her future career job from \"an orchestra maestro\" to \"an adventurer\" after seeing Yuze exclaim her dream to become one with such enthusiasm. In contrast to all this, Yuze considers Bianca as a smart and pretty friend. Bianca can't help herself sulking and pouting at Yuze, who is so undesigningly kind to her.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ビアンカ(ガーディアンテイルズ)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147813,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:29:17.959-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:29:17.959-04:00","title":"nyuunai-suzume","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["入内雀"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147812,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:23:07.041-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:23:07.041-04:00","title":"kani_hime_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["蟹姬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147811,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:18:52.040-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:18:52.040-04:00","title":"nekomata_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["猫掌柜","猫又"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147810,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:59.617-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:59.617-04:00","title":"nurikabe_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["涂壁","ぬりかべ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147809,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:46.186-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:46.186-04:00","title":"kinnara_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["紧那罗","緊那羅"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147808,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:36.256-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:36.256-04:00","title":"kidoumaru_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["鬼童丸"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147807,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:27.385-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:27.385-04:00","title":"ungaikyou_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["云外镜","雲外鏡"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147806,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:55.476-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:55.476-04:00","title":"tenken_jinshin_onikiri_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["天剑韧心鬼切","天剣刃心鬼切"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147805,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:38.740-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:38.740-04:00","title":"mushishi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["虫师","蟲師"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147804,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:27.256-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:27.256-04:00","title":"kisei_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["弈","棋聖"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147803,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:07.131-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:07.131-04:00","title":"kosode_no_te_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小袖之手","小袖の手"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147801,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:19.760-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:19.760-04:00","title":"komatsumaru_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小松丸"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147800,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:12.719-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:12.719-04:00","title":"usagimaru_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["兔丸"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147799,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:58.900-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:58.900-04:00","title":"kingyo_hime_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["金鱼姬","金魚姫"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147798,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:42.854-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:42.854-04:00","title":"korouka_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["古笼火","古籠火"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147797,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:19.018-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:19.018-04:00","title":"jorougumo_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["络新妇","絡新婦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147796,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:04.403-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:04.403-04:00","title":"futakuchi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["二口女"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147795,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:56.210-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:56.210-04:00","title":"kamaitachi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["镰鼬","鎌鼬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147794,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:37.367-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:37.367-04:00","title":"ryoumenbotoke_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["两面佛","両面仏"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147793,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:17.750-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:17.750-04:00","title":"umibouzu_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["海坊主"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147792,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:07.186-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:07.186-04:00","title":"yamawaro_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["山童"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147791,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:01.321-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:01.321-04:00","title":"kairaishi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["傀儡师"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147790,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:44.610-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:44.610-04:00","title":"kudagitsune_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["管狐"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147789,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:07.103-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:07.103-04:00","title":"ame_onna_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_na

Tiger anthromorphs are born in their tiger form. When they begin to realize their abilities, they can change freely between their tiger and human forms at will. Kanna also had a hard time changing into her human form at first, but she can now change freely from practicing. She can even transform only certain body parts as well. Kanna usually stays as a tiger, but she fell in love with using human objects after coming to Heavenhold. Now she stays in her human form instead.\r\n\r\nShe's Kang's older sister, and loves her little brother very much. There are only a few Tiger anthromorphs, and they have strong family bonds. However, Kanna's love for Kang is quite eccentric even for the rare white tiger anthromorphs. Kanna taught her little brother how to take his first steps and guided him on his first hunt. She came to Heavenhold because Kang had followed the Knight there first. She's always watching Kang from a distance, but rarely Intervenes. She believes personal growth can only be achieved by overcoming threats.\r\n\r\nKanna calls herself an exceptional Druid, but everyone else seems to think differently. Everyone rather believes the title of 'Super Anthromorph' is more fitting because of her amazing grip strength. She loves animals and plants. Despite Kanna's love, all the animals are afraid of her and the plants she raises end up wilting. Kanna severely injured a cute puppy by accident from petting it. After the incident, she claims she can only watch the cute and lovely animals from afar and does so. Kanna still calls herself a 'Druid' because of her ability to tame predators. No matter how ferocious, a loving and 'powerful' embrace from Kanna turns them into gentle lambs. \r\n\r\nEveryone can tell Kanna's strength is what definitely makes the predators submit. But no one has objected to Kanna's claim that she's a Druid because she can transform freely from beast and human form and tame predators.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147515,"created_at":"2022-07-26T14:21:12.868-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T14:22:30.012-04:00","title":"batsugun","body":"[i][b]Batsugun[/b][/i] is a 1993 [[science fiction]] vertically scrolling \"bullet hell\" [[arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed and published by [[Toaplan]] in [[Japan]] and published in Europe by [[Taito]], as well as in [[Korea]] by Unite Trading. \r\n\r\nThe last shoot 'em up created by Toaplan, the title takes place on a distant Earth-like planet where a global takeover operative led by king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII is set into motion, as players assume the role from one of the six fighter pilots conforming the Skull Hornets squadron taking control of submersible jets in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invading military force from the planet. \r\n\r\nIts gameplay mainly consists of shooting mixed with role-playing game-esque elements using a main two-button configuration.\r\n\r\nHeaded by Fire Shark designer Tataka Yuko, Batsugun was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and who would later go on to join one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 to continue working in the bullet hell sub-genre. \r\n\r\nThough first launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the [[Sega Saturn]] by Gazelle and published exclusively in Japan by [[Banpresto]] on 25 October 1996, featuring various changes and additions compared with the original version.\r\n\r\nBatsugun garnered positive reception from during its initial release in arcades but was later met with mixed critical reception on the Saturn as an import title. Nevertheless, the game garnered awards from Gamest magazine. It has been heralded by many as the first manic shooter due to its evolution of various gameplay features in the shoot 'em up genre and as an inspiration for other similar titles. \r\n\r\nAs of 2019, the rights to the project are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Yuge Masahiro and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":128192,"created_at":"2021-09-19T12:08:31.565-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T13:15:03.427-04:00","title":"mandragora_(arknights)","body":"Mandragora is a boss enemy in [[Arknights]] and the final boss of Episode 09.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["蔓德拉","マンドラゴラ","マンドラゴラ(アークナイツ)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147508,"created_at":"2022-07-26T12:42:08.612-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T12:42:08.612-04:00","title":"queen_mother_of_the_west","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["西王母"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147503,"created_at":"2022-07-26T06:22:14.366-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T06:29:25.159-04:00","title":"covered_piercing","body":"Where the impression of a [[piercing]] can be seen through clothing.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147502,"created_at":"2022-07-26T05:46:04.740-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T05:46:04.740-04:00","title":"nokkers_(fumetsu_no_anata_e)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ノッカー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147500,"created_at":"2022-07-26T03:33:40.406-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T03:33:40.406-04:00","title":"kuramochi_keito","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["倉持恵都"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147497,"created_at":"2022-07-26T01:42:53.012-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T01:42:53.012-04:00","title":"1g","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[1g no izumi]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147493,"created_at":"2022-07-25T22:23:56.741-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-25T22:23:56.741-04:00","title":"inari_(sennen_sensou_aigis)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["妖狐イナリ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51067,"created_at":"2013-12-14T13:41:13.091-05:00","updated_at":"2022-07-25T22:11:48.027-04:00","title":"seed","body":"The fetal form of a plant.

This summer, she's the lifeguard in charge of safety on the beach!\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the news about rising injuries on the beach when it's supposed to be a fun vacation spot during the sweltering summer, Succubus Adventurer Yuze took on the role of a lifeguard. Even when there aren't any accidents happening, the sight of Yuze standing on the lifeguard tower overseeing the beach with binoculars makes it feels as if dangers in and out of the water disappear. If an accident really does happen, Yuze will rush to the scene. Whether they're on the sands, in the middle of the ocean, or deep underwater she always rescues those in danger. Yuze will not stop, no matter how sweaty or wet she gets! Thanks to her, people struck by 'someone' while on a stroll or swimmers flailing in the water because of a sudden grenade launched by 'someone' are able to make it to safety.\r\n\r\nShe uses her monster-handling skills and powerful grip as an adventurer to face off against the dangers without any hesitation, whether it's a shark or Sohee. Her specially enchanted lifebuoy aids those she rescues by giving them a speedy recovery with healing spells and makes suppressing threats easier with offensive spells.\r\n\r\nYuze takes her role as a lifeguard with utmost seriousness, but can't just understand why she's gathering more energy faster compared to when she streams her adventures on NewTube. The conclusion Yuze could come up with was: 'the scenes of rescue are direr compared to adventuring on NewTube, so that's why they must be more popular.' There's been a shortage of lifeguards on the beach ever since Sohee emerged, but when Yuze started volunteering as a lifeguard, more people recently started signing up for the task as well.

Directed by Keiichiro Toyama and written by Naoko Sato (previously known for the Siren series and the first Silent Hill), the core mechanic of the game is the player's ability to manipulate gravity, allowing unique movements and navigation. The graphics are cel-shaded, which in Toyama's opinion stand out from the western photorealistic trend.\r\n\r\nThe game started off back in 2008 as a PlayStation 3 project called Gravité, before being eventually transferred to PS Vita. AI and visuals were slightly simplified during the process. However, Gravity Rush director thinks overall Vita suits the game better, because of \"its handy and accessible nature\" and \"the impression of a different world existing beyond the screen\" the player gets by tilting the device.\r\n\r\nh4.

Butler[/i]-class destroyer escort as depicted in [i][[Kantai Collection]][/i].\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\n\r\nAs a destroyer escort, she is of a small frame comparable to an elementary schooler. Her [[short hair]] is a [[blue_hair|dull light blue]] done up in [[double bun|double buns]] while her eyes are a highly light, dull [[yellow eyes|yellow]].\r\n\r\nHer wardrobe consists of a [[sleeve cuffs|cuffed]] [[long sleeves|long-sleeved]] [[white shirt|white]] [[serafuku]] with a [[blue sailor collar]] (oversized to fit her collar rigging) and [[aqua neckerchief]], a [[pleated skirt|pleated]] [[aqua skirt|aqua]] [[miniskirt]], a [[white headwear|white]] [[dixie cup hat]] with a [[black ribbon|black]] [[hat ribbon|ribbon]] and star ornament attached to it, [[high heels|high-heeled]] [[red footwear|red shoes]], and a [[thigh strap]] on her left leg.\r\n\r\nWith her right hand, she is holding a gun that resembles a [[p90]] [[submachine gun]] with a 5-inch gun used by the original ship on top of it and some armor plating on the side, acting as a magazine holder.\r\n\r\nShe has the [[Navy Cross]] hanging from her left hand side, presumably the one posthumously given to her namesake, \"Coxswain Samuel Booker Roberts Jr.\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_B._Roberts]\r\n\r\nA [[little blue whale (kancolle)|]] is seen alongside her. This is because the historical Samuel B. Roberts struck a large whale with her port propeller shaft off the coast of Maine on her first day of active service which caused her to return to Norfolk for repairs.\r\n\r\nZeco once remarked that shipgirl Samuel [[no panties|does not have underwear underneath her clothes]]. It is not known whether it was just a joke as it has never been apparent on official art. Nonetheless, fans took this as semi-fact to the point of being a running gag used by some fan artists. \r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nHer ultimate claim to fame was her actions during the Battle off Samar, in which she conducted attacks against [[choukai (kancolle)|Choukai]] and [[chikuma (kancolle)|Chikuma]] before being done in by a barrage from [[kongou (kancolle)|Kongou]]. Her valiant actions earned her the nickname \"The Destroyer Escort that fought like a Battleship\" and a battle [[star (symbol)|]], which she wears as a [[hairpin]]. Two other ships would go on to share her name: A [i]Gearing[/i]-class destroyer, and later a [i]Oliver Hazard Perry[/i]-class guided missile frigate.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nShe's voiced by \"Shiraki Nao\":https://myanimelist.net/people/42439 and was designed by [[Zeco]].\r\n\r\nThere are several things remarkable about shipgirl Samuel B. Roberts:\r\n\r\n* She is the first shipgirl in the game not created by a Japanese illustrator (Zeco is Taiwanese).\r\n* She is also the first shipgirl introduced outside of an event since [[uranami (kancolle)|Uranami]]'s entry into the game in September 2016.\r\n* In-game, she chooses to be just called \"Sam,\" despite being affectionally known historically as \"Sammy B.\" Either way, she is referred to by a unisex nickname.\r\n* She is the game's first American \"destroyer\" despite clearly regarding herself as a destroyer escort, pretty much the same fashion escort carrier [[gambier bay (kancolle)|Gambier Bay]] is categorized in the game as a light aircraft carrier. As a side effect, fan art initially had her as the representative American destroyer; the first bona fide American destroyer, [[johnston (kancolle)|Johnston]], was not implemented until roughly eight months after Samuel B. Meanwhile, the DE in her hull number, DE-413, is currently used by English-speaking fans as compromise shorthand code for the kaiboukan, which had no direct counterparts outside of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Conversely, the closest matches for the American DEs in the IJN are the Type-D (Matsu/Tachibana-class) Destroyers; nameship [[matsu (kancolle)|Matsu]] was implemented in late June 2020.\r\n\r\nh4.

Usage\r\n\r\nThe border and opacity of an embedded note vary depending upon its current status.\r\n\r\n[table]\r\n[thead]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Status[/td]\r\n[td]Opacity[/td]\r\n[td]Border[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/thead]\r\n[tbody]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Normal[/td]\r\n[td]Full[/td]\r\n[td]None[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Normal + Hover[/td]\r\n[td]Full[/td]\r\n[td]Black[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Unsaved[/td]\r\n[td]N/A[/td]\r\n[td]Red[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Movable[/td]\r\n[td]Minimal[/td]\r\n[td]blue[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Movable + Hover[/td]\r\n[td]Full[/td]\r\n[td]blue[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/tbody]\r\n[/table]\r\n \r\nOpening up the edit menu of any note will cause the opacity for all notes on the page to go minimal.\r\n\r\nh5#styling. Styling\r\n\r\nStyles can be applied to the embedded notes box by using the CSS class \"note-box-attributes\". Allowed styles applied to an element with this class will apply the styles to the outer note box. It's best to use an empty element to avoid apply the same styles twice to inner text.\r\n\r\nh6. Allowed styles\r\n\r\n* [code]background-color[/code] - Sets the background color the box.\r\n* [code]border-radius[/code] - Sets the radiuses of the 4 box corners. \"[1]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n* [code]transform[/code] - Applies a transformation to the box. \"[2]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n** The only allowed transformation is a rotation.\r\n* [code]justify-content[/code] - Sets the horizontal alignment of inner containers. \"[3]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n** [b]flex-start[/b] - Left alignment.\r\n** [b]flex-end[/b] - Right alignment.\r\n** Not the same as \"text-align\", which is used to set the text alignment of an inner container.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] Without this the note box defaults to a center alignment.[/tn]\r\n* [code]align-items[/code] - Sets the vertical alignment of inner containers. \"[4]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n** [b]flex-start[/b] - Top alignment.\r\n** [b]flex-end[/b] - Bottom alignment.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] Without this the note box defaults to a center alignment.[/tn]\r\n\r\nh6. Template\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div class=\"note-box-attributes\" style=\"\"></div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh6. Examples\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div class=\"note-box-attributes\" style=\"border-radius:25px;background-color:white\"></div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh5. Stacking order\r\n\r\nSince embedded notes are opaque, there is the possibility that one note box could cover up a portion of another box, to include the text in that box. However, the order of which box goes over which can be controlled by adding an additional class to the [code]note-box-attributes[/code] element: [code]level-1[/code], [code]level-2[/code], [code]level-3[/code], [code]level-4[/code], [code]level-5[/code]. \r\n\r\nA box with a higher level will be placed over a box with a lower level, e.g. a [code]level-2[/code] note box would be seen above a [code]level-1[/code] note box.\r\n\r\n[tn][b]Caveat:[/b] Note boxes without a level set are at the lowest level, almost like a level 0.[/tn]\r\n\r\nh6. Examples\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div class=\"note-box-attributes level-1\"></div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh5. Alignment\r\n\r\nAs mentioned under the [b]Styling[/b] section \"above\":[#dtext-styling], [code]align-items[/code] and [code]justify-content[/code] can be used to set the placement of the text containers inside the note box, since by default, the text containers are aligned towards the center of the note box. In order to get this to work properly, the text containers must be block elements, which can be achieved by either surrounding the text with a [code]<div></div>[/code] text container, or by choosing another HTML container tag (e.g. [code]<span></span>[/code]) and setting the [b]display[/b] style to \"block\".\r\n\r\nTo set the horizontal alignment of the text inside the text containers, you must also use a block text container and set the [code]text-align[/code] style property to either [b]left[/b], [b]right[/b], [b]center[/b], or [b]justify[/b]. \"[5]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n\r\nh6. Examples\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div>Text in a block text container.</div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<span style=\"display: block;\">Text in a block text container.</span>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh6. Illustration\r\n\r\nUse the following to determine how to use the various alignment styles and their properties to achieve the desired alignment of the inner text container.\r\n\r\n[b][\"image link\":[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/618878216815247372/987619816284246066/unknown.png]][/b]\r\n\r\nh4.
