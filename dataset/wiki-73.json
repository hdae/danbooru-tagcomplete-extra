Mega Man was produced by a small team specifically for the home [[game console]] market, a first for Capcom, who previously focused on [[arcade]] titles.\r\n\r\nThe game begins the struggle of the [[android]] and player-character [[Mega Man (character)|]] against the mad scientist [[Dr. Wily (mega man)|]] and the six \"Robot Masters\" under his control. Mega Man's nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in a boss battle against one of the Robot Masters that awards the player-character a unique weapon. Part of the strategy of the game is that the player must carefully choose the order in which to tackle the stages so that they can earn the weapons that will be most useful for future stages.\r\n\r\nCritics praised Mega Man for its overall design, though the game was not a commercial success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that would define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs in the [[Mega Man (classic)|]] franchise. \r\n\r\nThe first game has since been featured in game compilations, including Mega Man Legacy Collection for Windows, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Nintendo Switch]], rereleased on mobile phones, and become a part of console emulation services. It received a full 3D remake titled [[Mega Man: Powered Up]] in 2006.\r\n\r\nh6.

Some non-canon reference materials published in the 1980s speculated that the ship was a new build and was constructed for use as a testbed for the Transwarp drive project; Scotty's comments in Star Trek V about how the ship had numerous problems (and essentially broke down) on it's shakedown cruise would seem to support part of this theory.

Though the Mk 19 has a flash suppressor, it serves only to save the eyesight of its operator, not concealing the weapon's position. For [[night]] operation, a picatinny rail quadrant sight can be added for [[thermal scope|thermal]] and [[night vision]] [[optical sight|optics]]. \r\n\r\nDue to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, the [[weapon]] has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack [[boat]]s, [[aircraft]]s, fast attack vehicles such as the [[Humvee]], AAV and Stryker, [[military jeep]]s, and a large variety of naval mounts.\r\n\r\nh4.
