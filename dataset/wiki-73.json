She is a playable character in the game [[street_fighter_iv_(series)|Super Street Fighter IV]].\r\n\r\nMakoto is a young Japanese girl, trained in Rindoukan karate. Her karate style is very similar to that of Shotokan karate. Although having little fashion sense for a girl her age, she still hates it when she is mistaken for a boy. She develops something of a rivalry with kunoichi [[Ibuki (street fighter)|Ibuki]], as shown by their alternate opening when they fight each other.\r\n\r\nSince her father's death, Makoto's dojo has been floundering and her older brother decided to become a businessman, leaving Makoto to elevate her dojo back to its former glory. Horrified to discover the decrepit state the dojo is in, she first enters S.I.N.'s tournament in Super Street Fighter IV in order to win money to renovate it. During the tournament, she encounters and fights [[Fei Long]] in the hopes that the publicity will enhance Rindo-kan's reputation. Apparently she is the overall tournament winner - as her win quote against [[seth (street fighter)|Seth]] is the only one that says the character has become the tournament champ, and in her ending she says that she \"beats the pants off\" of all her opponents - however she didn't win any money since the tournament sponsor, Seth, was killed and S.I.N. disbanded. She decides to rebuild her fathers dojo by hand, and make money the old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nUltimately, she finds [[ryu (street fighter)|Ryu]] in 3rd Strike and challenges him to enhance her dojo's reputation. After her fight with Ryu, the publicity attracts a swarm of potential students to her dojo. Unfortunately, she enforces the rather counterproductive policy of rejecting aspiring students who are unable to defeat her first, and thus far none have.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["まこと","まこと(ストリートファイター)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":197946,"created_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:53.648-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:53.648-04:00","title":"nazuna_hakutou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ナズナ・ハクトウ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":197945,"created_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:43.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:43.000-04:00","title":"sequel_thirst","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SEQUEL_thirst"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":197944,"created_at":"2024-06-25T16:59:53.738-04:00","updated_at":"2024-06-25T16:59:53.738-04:00","title":"prosthetic_weapon","body":"Depictions of a person who has replaced a missing limb with a weapon instead of an ordinary prosthesis.

Kate is a Briton whose visit to Japan led to becoming an idol. While her hometown is listed as England, it’s made clear that she is specifically from London. She enjoys British pubs. Her notable physical features tend to be her large eyebrows and numerous freckles.\r\nShe seems to not know much about Japan culture or laws, as she is quick to believe minors can drive when she mistakes [[Kusakabe Wakaba]] for a child. \r\n\r\n* Age: 20\r\n* Height: 157 cm\r\n* Weight: 45 kg\r\n* Birthday: August 15\r\n* Blood type: O\r\n* Three sizes: 83-59-85\r\n* Hobbies: Looking at Japanese magazines\r\n* Writing Hand: Right\r\n* Horoscope: Leo\r\n* Hometown: England\r\n\r\nh4.
