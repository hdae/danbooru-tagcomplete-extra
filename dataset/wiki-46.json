The complete vehicle was 10.2 metres (33 ft 6 in) long, 3.71 metres (12 ft 2 in) wide and 3.63 metres (11.9 ft) high. Weighing 188 metric tons, the Maus's main armament was the Krupp-designed 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, based on the 12.8 cm Pak 44 anti-tank field artillery piece also used in the casemate-type [[Jagdtiger]] tank destroyer, with a coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun. The 128 mm gun was powerful enough to destroy all Allied armored fighting vehicles then in service, some at ranges exceeding 3,500 metres (3,800 yd).\r\n\r\nHowever, the vehicle's extreme weight meant that it was ridiculously slow and impractical, being a perfect target for bombing runs by aircraft. In addition, it was a logistical nightmare, needing absurd amounts of fuel and being difficult to maintain and repair. If fielded in large numbers, it would most likely not have had any significant effect on the war effort due to its complete unsuitability for the mobile, air-dominated battlefield. Only two prototypes were constructed, the first of which did not have an actual turret. The second prototype had its hull destroyed by the Germans to prevent Russian forces from capturing it. The surviving Maus in Kublinka tank museum today is the turret from the second prototype on the hull of the first prototype.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[List of Ground Vehicles]]\r\n\r\nh4.

She simply gave her scarf to the Roma snowman.\r\n\r\nHistorically, [i]Italia[/i] was the rename of [i]Littorio[/i] after [[Benito Mussolini]] fell from power, and [i]Littorio[/i] was captured by the Allies, as the original name had Fascist connotations.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["イタリア"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":239238,"created_at":"2025-04-24T23:22:24.530-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-24T23:22:24.530-04:00","title":"haar_(resplendent)_(fire_emblem)","body":"An [[official alternate costume]] for [[Haar_(fire_emblem)|]] in [[Fire Emblem Heroes]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":106417,"created_at":"2019-05-25T10:06:59.223-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-24T23:21:30.170-04:00","title":"colorado_(kancolle)","body":"[[Kantai Collection]]'s personification of the US Navy battleship USS [i]Colorado[/i] (BB-45). \r\nCharacter design by [[Parsley-F]].\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\n\r\nLike [[iowa (kancolle)|Iowa]] before her, she is given traits, based upon some old WWII-era US Navy pin-ups such as: [[short hair|short]] [[blonde hair]] with [[side braids]], [[blue eyes]], and a [[large breasts|well endowed]] yet petite body. She wears a [[grey hat|grey]] [[garrison cap]], yardarm [[headgear]] that is already typical for the Big 7, a two-part [[grey dress|gray]] [[pleated dress]] with blue accents and a [[sleeveless]] [[white shirt]] that [[sideboob|exposes one side of each breast]], a [[blue necktie]] with the number 45 on it, [[black gloves|black]] and grey [[elbow gloves]], [[black pantyhose]], a grey [[capelet]] with blue underside, and red [[high heels|high-heeled shoes]].\r\n\r\nHer machinery includes her famed 16-inch guns (four at each side in twin [[ship turret|turrets]]), a [[smokestack]] and a [[lattice mast]] with a large clock face among others. She is given a remodel which trades the clock face for a radar antenna atop the mast, paints her wooden deck grey and modernizes her secondary and anti-aircraft guns.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe historical USS [i]Colorado[/i] saw a long and active career that took her into both Atlantic and Pacific oceans. She participated in a number of fleet exercises in the inter-war years, and also briefly served in various tasks such as becoming a training ship, and even assisting in the search for Amelia Earhart. During WWII, [i]Colorado[/i] saw extensive action throughout the Pacific against the Japanese, being a constant presence in pre-invasion shelling and fire support actions from Tarawa all the way to Okinawa. For her service, the battleship was awarded seven battle stars. After the war, she participated in \"Operation Magic Carpet\" to bring US troops back home. She was decommissioned in 1947 and sold for scrap in 1959.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nShe is named after the state of Colorado, the second such ship in the US Navy but the third to carry the name (the first USS [i]Colorado[/i], a steam screw frigate, was named after the Colorado River).\r\n\r\nShe is the first foreign shipgirl as well as the first personified battleship for her artist [[Parsley-f]]. She is also the fourth (second foreign) member of the so-called Big 7 (the seven battleships with 16-inch guns built before WWII) in the game, joining [[nagato (kancolle)|Nagato]], [[mutsu (kancolle)|Mutsu]], and [[nelson (kancolle)|Nelson]].\r\n\r\nIn comparison to the other Big 7 in the game, she is given a petite body and a more youthful appearance, reflecting the fact the Colorado-class battleships were the shortest of the Big 7 at 624 feet 3 inches (190.27 m) each, compared to the Nagato-class at 708 feet (215.8 m; later lengthened to 738 feet/224.94 m) each and the Nelson-class at 710 feet (216.4 m) each. In spite of this shorter length, their displacement was equal to that of her counterparts, at 32,600 long tons unloaded (compare the Nagato-class at 32,200 long tons and the Nelson-class at 33,300 long tons), which is reflected by her curvaceous figure and ample bosom.\r\n\r\nh4.

HOOOOOOO.....!!!!![/i] - Lion-O, Lord of the ThunderCats.\r\n\r\n[i][b]ThunderCats[/b][/i] is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[Furry]] animated television series that was produced by Rankin/Bass Productions debuting in 1985, based on the characters created by Tobin \"Ted\" Wolf. It was originally intended as an attempt to profit from the success of previous similar shows like [[Masters of the Universe]].\r\n\r\nThe series follows the adventures of a group of catlike humanoid aliens with super powers. \r\n\r\nThe cartoon, for which Leonard Starr was the head writer, became extremely popular and lasted 4 seasons. The animation for the episodes is notable because it actually was provided by the Japanese studio Pacific Animation Corporation, later acquired in 1989 to form Walt Disney Animation Japan. Thus the animation was made in an 80s anime style.\r\n\r\nThe series was originally distributed by Rankin-Bass Productions' then-parent company Telepictures Corporation, which would later merge with Lorimar Productions in 1986. In 1989 Lorimar-Telepictures was purchased by Warner Bros, who has owned the rights for the series since then.\r\n\r\nThere were also several comic book series produced: A [[Marvel]] Comics' version (currently owned by Warner Bros. rival Disney), 1984 to 1988; and five series by Wildstorm, an imprint of DC Comics (Warner Bros.' corporate sibling), beginning in 2003. Items of clothing featuring the ThunderCats logo and DVD boxsets of the original series have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years as nostalgia for the former children's favorite has grown.\r\n\r\nA remake of the original ThunderCats animated series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and began airing on Cartoon Network from July 2011. Animation production was being done by Japanese animation company Studio 4°C. Despite an early positive response the new series was cancelled after only one season because of low ratings.\r\n\r\nh4.

As of 2001, the book had sold an estimated 300,000 copies, initially only available through mail order from the National Alliance. In 1996, it was republished by Barricade Books with a foreword that disavowed the novel. The Turner Diaries was described as being \"explicitly racist and anti-Semitic\" by [[The New York Times]].\r\n\r\nThe book has been influential in shaping white nationalism and the later development of the white genocide conspiracy theory. It has also inspired numerous hate crimes and acts of terrorism, including the 1984 assassination of [[Alan Berg]], the [[1995 Oklahoma City bombing]], and the [[1999 London nail bombings]]. It is estimated to have influenced perpetrators in over 200 killings.

On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine [[military]] personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed during the hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was a major [[Cold War]] episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus described its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty and culture.  \r\n\r\nThe conflict had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratisation of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year.  \r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid. The islands continue to operate as a self-governing British Overseas Territory.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フォークランド紛争","フォークランドふんそう"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":91540,"created_at":"2017-10-26T01:13:39.251-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-23T01:24:44.023-04:00","title":"argentina","body":"A country in South America.

Their full proper name are \"M78 Ultraman Fuwafuwa o Suwari Nuigurumi\", often shortened to just \"M78 Fuwafuwa\". They are based on the SD Ultraman style 'M78 Ultraman' designed by Nakata Kazuyuki, originally for [[Bandai]], starting from 1990 (with the designs featuring in merchandising, as well as in the 1999 short anime film Ultraman M78 Gekijou Love & Peace).\r\n\r\nCommonly referred to as fuwa(fuwa)s, the release of the plushes inspired a whole wave of fanart based on the M78 Ultraman artstyle, sometimes emphasizing this inspiration by adding plush-like fuzzy lines to the characters. A parallel set of plushes exist, referred to as \"M78 [[mochimochi mascot|Mochimochi]]\" (or in full \"M78 Ultraman Mochimochite Nori Nuigurumi\"), which render the plushes as flying rather than sitting. They are included under this tag.\r\n\r\nUse this tag for both the plushes, as well as art in the style of the plushes. Though the original M78 Ultraman style also remains popular (with a theme park using the style existing since 2008, for example), art inspired by the plushes generally renders the characters much rounder.\r\n\r\nh4.
