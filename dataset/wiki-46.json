It blooms in mid to late winter, as the common name suggests.\r\n\r\nWinter daphne flowers grow in clusters, usually at the end of stems surrounded by leaves. The flowers have four pointed petals, with two upper petals overlapping the two lower petals; the petals are actually tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals). The flowers are creamy white and pink to purple, usually whitish or pinkish on the inside and pink to purple on the outside. Although rare, the plant sometimes produces berries after flowering.

Designed by Lira Wessex to feature a double-wedge design and perform a wide range of missions, the Venator was the first class of Star Destroyer to be manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Alternatively known as the Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, it was a versatile capital ship capable of serving as both a combatant in ship-to-ship naval warfare and a starfighter carrier, while also being employed as a troop transport, cargo ship, and supply and replenishment vessel. As a warship, Venators were protected by powerful deflector shields and boasted a range of weaponry. For its carrier role, a large flight deck, along with hangars to accommodate a complement of starfighters, gunships, shuttles, armored vehicles and other craft, was contained in the forward section, while three more docking bays were located around the ship. At least two variants existed, the Venator I-class and the Venator II-class.\r\n\r\nAs the backbone of the Galactic Republic's navies during the Clone Wars, the Venator was commonly employed by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic as their flagships, thus earning the moniker of Jedi cruiser. Deployed across the galaxy against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Venators saw action in many major engagements, such as the Battle of Christophsis, the Malevolence Campaign, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Second Battle of Geonosis. In the climactic Battle of Coruscant in the waning days of the war, over 1,000 Venators defended the galactic capital Coruscant against a massive Separatist fleet. Eventually, these starships emerged on the victors' side as icons of the conflict.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republic ended with Darth Sidious's purge of the [[Jedi]] Order and his establishment of its successor, the Galactic Empire, the Venator-class Star Destroyers were absorbed into the nascent Imperial Navy. During the early Imperial Era, Venators were utilized to consolidate Imperial authority, and later they fought against Separatist holdouts and fledgling rebel cells. They were also assigned to the private fleets of Moffs, and to flight schools. Others were scrapped on planets like Bracca, where they were dismantled and salvaged by the Scrapper Guild. Although Venators were still active at the time of the Galactic Civil War, they had mostly been replaced by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, a larger warship modeled on its Republic predecessor.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":126237,"created_at":"2021-07-16T02:47:00.511-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-07T23:56:01.655-05:00","title":"star_wars:_return_of_the_jedi","body":"[b]Return of The Jedi[/b] is the third installment in the original [[Star Wars]] film trilogy, the third film to be produced, and the sixth chronological order.

Or more specifically the 1908 [i]Dresden[/i]-class light cruiser and the 1916 [i]Koenigsburg[/i]-class light cruiser.\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\nEmden appears as [[2girls|two girls]] with one having a light-color scheme and the other with dark colors, each with a [[flower over eye|flower]] over one eye. This is a reference to the two ships named [i]Emden[/i] built by the German Empire, with the latter being a [i]Koenigsburg[/i]-class cruiser, being first laid down in 1916 and inherited the name of the more famous predecessor which were scuttled in 1914.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nIn real life, the first SMS [i]Emden[/i] was the second member of the [i]Dresden[/i]-class light cruisers, powered by older triple expansion engines (think of the engines on the [i]Titanic[/i]) instead of newer steam turbines, the last German warship to be so equipped.\r\n\r\nShe saw action with the East Asia squadron based in Qingdao and engaged in commerce raiding and an engagement against an Allied fleet in Penang, Malaysia in October 1914. Two months later, she was run aground after sustaining severe damage in an engagement with an Australian cruiser, and her crew were forced to scuttle the ship.\r\n\r\nThe second SMS [i]Emden[/i] was a [i]Koenigsburg[/i]-class cruiser laid down in 1916. She saw little action for the rest of the war. She is one of the several ships that were scuttled during the internment at Scapa Flow in 1919, though she was beached to save her from sinking by the British. [i]Emden[/i]'s hulk was later transferred to France as reparations before being scrapped in 1926.\r\n\r\nh4.

She often laments how ironically lucky she was, and if deployed together, [[z1 leberecht maass (azur lane)|Z1]] will comment on how fake her smile is; [[Prince of Wales (Azur Lane)|]], her enemy-turned-friend, also mentions this.

As a carrier she participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\r\n\r\nShe would finally meet her end during the battle of Cape Engano on the 25th October 1944 where she along with Zuikaku, Zuihou and Chiyoda were used as a sacrificial decoy force to lure the American fleet away from the landing beaches in the Philippines. She was crippled the 4 bombs dropped by US carrier aircraft and was ultimately finished off by surface gunfire from a surface task force consisting of 4 cruisers and 9 destroyers. Chiyoda sank with her entire crew of 1,470 officers and men, there were no survivors.\r\n\r\nh4.

What is the \"Copyright\" tag in Danbooru?\r\n\r\nOn Danbooru, the term \"copyright\" means \"the anime/game/comic/movie/etc from which a character originates\". [b]It does NOT mean \"anything that is copyrighted\".[/b]\r\n\r\nPosts not based on any established works should be tagged with the [[original]] copyright tag.\r\n\r\nIf you're unsure if something should be a copyright tag, ask yourself, \"Are there characters within this?\" If the answer is \"no\", then leave it as a \"General\" tag.\r\n\r\nh4#criteria. Criteria\r\n\r\nh6#qualifying_criteria. What types of things SHOULD be a copyright tag?\r\n\r\nAny anime/tv show/game/book/comic/movie, or a company that makes these types of things. Examples: [[K-ON!]], [[House M.D.]], [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], [[Harry Potter (series)|]], [[Yotsubato!]], [[Gone with the Wind]], [[Nintendo]], [[Kyoto Animation]].\r\n\r\nEven [[doujinshi|self-published works]], fan games, etc. should be copyright typed, for example: [[Touhou Musou Kakyou]] (fan anime), [[Narcissu]] (doujinshi), [[Koumajou Densetsu]], and [[Touhou Mother]] (both are fan games).\r\n\r\nVocaloid songs with at least one image on Danbooru also get copyright tags: for example, [[We are Pop Candy! (Vocaloid)]], [[Rolling Girl (Vocaloid)]].  These should all have the \"_(vocaloid)\" qualifier on the end to allow them to be grouped easily by a {{*_(vocaloid)}} search, and to avoid ambiguity in the case of ones like [[Knife (Vocaloid)]].\r\n\r\n[[tag group:pixiv projects|Pixiv projects]] are also considered copyrights: for example, [[Pixiv Fantasia]], [[Pixiv Festa]].\r\n\r\nMusical groups are considered to be copyrights as well: [[Kalafina]], [[Iron Maiden (Band)]].\r\n\r\nh6#disqualifying_criteria. What types of things SHOULD NOT be a copyright tag?\r\n\r\nThere are many types of things that, although they are copyrighted, should not be a copyright tag on Danbooru.\r\n\r\nFor example, these are simply objects, and so should be general tags.\r\n\r\n* Models of cars, car brands: e.g. [[Nissan]], [[Toyota Supra]]\r\n* Food and drink brands: e.g.  [[Caloriemate]], [[Coca-cola Zero]], [[Pocky]].\r\n* Gun types: e.g. [[Barrett M82]], [[P90]]\r\n\r\nTags referring to specific stores or their uniforms should also be general: e.g. [[7-eleven]], [[Anna Miller]].\r\n\r\n* However, [[McDonald's]] and [[Pepsi]] are considered a copyright since there are characters such as [[Ronald McDonald]] and [[Pepsiman]] originating from them.\r\n\r\nNames of songs from anime should be general: e.g. [[Ren'ai Circulation]], [[Minna no Peace]].\r\n\r\nWebsites can go either way: [[Wikipedia]] has the character [[Wikipe-tan]] and so it is a copyright, the same with [[Pixiv]], which has [[Chobi (pixiv)|]] and [[Pixiv-tan]]. However, websites with no characters, such as [[Yahoo]] or [[Flickr]] should be general.\r\n\r\nh4#guides. How to make a copyright tag.\r\n\r\nTo make a tag be a copyright tag, prefix it with \"copyright:\" or \"copy:\". Remember to replace spaces with underscores (like_this).\r\n\r\nCopyright tags should be in the original language, for example [[Umineko no Naku Koro ni]], not [[When the Seagulls Cry]]. If the translated title is widely used, you may \"request an alias\":/tag_alias_request/new from that to the original language title.\r\n\r\n* Note: There are some \"grandfathered-in\" exceptions to this rule, including [[Spice and Wolf]], [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]], and [[Fullmetal Alchemist]].\r\n* The [[Fatal Frame]] series is also an exception since the original name is the ambiguous word \"Zero\".\r\n* If there is official romanization of a copyright tag, it will automatically grandfather the tag. Example: [[Azumanga Daioh]] over Azumanga Daiou, [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] over Yuu-Gi-Ou.\r\n** See forum #168087 for details.\r\n** By default it is partial grandfathering since it is copyright tags which is affected unless there is an attempt to completely grandfather the copyright tag (copyright tags and character tags using English/North American names).\r\n* [[Pokemon]] tags were formerly partly grandfathered-in, as of topic #17160, they are now completely grandfathered-in copyright tags.\r\n\r\nIf the copyright name includes a subtitle, this may be omitted from the tag name. For example, the tag for \"Planetarian ~Chiisana Hoshi no Yume~\" is simply [[planetarian]] and \"Koihime † Musou ~Doki ☆ Otome Darake no Sangokushi Engi~\" becomes [[koihime_musou]]. Similarly, if the original title is the same or similar phrase in two languages, e.g. 銀の匙 Silver Spoon, or 幼なじみは大統領 My girlfriend is the PRESIDENT, you may omit the second part.\r\n\r\nPlease follow [[howto:romanize|Danbooru's Romanization Guidelines]]. Do not include symbols such as ☆ † ♪ ♥. Do include any punctuation such as ! & + ? . (Please note that the comma, the asterisk, and the percent sign cannot be used in tags.) Replace × with the letter \"x\".\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure how to romanize the copyright name, ask in a comment or on the forum.\r\n\r\nDo not use a fan-created title to [b]bypass or circumvent two-tag search[/b], such as [[Suzumiya Haruhiko no Yuuutsu]] for {{suzumiya_haruhi_no_yuuutsu genderswap}}.\r\n\r\nh4#go_back.
