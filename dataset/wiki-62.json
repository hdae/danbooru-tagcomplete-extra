Like his father and grandfather before him, the Engineer specializes in inventing and constructing machines and devices, from the mundane to the scientifically fantastical.

His [[wrench]] is used as both a melee weapon and as a means to upgrade his buildings, and he carries a [[shotgun]] and [[handgun]] for personal defense, as well as various alternatives for each. One notable alternative is the Gunslinger, a [[single_mechanical_hand|mechanical hand]] that allows him to build \"mini\" sentry guns.\r\n\r\nThe Engineer's default outfit includes a yellow [[hard hat]], black [[goggles]], black [[overalls]] over a team-colored shirt, a thick [[belt]] with several pouches, yellow [[knee pads]], and black [[boots]].

It was adapted into a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron and starring [[Christian Bale]] in one of his pre-[[Batman Begins]] roles.\r\n\r\nIt is a satirical psychological thriller that delves into the dark and disturbing mind of [[Patrick Bateman]]. The story is set in the 1980s during the height of the yuppie culture in [[new york city|New York City]]. It follows the perspective of Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment banker, as he navigates his high-powered job, materialistic lifestyle, and his double life where he engages in supposed acts of extreme violence, murder and sadism. \r\n\r\nThe novel is known for its graphic and explicit descriptions of violence, consumerism, and the shallow nature of 1980s society. It has sparked controversy and debate since its release and has been adapted into a film in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe film was considered a box-office disappointment but has since developed a large cult following. The film experienced a revival of popular interest in the 2020s due to its strong presence in contemporary meme culture, typically centered around Bateman's perceived \"sigma\" personality. \r\n\r\nh4.

Its resemblance to the word \"emoticon\" is purely coincidental.\r\n\r\nEmoji as we know them originated as a proprietary system by a Japanese mobile phone operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] using a Unicode private-use block to encode their emoticons. While other mobile providers used many other systems for emoji, this system was the most compact implementation used at the time (and the closest to the current one).\r\n\r\nThe very first Emoji were actually Unicode Dingbats, of which, quite a few are now official Emoji. Emoji became a standardized system with its implementation in Unicode 6.0 in 2010 but it's only around 2014-2015 that their use exploded and became commonplace to the point that they became a cultural phenomenon with real world merchandise and even a movie about them.\r\n\r\nh4.

She is the middle of three goddesses who come to Earth to reside with [[Morisato Keiichi]], and serves as his primary love interest. Initially, Keiichi thinks that her offer to grant him a wish was a prank by his senpai so, he makes a joke asking her to stay with him forever. However, Belldandy actually grants the request as a legitimate wish, and soon enough her sisters show up to see what's going on. \r\n\r\nHer older sister is [[Urd (aa megami-sama)|]], although they only share the same father, making them half sisters. Despite that, both she and her younger sister, [[Skuld (aa megami-sama)|]] don't seem to mind that, and treat Urd as if they were full blooded sisters. Belldandy's younger sister looks up to her \"oneesama\" as Belldandy seems to be the ideal goddess, although it should be noted that despite her sweet and gentle personality, Belldandy can be quite competitive and even shows signs of jealousy whenever someone gets too close to Keiichi. Still, the vast majority of the time, Belldandy remains calm and also displays a rather mature personality, even more so than some of the older goddesses and demons in the series.\r\n\r\nVoiced by [[Inoue Kikuko]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It is a combination of three different flags: the red St. George's Cross of England, the white St. Andrew's Cross of Scotland, and the red St. Patrick's Cross of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Union Jack consists of a blue field, known as the Union Flag, with a red diagonal cross (St. Patrick's Cross) that extends from corner to corner. This cross represents [[Ireland]]. Superimposed on the diagonal cross are two intersecting crosses. The upright red diagonal cross (St. George's Cross) represents [[England]], and the white diagonal cross in the shape of an \"X\" (St. Andrew's Cross) represents [[Scotland]].\r\n\r\nThe Union Jack's design was first created in 1606 when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms but shared the same monarch, King James VI of Scotland and I of England. The flag was officially adopted in 1801 after the Act of Union, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain (combining England and Scotland) with the Kingdom of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAlso appears in the national flags of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tuvalu]], as well as those of British colonies and territories. It is also on the flag of the American state of [[Hawaii]].\r\n\r\nThis may be confused with a mecha from [[Gundam 00]] called a [[Union Flag]] used by the world superpower Union in the series.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was the deadliest battle of the Second World War in terms of military casualties, with both sides suffering enormous casualties of over 2 million in total. It was also one of, if not, the deadliest battle in history of warfare, with the Siege of Leningrad (also during WWII) being another contender.\r\n\r\nToday, the Battle of Stalingrad is universally regarded as the turning point in the European theatre of war, as it forced the Oberkommando der [[Wehrmacht]] (German High Command) to withdraw considerable military forces from other areas in occupied Europe to replace German losses on the Eastern Front, ending with the rout of the six field armies of Army Group B, including the destruction of Nazi Germany's 6th Army (more than a million men) and an entire corps of its 4th Panzer Army. Out of the nearly 91,000 German prisoners captured in Stalingrad, only about 5,000 were returned alive years later in 1955.\r\n\r\nThis victory, along with the latter [[Battle of Kursk]], energized the [[soviet_army|Red Army]] and shifted the balance of power in the favour of the Soviets for the rest of the war.\r\n\r\nh4.

Unlike with [[unofficial Sailor Senshi uniform]], which just has one base design, Precure has multiple uniform designs for its main Cures and some villain teams. This is why the tag uses the term [i]costume[/i] rather than [i]uniform[/i] so that all of the designs for each series can be covered here.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t include merely an alternate color or an adaptation of an existing costume. The designs for both the character and clothing should be entirely different and not canon. This is usually depicted with fan designs for characters who never become Cures wearing their own unique adaptation of an existing uniform. It is possible for an existing Cure to [[cosplay]] as another one to the point of changing their hairstyle and adding/reducing embellishments to match the character they’re cosplaying. Another possibility is a [[light persona]] or [[dark persona]] being depicted in a fan made uniform based off of an existing one.\r\n\r\nThis tag could go hand-in-hand with [[alternate universe]] if it is a full-on scene of a fanmade character design interacting with canon characters, rather than a character just standing there showing off an outfit (post #1400262).\r\n\r\nConsider adding [[in-franchise crossover]] if the fan design for one series’ Cure(s) is directly based off of another series’ Cure(s).

Unlike [[help:tags|tags]] or [[help:post relationships|parent/child relationships]], the posts in a pool have a specific order.\r\n\r\nPools are typically for series of related images, such as [[comic]]s or sets of related images by an artist. These pools are called [b]series[/b] pools and have purple-colored names.\r\n\r\nAnother use of pools is for collections of posts that share a common, subjective theme. These pools are called [b]collection[/b] pools and have blue-colored names. Some of these pools are organized under the [[pool groups]] page.\r\n\r\nh4. Rules\r\n\r\n* Don't create pools for personal collections of your favorite posts. Use [[help:favorite groups|favorite groups]] for that. Personal pools will be subject to deletion in topic #8282.\r\n* Avoid creating collection pools when a tag would do.\r\n\r\nh4. Howto\r\n\r\nh6. Name a pool\r\n\r\nSeries pool names should generally follow the format \"Copyright - Title (Artist)\". \r\n\r\n* If the pool spans multiple series, you can use \"Various\" as the copyright.\r\n* If the pool contains images by multiple artists, you can use \"various artists\".\r\n* If the pool has an unknown artist (e.g., for official art pools), you can omit the artist part.\r\n* If the pool title is not English, you can either translate it or use the original language title. Unicode characters are supported in pool names. \r\n* If the artist has not given a title to the series, try to pick something relevant to the series.\r\n* If the pool is a sample of a series, add [sample] after the title.\r\n\r\nh6. Create a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the \"Pools\":/pools page in the top menu, then click on \"New\":/pools/new in the top submenu. Type the name of the pool, set its category, and write a description of it. Click submit to create the pool.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tag a post with [code]newpool:name[/code], where [code]name[/code] is the name of the new pool.\r\n\r\nh6. Add posts to a pool\r\n\r\nClick on [b]Add to pool[/b] from the post's page. A window will pop up where you can search for the pool you want by typing part of its name.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tag a post with [code]pool:<name>[/code] to add it to a pool. For example, to add a post to the \"Disgustingly Adorable\":/pools/903 pool, you could tag the post with {{pool:Disgustingly_Adorable}} or {{pool:903}}.\r\n\r\nLastly, you can go to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, then add the post's ID in the [b]Posts[/b] field.\r\n\r\nh6. Remove posts from a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, search for the post's ID in the [b]Posts[/b] field, and remove the ID from the list.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tag a post with [code]-pool:<name>[/code] to remove it from a pool. For example, to remove a post from the \"Disgustingly Adorable\":/pools/3550 pool, you could tag the post with {{-pool:Disgustingly_Adorable}} or {{-pool:903}}.\r\n\r\nh6. Modify a pool's order\r\n\r\nClick the [b]Order[/b] link at the top of the page while viewing the pool. You can then drag and drop the posts into the correct order.\r\n\r\nFor pools with over 1000 posts, the [b]Order[/b] link will not appear. To order these large pools, you should instead go to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, search for the IDs of the posts you want to reorder in the [b]Posts[/b] field, and reorder them within that text field.\r\n\r\nh6. Rename a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, change the [b]Name[/b] field, then click save.\r\n\r\nh6. Delete a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, then click the [b]Delete[/b] link in the top menu, then click the confirm button. To undelete a pool, click the [b]Undelete[/b] button. Pools can be safely deleted and undeleted with no loss of information.\r\n\r\nDeleting and undeleting pools may only be performed by Builder-level users and above.\r\n\r\nh4.
