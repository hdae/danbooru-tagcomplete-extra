It featured new semi-3D graphics, a more futuristic [[science fiction]] setting, and new gameplay features such as vehicles capable of hovering or burrowing. \r\n\r\nThe main story of the game focuses on a second war between the UN-backed [[Global Defense Initiative]] (GDI) and the cult-like [[Brotherhood of Nod]], both seeking to rule over an [[earth_(planet)|Earth]] which is undergoing rapid ecological collapse.\r\n\r\nTiberian Sun was one of the most anticipated games of 1999. Its development suffered numerous delays, with several features being cut before release. However, it was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics, despite some of the technical bugs in the game. The dark atmosphere, foreboding soundtrack, and slow paced gameplay of Tiberian Sun received a mixed reception from fans upon release, although have earned it a cult following since. Its story of a military-industrial complex preoccupied with [[terrorism]] rather than environmental failure has been hailed as a metaphor for modern times. \r\n\r\nSeveral additional features were added to the game with the Firestorm expansion pack, including new units and a multiplayer global war mode.

Other modes include a skirmish battle mode and multiplayer games.\r\n\r\nThe game received favorable reviews, and proved a commercial success following its launch, with a stand-alone expansion pack released a year later on March 24, 2008, titled Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":171103,"created_at":"2023-08-22T01:36:56.566-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-21T04:46:31.300-04:00","title":"command_&_conquer:_generals","body":"A real-time strategy video game developed by [[electronic_arts|EA Pacific]] and released in February 2003. \r\n\r\nIt is set in the near future, relative to the game's release date, using technology that is either existent, in development, or theorized. The game features a conflict between the [[global_liberation_army|Global Liberation Army]] (GLA), an organization resembling a [[terrorist]] group, and the superpowers of the [[China|People’s Republic of China]] (China) and the [[united_states|United States of America]] (USA). \r\n\r\nThe game operates in a similar manner to other titles in the [[Command and Conquer|Command & Conquer]] series, where players construct bases, train units, acquire resources on one of the game's maps to fund their operations, and then defeat their opponents by eliminating their bases and armies. It is the first Command & Conquer RTS game to use 3D graphics in-game. The game takes place in an entirely separate continuity that is completely unrelated to the [[command & conquer: red alert 2|Red Alert]] universe or the [[Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun|Tiberium]] universe.\r\n\r\nAn expansion pack titled [i]\"Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_&_Conquer:_Generals_%E2%80%93_Zero_Hour][/i] was released in September 2003, adding several new abilities and units to each side, and a new mode of play called Generals' Challenge, along with a lot more changes, new features and bug/glitch fixes.\r\n\r\nThe series has received controversy from media watchdogs due to its national stereotyping and the ability to play as a terrorist-like organization, particularly during the height of the \"War on Terror\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror. Longtime Command & Conquer fans also objected to the association of their franchise with a game that resembled other real-time strategy games more than traditional Command & Conquer gameplay. \r\n\r\nDespite this, the game received positive reviews from fans and critics for its solid and action-packed gameplay, as well as receiving praise for the humorous and memorable voicelines for many of its units. It has since gained a cult following, with fans of the series continuing to develop mods that change the gameplay significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. See Also\r\n* [[Command and Conquer]]\r\n\r\nh4.

Both he and [[Horikawa Kunihiro]] are personifications of swords that belonged to [[Hijikata Toshizou]] of the [[Shinsengumi]]. He was asked to be made after the Shinsengumi started to become well known, and Hijikata thus sought after a swordsmith from the Kanesada school, requesting that his new sword be similar to his [[wakizashi]] (Horikawa). This is likely the reason why Izumi-no-kami and Horikawa have the same hair and eye color. He is still around today, located in the Hijikata Toshizou Museum in his hometown of Hino, [[Tokyo (city)|]].\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\n[tn]See post #1934098 for base form.[/tn]\r\n\r\nHe has [[long hair|long]] [[black hair]] with part of it done in a [[side braid]], and [[blue eyes]]. He typically wears [[earrings]], [[Japanese clothes]], black [[fingerless gloves]], and a [[cape]] with the Shinsengumi's distinctive blue and white pattern. For his [[Izumi-no-kami Kanesada (Kiwame)|Kiwame]] form, he puts his hair up in a [[ponytail]] and wears a white [[headband]], a Shinsengumi [[haori]] and black [[knee boots]]. \r\n\r\nDespite looking like an adult, he is technically the youngest character in the game, being the most recently forged sword as he was made in 1867. Because of this, he often comes across as reckless and a bit overconfident, which is why Horikawa often has to assist him or reign him in. Much of his personality is also inspired by the real-life Hijikata.\r\n\r\nh4.

As many different Nerf guns utilise different types of ammunition, the term 'Nerf dart' specifically refers to small, cylindrical tubes topped with rubber ends that are designed to be a kid-friendly imitation of [[bullet|bullets]] for use in mock firefights.\r\n\r\nThe most universally recognised type of Nerf dart is the \"Elite Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dart], a category of Nerf dart that was first released in 2012 coinciding with the launch of the N-Strike Elite series of Nerf toy guns. The standard Elite Dart is recognised by its [[blue]] cylindrical body and [[orange]] rubber tip, which has a hole inside it, likely to prevent choking if it were to be consumed. \r\n\r\nThese Elite Darts were designed to be direct improvements to the previous 'Streamline Dart', with upgades to their range, aerodynamic stability, and general accuracy. However, they share largely the same flaws as their Streamline predecessor, primarily the hole in the front causing the air in front of the bullet, as it naturally encounters air resistance, to be dragged through the hollow body of the bullet, deforming and thus unbalancing the dart. \r\n\r\nHasbro continues to manufacture these darts in spite of this design flaw in order to assure the safety of children who may consume the bullet accidentally, as despite their resemblance to conventional bullets fired by conventional firearms, Nerf ammunition, like the rest of the brand, is designed for non-lethal play instead of live fire combat. As such, their efficiency in both killing and as a general projectile are not prioritised.\r\n\r\nThe universality of the Elite Dart's design has resulted in many color variants being produced for Nerf toy weapons outside the initial N-Strike Series, such as the \"GlowStrike Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/GlowStrike_Dart] (which would glow in the dark), the \"Message Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Message_Dart] (which was packaged with equipment that allowed for the writing of messages on the dart's body), and the \"Star Wars Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Dart] (a collaboration dart produced for the [[Star Wars]] crossover line which came in [[red]] and [[blue]] colors signifying allegience to the First Order and the Resistance respectively).","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":193724,"created_at":"2024-05-18T10:23:16.046-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-18T10:23:34.897-04:00","title":"wisps_(mint_fantome)","body":"The representation of [[Mint Fantome]]'s fans.

What defines a character?\r\n\r\nGenerally, it is self-evident who are characters and what aren't. For example, [[Edward Elric]], [[Pikachu]], and [[Simon (ttgl)|]] are obviously characters, while the [[philosopher's stone]], [[Ecruteak City]], and the [[core drill]] are not.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes it isn't as clear cut. While there is no official policy on what a character is, the unofficial rule of thumb seems to be: [b]If it talks, acts on its own, or is otherwise shown to be sentient in the source material (game, anime, manga, novel), it is a character.[/b]\r\n\r\nThus, something can be considered a character even if it is an object, for example [[Bardiche (nanoha)|]] or Plankton's computer wife [[Karen (spongebob_squarepants)|]].\r\n\r\nh5. What types of things SHOULD NOT be a character tag?\r\n\r\nLocations and non-[[mecha]] vehicles are not characters. (See forum #34022)\r\n\r\nSometimes, artists draw an object (computer, software, vehicle, food, etc.) as a humanoid. This is called a [[personification]]. However, the object is still not considered a character, so it should remain a general tag. If the personified version becomes a character in its own right, a separate character tag can be created for it. For example, [[strawberry]] is the food and [[strawberry-chan]] is the personification.\r\n\r\nh5. How to make a character tag.\r\n\r\nTo make a tag be a character tag, prefix it with \"character:\" or \"char:\". Remember to replace spaces with underscores (like_this).\r\n\r\nh6. Name and Name Order\r\n\r\nCharacter tags should be the same name and name order that are used in the original source material. For example, [[Kiyama Hiroto]], not \"Hiroto Kiyama\" or \"Xavier Foster\". If an alternate name, such as a nickname or a name from the English version, is widely used, you may \"request an alias\":[/bulk_update_requests/new] from that to the original language title.\r\n\r\nHowever, some copyrights are [b]exceptions[/b] to this rule. Characters from the following should be tagged with their [b]English-language names[/b] when possible:\r\n* [b][[Ace Attorney]] (Gyakuten Saiban)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Advance Wars]] (Famicom Wars)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Animal Crossing]] (Doubutsu no Mori)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Castlevania (series)|]] (Akumajou Dracula)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Final Fantasy]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Fire Emblem]][/b]\r\n** <tn>To be tagged with the names used in the North American localizations (preferably [i]Fire Emblem Heroes[/i]). See topic #16149.</tn>\r\n* [b][[Golden Sun]] (Ougon no Taiyou)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Granblue Fantasy]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Kid Icarus]] (Hikari Shinwa)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Mario (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Mega Man (series)|]] (Rockman)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Monster Hunter (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Pokemon]][/b] (human and creature)\r\n* [b][[Splatoon (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Tales of (series)|Tales of...]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Xenoblade Chronicles (series)|]][/b]\r\n\r\nh6. Follow [[howto:romanize]].\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure how to romanize the character's name, ask in a comment or on the forum.\r\n\r\nh6. Only one name?\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, characters should be tagged with their full name. However, some characters are only known by a single name (like [[Chen]]). Other times, their full name may be considered a spoiler. Usually these should be tagged with the single name, adding a _(series) qualifier if it is ambiguous. (See [[help:qualifiers]])\r\nIf only their surname is known (e.g. same as their spouse or children), or if the full name is not well-known, it may be appropriate to tag them Mr. or Mrs. Surname. (or Dr. or Professor, etc)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* [[asuna_(sao)]]\r\n* [[yamada_(b-gata_h-kei)]]\r\n* [[bobby_(fma)]]\r\n* [[yuki_(touhou)]]\r\n* [[mrs._bradley]]\r\n* [[mr._koiwai]]\r\n\r\nHowever, if a character is from a game which is self-titled (title comes from character's name, resulting in a [code]character_(series)[/code] copyright tags), it should be left off. Example:\r\n\r\n* [[Mario]] of [[Mario (Series)]]\r\n* [[Kirby]] of [[Kirby (Series)]]\r\n\r\nh6. No name!\r\n\r\nIf the character has no known name but is still recognizable in images (or if their name is a [[spoilers|spoiler]]), a succinct description can be used as a tag for them. If there is consensus among how fans of the series refer to them, use that. Add a _(series) qualifier if the tag may be ambiguous.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* [[idoko]]\r\n* [[idoko's_stepsister]]\r\n* [[giha_village_chief]]\r\n* [[nurse_(katawa_shoujo)]]\r\n* [[girl_with_bear_(madoka_magica)]]\r\n* [[lady_in_red_(ib)]]\r\n* [[mysterious_boy_(angel_beats!)]]\r\n* [[man_with_watch]]\r\n* [[kyon's sister]]\r\n* [[girl_from_the_illusionary_world]]\r\n* [[jyushimatsu's_girlfriend]]\r\n\r\nh6. Titles and honorifics\r\n\r\nGenerally, characters do not have honorifics or titles in their names, as the honorific changes depending on who is addressing the character. However, some characters have the honorific or title as a permanent part of their name such as [[Chouzetsusaikawa Tenshi-chan]] or [[Mr. C.B. (umamusume)|]] In these cases, keep the honorific or title intact. In cases where a character is frequently addressed by their title, a utility alias can be created to help find the character, such as the alias from Arthur Kirkland -> [[United Kingdom (Hetalia)]].\r\n\r\nh6. Alternate identities, [[genderswap]]s, and other derivatives\r\n\r\nIf a character has alternate identities or forms which are visually distinct, these are tagged as well. Use the official name, or if there is none, the agreed-upon fan referent. [b]Alternate forms may be [[spoilers|spoiler]], so be careful when tagging.[/b] Depending on the situation, the tag for the regular identity may be used with the alternate identity as well. Alternate identity tags may be character-type or general-type; again, it depends on the situation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* [[awakened_miki]]\r\n* [[sakura_miku]]\r\n* [[ex-keine]]\r\n* [[kyonko]]\r\n\r\nNot every genderswap gets their own character tag; only the ones that are popular enough to have established genderswap names.\r\n\r\nException is for younger or older versions of the character, these are covered by the regular character tag, plus whichever applicable age tags: [[aged down]], [[baby]], [[toddler]], [[child]], [[aged up]], [[old_woman]], [[old_man]], etc.\r\n\r\nh6. Cosplays - One character wearing another's costume\r\n\r\nAdd both characters tags (the cosplayer and character they're dressing as) and a third general *_(cosplay) tag for the costume. So [[yakumo ran|Ran]] wearing a Pikachu suit would need:\r\n\r\n* [[cosplay]]\r\n* [[yakumo_ran]]\r\n* [[pikachu_(cosplay)]]\r\n* [[pikachu]] \r\n\r\nThis can be accomplished by just tagging [[yakumo_ran]] and [[pikachu_(cosplay)]], as cosplay tags automatically imply both the character tag and the [[cosplay]] tag.\r\n(see forum #1261)","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":31879,"created_at":"2012-01-18T05:25:34.407-05:00","updated_at":"2024-05-16T20:07:39.636-04:00","title":"veranda","body":"A roofed, open gallery or [[porch]].\r\n\r\nThe traditional Japanese equivalent is the [i]engawa[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.

Sound effects are often skipped because they can be inferred from context, ambiguous, and are less critical to understanding. It's also common when a post's translation is taken from another, hard-translated source (such as a manga scanlation aggregator).\r\n\r\nSound effects can be translated in a number of ways. For example, ゴゴゴゴ could be translated as:\r\n\r\n* *rumbling* <tn>What the sound effect represents (a verb or an adjective)</tn>\r\n* gogogogo <tn>A romanization of the katakana that preserves the reading</tn>\r\n* brbrbrbr <tn>How the sound effect might be spoken in English</tn>\r\n\r\nYou can include more than one translation to help different kinds of readers.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that \"Japanese sound effects aren't always sounds\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sound_symbolism] and may represent non-auditory senses like \"damp\", \"stealthily\", \"foolishy\", \"plump\", and \"fluffy\".\r\n\r\nh1.
