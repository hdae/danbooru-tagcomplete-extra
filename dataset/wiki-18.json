The manga was first published in 1982 on [[Weekly Shounen Jump]].\r\n\r\nThe original anime adaptation created by [[Toei Animation]] in 1984 sparked a massive controversy due to the anime featured massive amount of violence (especially for its time when \"Adult content air time\" did not exist), most notably gore. leading to massive usage of censorship on the anime, and the creation of \"Adult content air time\", a slot of airing time on Television specifically for violent anime.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the series' extreme violence and masculine-heavy theme had later inspired other action shounen and seinen manga and anime, particularly during late 80s and 90s era. Notable examples were [[jojo_no_kimyou_na_bouken|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]], [[Grappler Baki]], [[Bastard!!]] [[Sun-Ken Rock]], [[Berserk]] and recently [[Chainsaw Man]] and [[Jujutsu Kaisen]].\r\n\r\nDue to the unique [[manly]] artstyle, heavely inspired by 80s Movies like [[Mad Max]] and [[Terminator]], the show is also frequently subjected to various [[parody]] comedy doujins that were usually revolved around turning various cute anime girl into a \"[[hara_tetsuo_(style)|K-style]]\" style macho women (mostly involves the character [[cosplay]] and attempt to roleplay as their respective character) for comedic effect.\r\n\r\nh5. Story (anime adaptation)\r\n\r\nNear the end of the 20th century, a nuclear war engulfed most of the Earth's surface, reducing most of the world into a vast desert wasteland. The survivors of mankind banded together in tribes in order to fight over the few supply of uncontaminated food and water still left in the world, with the strong often preying on the weak. [[Kenshiro]], the successor of the assassination art known as Hokuto Shinken, wanders the wasteland after being separated from his fiancee [[Yuria (Hokuto no Ken)|]] by his friend-turned-enemy [[Shin_(hokuto_no_ken)|Shin]]. Accompanied by two young children, [[Bat (Hokuto no Ken)|]] and [[Lin (hokuto no ken)|]], Ken becomes a savior to the weak and innocent from the various gangs and ruthless bandits threatening their survival. Throughout the course of his journey, Kenshiro encounters various formidable rivals and adversaries, ultimately culminating with Kenshiro's eldest adoptive brother [[Raoh (hokuto no ken)|]], an oppressive tyrant who challenges Ken for the right of the Hokuto Shinken succession.\r\n\r\nSeveral years afterward, Kenshiro reunites with the now grown Bat and Lynn in order to stand up against a corrupt Imperial Army. The three, with the help of other rebels, manage to expose a conspiracy within the Imperial Army to keep the Heavenly Empress ([spoiler]Lynn's estranged twin sister, Lui[/spoiler]) imprisoned. The Empress is saved, only for Lynn to be taken to the \"Land of Asura\", a country of warriors where only the mightiest survive. Kenshiro crosses to Asura in pursuit of her, only to find himself fighting against the three generals who rule over the land. [spoiler]Kenshiro finds himself fighting not only against his own blood brother Hyou, but also [[Kaioh (hokuto no ken)|Kaioh]], Raoh's own brother.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nh4.

Her spork may be depicted as a [[spoon]] by some artists, either deliberately or as a mistake.\r\n\r\nHer ability allows her to devour and absorb almost absolutely anything, turning it into her power. Unlike her fellow Animal Realm matriarchs, she and her organization prefer to avoid pointless conflict, and would rather recruit or forge a mutually-beneficial relationship with their enemies, with an all-out war being a last resort for them. Taking advantage of the events in <i>Wily Beast and Weakest Creature</i>, she went to the Former Hell of Blood Pools in order to monopolize the petroleum deposits there, containing the desires of long dead organic beings. \r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b> If you can't concretely identify the utensil she is wielding (even with the tags/title/commentary/parent-child posts/pools), just tag [[utensil]] instead.\r\n\r\nh4.

He chose not to interfere in his master's conflict with ancient humans even after it resulted in the splitting of the Omnipotent into two conflicting and opposed sides; the god of the skies and the god of the stars. The sky god wished to recreate the sky realm while the Astral god opted to leave and create an entirely new world based on the one they had left, neither paying attention to the fate of the Speaker. Still, he continued to await contact from his master so he might continue fulfilling his role as Speaker.

After all, it was not only the power of Supreme Primarch that saved the world but the combined strength of many different forces. He started to wonder if perhaps the world's current state was already perfect and no longer in need of evolution thanks to living creatures and their ability to support each other and compensate their own weaknesses. He confronted the Singularity with these mixed feelings in a dream. After reaffirming himself in his new stance, he left his role as observer and decided that it was fine to simply continue living on and to use his powers for the well-being of the skies. Aboard the Grandcypher alongside Singularity and their crew, he waits for the day when he can ask his master the true purpose behind himself, the world, and all living beings.

In almost every case, a Living Saint has been resurrected from the dead, sometimes multiple times. The belief among the faithful of the Imperial Creed is that these individuals are blessed by the Emperor Himself, and are resurrected by His will and grace to defend His servants.\r\n\r\nMost of the known Living Saints have been members of the Adepta Sororitas, particularly its Orders Militant, but several have also emerged from the ranks of the Astra Militarum.\r\n\r\nIn truth, it is clear that Living Saints draw their powers from the Warp much like the servants of Chaos, but are not necessarily psykers during their initial lifetimes. Instead, a Living Saint's faith in the God-Emperor is so great that it allows them to unconsciously draw upon the Warp to fuel supernatural abilities, including the ability to resurrect from death. \r\n\r\nhttps://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Living_Saint","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":39285,"created_at":"2012-10-21T21:27:22.502-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-28T21:07:12.528-05:00","title":"dreamcatcher","body":"In Native American culture, a handmade object based on a willow hoop, on which is woven a loose net or web.
