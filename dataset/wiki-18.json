Appearance\r\nHer base art portrays her with [[short hair|short]] [[pink hair]], [[dragon horns]], [[dragon tail]], and [[green eyes]], in line with her name (meaning \"prancing dragon\").\r\n\r\nHer outfit consists of a white [[midriff]] with [[white sailor collar]], a white [[military uniform]] coat with traditional [[long sleeves]], a red [[hakama short skirt]], [[rudder footwear]], and dragon scales-themed [[socks]]. Her rig consists of her real-life [[flight deck]] to her right and her bridge and three bow pieces on her left.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nIn real life, [i]Ryuujou[/i] was designed to exploit a loophole in the original Washington Naval Treaty that excluded carriers from total tonnage if they weighed 8,000 tons or less. To that end, she was given a slim cruiser hull, no armor, and a single hangar. However, the 1930 London Naval Treaty closed the loophole, while IJN planners insisted on doubling her air group so a second hangar was placed atop the original, leaving her as the only ship of her class and suffering from questionable seakeeping and stability. She was rebuilt after sustaining storm damage in 1935.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the war, she was the only carrier available to the IJN for Southeast Asian combat support operations (while the Kido Butai did provide support in the Dutch East Indies, they only did so when needed). Alongside [[Junyou (Azur Lane)|]], they participated in the Aleutians campaign before transferring to Guadalcanal. She was sunk by aircraft from [[Saratoga (Azur Lane)|]] in the battle of the Eastern Solomons in late August 1942.\r\n\r\nh4.

His name comes from the incident where a servant angered his owner and hid behind a table to no avail because Oda used Hasebe to slice through the table and kill that servant.

Artists tend to give him a comically serious personality who's utterly obsessed with pleasing the Saniwa (a trait that often comes into play in more comedic side works, such as [i]Hanamaru[/i] or the official Anthalogy; see Pool #11476 for this portrayal).
