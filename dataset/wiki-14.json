On 3 October 1993, a [[UH-60 Blackhawk]] [[helicopter]] operating in support of US forces raiding Somali militias was struck by a [[rpg (weapon)|RPG]] and crashed in the middle of the hostile city of Mogadishu. The next 24 hours saw the fiercest fighting America had experienced since the [[Vietnam War]], costing the lives of eighteen Americans from the task force, and one Malaysian and one Pakistani from the UN rescue force, with over 90 combined US and UN wounded. Estimates for Somali deaths range from 133 to over 700. One American pilot from the second downed [[helicopter]] was captured by Somali forces. The battle dealt the effective end of UN efforts to end Somalia's civil war, and would have a drastic effect on American foreign policy for the rest of the 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe story of the battle was told in a 1999 book by journalist Mark Bowden, titled [i]Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War[/i], which was then adapted into a movie by the same name in 2001 by director Ridley Scott. In addition, the 2003 video game [[delta force (video game)|Delta Force: Black Hawk Down]] depicts a fictionalized version of the Somali civil war, as is the same series' reboot campaign releasing in 2025.\r\n\r\nh4.

She was given away to the Matou family because the laws of the mage world prevented Tokiomi from training more than one of his daughters to carry on his family's tradition, and Tokiomi didn't want Sakura's potential to go to waste. However, [[Matou Zouken|Zouken]] is not really training her as a mage but instead putting her through hell. [[Matou Kariya]] made a deal with Zouken to win the Holy Grail in exchange for Sakura's freedom to return to the Tohsaka family, which he fails to do at the end of the series.\r\n\r\nIn [[Fate/Stay Night]], Sakura is [[Emiya Shirou|Shirou]]'s timid underclassman and [[Matou Shinji|Shinji]]'s adopted sister.

Though she is respectful of her brother and defends his misconduct, he is in turn an abusive jerk towards her.

She took the role of acting leader after Liliweiss's untimely death.\r\n\r\nDuring their battle for survival and the defense of the Ark, Dorothy was forced to euthanize her fellow Nikke and friend, [[Pinne (nikke)|]], when the latter became corrupted. This plunged Dorothy into spiraling depression, leading her to attempt suicide. However, the other members of the Goddess squad managed to stop her and confined her to prevent self-harm. In isolation, Dorothy suffered from hallucinations of Pinne, much to her squadmates' confusion.\r\n\r\nNot long after Pinne's death, the Central Government of the Ark betrayed the Goddess squad by sealing them outside. As a result, Dorothy was left to wander around the surface, becoming filled with bitterness and resentment towards the Ark, and had been planning long-term about her revenge before becoming the leader of Inherit.\r\n\r\nAs she was a former member of Goddess squad like the Pioneer squad members, Dorothy is named after a children's novel character instead of a Biblical figure.

Although the Carbine was the most-produced US small arm of WW2, it is a relatively rare sight in media, particularly in comparison to the far-less-common [[Thompson submachine gun]]. \r\n\r\nDistinguishing features of the Carbine are the two pins on the upper stock just forward of the bolt. World War Two-era Carbines had a clean barrel from the stock to the muzzle and simple flip-tab rear sights, though later versions added a [[bayonet]] lug and more advanced graduated rear sights. The standard feed system is a 15-round box [[magazine (weapon)|magazine]].\r\n\r\n* The M1A1 Carbine is the variant that features a metal side-[[folding stock]] and a pistol grip.\r\n* The [[M2 Carbine]] is the name given to Carbines made capable of firing on full-automatic.

Each post can have many [[help:tags|tags]], [[help:comments|comments]], [[help:notes|notes]], and a single [[help:artist commentary|artist commentary]]. Each post may also belong to multiple [[help:pools|pools]]. If you have an [[help:users|account]], you can also add a post to your [[help:favorites|favorites]] or [[help:favorite groups|favorite groups]].\r\n\r\nh4. Searching\r\n\r\nSearching for posts is straightforward. Simply enter the tags you want to search for, separating tags by spaces and words [i]within[/i] tags by underscores. For example, searching for {{blonde_hair blue_eyes}} will return every post that has both the [[blonde hair]] tag [b]and[/b] the [[blue eyes]] tag.\r\n\r\nBe aware that tags for characters and series are usually known by their original Japanese names, not their English names. For example, the tag on Danbooru for [i]The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya[/i] is [[Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]]. See [[help:tags]] for more information.\r\n\r\nDanbooru also offers many metatags that let you further refine your search. Metatags allow you to query on things like image width, height, score, uploader, upload date, and more. Consult the [[help:cheatsheet|cheat sheet]] for a complete list of what you can do.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that Members are limited to two tags per search. See [[help:users]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4. Tag List\r\n\r\nIn both the post listing page and on individual post pages you'll notice a list of tags with links next to them. Here's an explanation of what the links are:\r\n\r\n[b]?[/b]\r\n    This links to the wiki page for the tag. If the tag is an [[help:artists|artist]] type, then you'll be redirected to the artist page.\r\n\r\n[b]950[/b]\r\n    The number next to the tag represents how many posts there are. This isn't always the total number of posts for that tag. If you're searching for a combination of tags, this will be the number of posts that have the tag AND the current tag query. If you're not searching for anything, this will be the number of posts found within the last twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[b]Color[/b]\r\n    Some tag links may be colored green, purple, or red. Green means the tag represents a character. Purple means the tag represents a copyright (things like anime, manga, games, or novels). Red means the tag represents an [[help:artists|artist]].\r\n\r\nWhen you're not searching for a tag, by default the tag list will show the most popular tags within the last three days. When you are searching for tags, the tag list will show related tags, sorted by relevancy.\r\n\r\nh2#mode-menu. Mode Menu\r\n\r\n[[help:users|Gold and above users]] will notice a menu labeled \"Mode\" in the sidebar on the main listing page. This menu lets you make several changes without ever leaving the listing page. Simply select an option and whenever you click on a thumbnail, the action will be performed in the background.\r\n\r\n[b]View[/b]\r\n    This is the default mode. Whenever you click on a thumbnail, you'll go to that post.\r\n\r\n[b]Edit[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, an edit box will appear. Here you can easily change the post's tags from the listing page without opening the entire post.\r\n\r\n[b]Tag script[/b]\r\n    Write a tag script into the text box that appears, and it will be applied when you click on the thumbnail of a post. This allows you to quickly add or remove tags to many posts at once. See [[help:tag scripts]] for details on creating tag scripts.\r\n\r\n[b]Favorite[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, that post will be added to your list of [[help:favorites|favorites]].\r\n\r\n[b]Unfavorite[/b]\r\n    Whenever you click on a thumbnail, that post will be removed from your list of [[help:favorites|favorites]].\r\n\r\nh4. Borders\r\n\r\nIn the listing page, you will notice that some thumbnails have a border. The meaning of this border depends on the color.\r\n\r\n[b]Blue[/b]\r\n    The post is [[about:mod_queue|pending moderator approval]] or was [[about:mod_queue|flagged for deletion]].\r\n\r\n[b]Black[/b]\r\n    The post is [[about:mod_queue|deleted]].\r\n\r\n[b]Green[/b]\r\n    The post has [[help:post relationships|child posts]].\r\n\r\n[b]Yellow[/b]\r\n    The post has a [[help:post relationships|parent]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":222253,"created_at":"2025-01-19T12:30:13.711-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-19T12:32:15.140-05:00","title":"dogenzaka_runa","body":"A character in the mobile game Persona 5: The Phantom X.

These adventures were continued by the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. The original series were influential in both the west and the east. In Japan it inspired the famous [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]] classic anime series. \r\n\r\nFour more television series were eventually produced, based in the same universe but following other characters: [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]], following the crew of a new Starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] and [[Star Trek: Voyager]], set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise, set before the original series, in the early days of human interstellar travel. \r\n\r\nFour additional feature films were produced, following the crew of The Next Generation, and most recently a 2009 movie reboot of the franchise featuring the young crew of the original Enterprise set in an [[star trek: kelvin timeline|alternate timeline]]. \r\n\r\nThe newest Star Trek television revival, beginning in 2017, includes the series [[Star Trek: Discovery]], [[Star Trek: Picard|Picard]], Short Treks, [[Star Trek: Lower Decks|Lower Decks]], Prodigy, and [[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds|Strange New Worlds]], streaming on digital platforms.\r\n\r\nThe franchise also includes dozens of computer and video games, hundreds of novels, as well as a themed attraction in Las Vegas (closed in September 2008). Beginning with the original television series and continuing with the subsequent films and series, the franchise has created a cult phenomenon and has spawned many pop culture references.\r\nh4.

In a career spanning more than fifty years, he was awarded numerous accolades, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 and an Honorary Academy Award in 2019. Often described as a \"visionary\", Lynch was considered one of the most important filmmakers of his era.\r\n\r\nLynch studied painting before he began making short films in the late 1960s. His first feature-length film was the independent surrealist film [[Eraserhead]] (1977), which saw success as a midnight movie. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for the biographical drama The Elephant Man (1980), the neo-noir thriller Blue Velvet (1986), and the surrealist mystery Mulholland Drive (2001). His romantic crime drama Wild at Heart (1990) won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He also directed [[Dune (1984 movie)|the 1984 adaptation of Dune]], the surrealist neo-noir Lost Highway (1997), the biographical drama The Straight Story (1999), and the experimental film Inland Empire (2006).\r\n\r\nLynch and Mark Frost created the ABC series [[Twin Peaks]] (1990–91), for which he was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.

Known as the NX during development. The first production model went on sale on March 3rd, 2017. \r\n\r\nThe Nintendo Switch has two dedicated [[game controller]]s (one for each hand) called [[Joy-Con]]s. These can be attached to and removed from the console at will, essentially making it a hybrid home/handheld platform.\r\n\r\nA smaller version, the [[nintendo switch lite|Switch Lite]], was revealed July 10th, 2019, built strictly for handheld gaming. The Lite has no detachable Joy-Cons; the controllers are hard-built into the console. It also has no HDMI output so cannot be connected to a TV like the original model Switch can. \r\n\r\nThe platform has enjoyed a positive reception and high sales numbers in the years since its release. In addition to carrying many popular flagship titles like [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]] and [[Super Mario Odyssey]], the Switch has also become a welcoming home for many older games from last-gen systems. This led the Switch to be the [i]de facto[/i] portable way to play popular older titles like [[Diablo 3]], [[Dark Souls I]] and [[Castle Crashers]] which had previously only been playable on non-portable platforms. As of early 2023, the combined Switch product line is one of the best-selling platforms in Nintendo's entire history, outselling both the [[Wii]] and the [[Game Boy]] and now second only to the [[Nintendo DS]].\r\n\r\nFor tagging purposes, if the Switch has its Joy-Cons detached (or is being controlled by other compatible controllers), tag it as a [[game console]] (post #3259420, post #3528468). If the Switch has at least one Joy-Con connected or the console itself is the Lite, tag it as a [[handheld game console]] (post #3471232, post #3470179).\r\n\r\nh4.
