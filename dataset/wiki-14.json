The wrapping is a visible cue as to their general level of bad-assery.\r\n\r\nA [[tomboy]]ish girl may wear a [[chest sarashi]] to bind and/or flatten her breasts, especially if she is trying to pass as male. Alternatively, it may be worn like a [[tube top]] to accentuate the breasts in a very nontraditional way, leaving the [[midriff]] bare. This sarashi style is especially seen on [[kendo]] girls and other fighters. If it's especially revealing then it may become a [[budget sarashi]]. \r\n\r\nh4.

The kyuu guntou were used from 1875 until 1934.  Their production was not standardized, with different craftsmen producing them.  Many styles closely resembled European and American [[saber (weapon)|sabres]] of the time.  The shin guntou were used from 1935 until 1945.  Most of these were produced in the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal and were based on traditional slung [[tachi (weapon)|]] of the Kamakura Period (1185–1332).\r\n\r\nThese swords were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]].

His first G1 win was at the [[2021]] Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes. He would later become famous as the winner of the [[2022]] Japanese Derby ([[Tokyo Yushun]]), defeating [[Equinox (racehorse)|]], who would finally flourish at the 2022 Autumn Tenno-sho and dominate the field onwards. After a failed bet at l'Arc, a win at the Kyoto Kinen and having his main jockey (the legendary [[Take Yutaka]]) incapacitated during his rematches with Equinox, Do Deuce would finally claim his third G1 win at the [[2023]] [[Arima Kinen]], after Equinox's retirement and with Take Yutaka. He would later claim his fourth G1 at the [[2024]] [[Tenno Sho|Autumn Tenno Sho]], making him the first colt in history to have JRA G1 victories every year from age 2 to age 5. Among the fillies, only [[Mejiro Dober (racehorse)|]], [[Vodka (racehorse)|]] and [[Buena Vista (racehorse)|]] did the same. Not long after, he claimed his fifth G1 at the 2024 [[Japan Cup]], edging out [[Shin Emperor (Racehorse)|]] and [[Durezza (Racehorse)|]] (who finished in dead heat) by a neck. Unfortunately, he was scratched from the 2024 Arima Kinen due to lameness on one of his legs at a poor time and retired to stud without ceremony (Arima Kinen was to be his final race anyway). Interestingly, \"he ended up as a neighbor to his rival\":[/posts/8660742].\r\n\r\nHe is also infamous for being a large eater, something often shown when he is personified as a [[Umamusume]] [[horse girl]]. This is more salient due to his jockey comparing him to [[Special Week (racehorse)|]] on how they look like ([[Special Week (umamusume)|]] is also a large eater in Umamusume), even leading people to call him the Supreme Commander of the Reiwa era due to his performances.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ドウデュース","おドウさん","胜局在望"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":254786,"created_at":"2025-08-17T16:47:39.398-04:00","updated_at":"2025-08-17T16:47:39.398-04:00","title":"danon_scorpion_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Lord Kanaloa (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[King Kamehameha (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Lexie Lou (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Sligo Bay (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ダノンスコーピオン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":196538,"created_at":"2024-06-16T07:41:23.786-04:00","updated_at":"2025-08-17T16:46:44.986-04:00","title":"deep_sky_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Agnes Tachyon (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Sunday Silence (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Abi (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Chief's Crown (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ディープスカイ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":218349,"created_at":"2024-12-08T14:53:15.792-05:00","updated_at":"2025-08-17T16:46:22.807-04:00","title":"clementia_(arknights)","body":"An NPC in [[Arknights]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["克莱门莎","クレメンティア"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":169309,"created_at":"2023-07-24T12:35:34.909-04:00","updated_at":"2025-08-17T16:44:55.854-04:00","title":"dream_journey_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Stay Gold (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Sunday Silence (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Oriental Art (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Mejiro McQueen (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ドリームジャーニー","ドリジャ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":189676,"created_at":"2024-04-14T04:25:32.477-04:00","updated_at":"2025-08-17T16:44:03.793-04:00","title":"durezza_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Duramente (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[King Kamehameha (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[More Than Sacred (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[More Than Ready (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ドゥレッツァ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184194,"created_at":"2024-02-09T20:42:29.202-05:00","updated_at":"2025-08-17T16:41:59.761-04:00","title":"epiphaneia_(racehorse)","body":"[tn]Named after the day of the Epiphany.

He finished his streak by shattering the race record (and the world record on 2000m turf) at the 2023 Autumn Tenno-sho and dominating a very stacked 2023 Japan Cup. He was retired to stud afterwards, citing he would not have been ready in time for the Arima Kinen.\r\n\r\nHe is Kitasan Black's first G1-winning progeny and proved himself to be not only one of the best racehorses of his generation but also becoming the best rated racehorse in the world. His victory at the 2023 Japan Cup made him Japan's greatest earning racehorse (a reign that didn't last long due to [[Ushba Tesoro (racehorse)|]]'s repeated appearances in the Dubai World Cup and the Saudi Cup)  and, had he continued, he would have been well on his way to become Japan's first 7 G1 winner on turf with [b]no[/b] classic race wins.\r\n\r\nIn the context of [[Umamusume]], as the son of [[Kitasan Black (umamusume)|]], most fan designs portray him in some form of [[japanese clothes|Japanese-style outfit]], often with a Sun & Moon motif with a red and blue color scheme that references the [[racing colors]] of Silk Racing, Equinox's owner. He is also depicted together with [[King Halo (umamusume)|]] and/or [[Sakura Bakushin O (umamusume)|]] on some occasions.\r\n\r\nh4.

Eric was inspired to create Slender Man primarily by Stephen King's [[The Mist (stephen king)|]], Zach Parsons' [i]That Insidious Beast[/i], works of [[H P Lovecraft]] and [[shadow people]].\r\n\r\nHe quickly went viral, especially after the success of the derivative [[Marble Hornets]] web series, spawning numerous works of fanart, cosplay, other Creepypastas and even received his own mythos. Slender Man has also been adapted into various [[video game]]s, short films and movies and has arguably become the most famous Creepypasta of all time.\r\n\r\nSlender Man is depicted as a very [[tall male|tall]], [[faceless]] man wearing a [[black suit]] and [[necktie]]. He has [[white skin]] and occasionally has [[tentacles]] protruding from his back. Stories of Slender Man often feature him [[stalking]], [[kidnapping]] or traumatizing people, particularly [[child|children]]. He is commonly associated with the [[forest]] or [[abandoned]] places and has the ability to [[teleportation|teleport]]. People who encounter Slender Man may also become afflicted with a sickness known as the [i]Slender Sickness[/i], which manifests with various symptoms.\r\n\r\nh4.
