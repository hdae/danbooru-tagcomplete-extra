He was made to oversee evolution by an [[lucilius_(granblue_fantasy)|Astral researcher]] who had a keen interest in the subject. Bequeathed with ultimate power by the Astrals, he strives to protect the people of the Sky Realm. Even now, his eyes—melancholic and unsuited to an ultimate weapon—scan the blue horizon, in search of anything that might disturb the progress of the skies.

In almost every case, a Living Saint has been resurrected from the dead, sometimes multiple times. The belief among the faithful of the Imperial Creed is that these individuals are blessed by the Emperor Himself, and are resurrected by His will and grace to defend His servants.\r\n\r\nMost of the known Living Saints have been members of the Adepta Sororitas, particularly its Orders Militant, but several have also emerged from the ranks of the Astra Militarum.\r\n\r\nIn truth, it is clear that Living Saints draw their powers from the Warp much like the servants of Chaos, but are not necessarily psykers during their initial lifetimes. Instead, a Living Saint's faith in the God-Emperor is so great that it allows them to unconsciously draw upon the Warp to fuel supernatural abilities, including the ability to resurrect from death. \r\n\r\nhttps://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Living_Saint","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":39285,"created_at":"2012-10-21T21:27:22.502-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-28T21:07:12.528-05:00","title":"dreamcatcher","body":"In Native American culture, a handmade object based on a willow hoop, on which is woven a loose net or web.

[[Japan]]ese hobbyist magazine [[Model Graphix]], with whom Gundam Sentinel was co-planned, reinvented the project as a photo-novel and serialized the story in monthly installments.

Also, Gundam Sentinel is the only Gundam property that is not fully owned by Sunrise and Bandai. Due to their involvement in pre-production, Model Graphix holds a copyright claim on the series.
