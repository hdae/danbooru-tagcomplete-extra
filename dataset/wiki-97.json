Some members of the Chinese diaspora (i.e. Overseas Chinese) in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines (and also some older members of the Chinese communities in San Francisco, Los Angeles and NYC) may also use a form of Minnan as their mother tongue.\r\n\r\nThe term [i]Minnan[/i] is generally used to refer to Quanzhang and Zhangzhou variants of Minnan, and descendants thereof. Minnan can also technically refer to other varieties of Southern Min (e.g. Teochew (Chaozhou)), but this use will be excluded for the purposes of this wiki (and tagging on Danbooru).\r\n\r\nSpeakers of Minnan often have their own preferred way to refer to it: this includes Fujianhua, Fujianese, Fukien, Taigi, Holo, Hokkien, etc. The choice of which term to use can be fraught with... [i]political issues[/i], and as such \"Minnan\" is frequently used as a more neutral term that most speakers can understand as referring to the Quanzhang and Zhangzhou variants of Minnan (and descendants).\r\n\r\nFor Danbooru purposes (i.e. considering the demographics of the artists whose works are likely to be uploaded by users), most examples of Minnan text are likely to be in a Taiwanese variant of Minnan. These will usually be written in [[Traditional Chinese Text|Traditional Chinese]] characters (with occasional [[bopomofo_text]]), and mixed in with (sometimes accented) Mandarin Chinese (also written in Traditional Chinese). Minnan written in this way makes frequent use of Chinese characters chosen only for their phonetic values to approximate the pronunciations of Minnan, or to act as euphenisms.\r\n\r\nMainland Chinese artists who write in Minnan are also likely to mix Minnan with Mandarin Chinese (and employ similar euphemisms), but the text will be written in Simplified Chinese characters instead.\r\n\r\nArtists from Singapore and Malaysia tend to write in English, but some (particularly those of Chinese descent) may also insert certain Minnan phrases, written using the Latin alphabet. These tend to be profanity. Minnan is... well-known for having a rich vocabulary of colorful phrases.\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n* The above article has been written carefully in a certain way to avoid triggering political sensibilities. This may have resulted in the article using language that is less clear than ideal.\r\n** In particular, usage of the... 'D' and 'L' words are avoided.\r\n** The article (and tag) also uses the term Minnan, a more neutral term.\r\n** As such, be careful if one chooses to rewrite or edit this wiki.\r\n\r\nh4. Notable artists\r\n* [[Hi Ye]]\r\n** Taiwanese artist.\r\n** Character speech in comics are usually written in Mandarin Chinese (using Traditional Chinese characters). \r\n** Characters may sometimes switch to accented Mandarin or Minnan in more emotional moments.\r\n** This distinction is lost in the Japanese translations of the comics.\r\n\r\n* [[Guin Guin]]\r\n** Malaysian artist.\r\n** Character speech in comics are usually written in English.\r\n** Characters (particularly those of implied Chinese descent) may sometimes insert Minnan phrases (written using the Latin alphabet) in more emotional moments.\r\n\r\nh4. Notable examples\r\n* Post #4451091\r\n** All the dialogue is in Minnan. Only exception being the artist's notes.\r\n** Features some of the more colorful phrases.\r\n\r\n* Post #4586418\r\n** Entire page is in Minnan. Other than signboard and Japanese SFX.\r\n\r\nh4.

The game was released in November 2008 and is the fifth installment in the [[Call of Duty]] franchise. World at War is set during [[World War II]] and features both single-player and multiplayer modes.\r\n\r\nThe single-player campaign mostly follows the perspectives of two different Allied soldiers: Private Miller of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and Private Dimitri Petrenko of the [[Soviet Army]]. The game's story takes place in the Pacific and Eastern Front theaters of World War II, with players fighting against Japanese and German forces.\r\n\r\nIt was also the first game to introduce the [[zombie|Zombies]] gamemode, formerly known as Nazi Zombies during the game's lifespan.\r\n\r\nWorld at War was generally well-received by critics and fans, with many praising the game's gritty depiction of World War II and its intense gameplay. \r\n\r\nh4.
