The group emerged in the late 1980s and is often credited with popularizing gangsta rap, a subgenre of hip-hop characterized by its gritty and often explicit lyrics that depicted the realities of urban life, especially within African-American communities.\r\n\r\nThe most notable members of N.W.A included [i]\"Eazy-E\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazy-E[/i], [i]\"Dr. Dre\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre[/i], [i]\"Ice Cube\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube[/i], [i]\"MC Ren\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Ren[/i], and [i]\"DJ Yella\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Yella[/i]. The group's music was known for its explicit content, raw social commentary, and unapologetic portrayal of life in Compton.\r\n\r\nTheir debut album, '[[Straight Outta Compton]],' released in 1988, is one of the most significant albums in hip-hop history. The album featured tracks like  [i]\"'Fuck tha Police'\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_tha_Police[/i] that addressed issues of [[police]] brutality and racial profiling. The album's controversial content led to it being banned by many radio stations and retailers, but it also gained a strong underground following, spreading through word-of-mouth.\r\n\r\nWhile N.W.A disbanded in the early 1990s due to internal conflicts and creative differences, their legacy remains influential in hip-hop and popular culture. The group's members also went on to have successful solo careers in music, film, and other entertainment industries. \r\n\r\nThe group's story was depicted in the 2015 biographical film [i]\"'Straight Outta Compton'\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Outta_Compton_(film)[/i]\r\n\r\nh4.

The most common shape of the insignia is that of a shield, but the air force uses a round version on their vehicles, in which case there is a border in the same colour as the crowns. In its base form, the crowns are yellow on a blue fill. On military vehicles colourless versions are often used, with black (or dark grey) crowns and border with no fill, which is used on bright surfaces, or a white fill with black or transparent crowns and no border, used on darker surfaces. Very old army vehicles can be seen in pictures and museums painted with a rectangular version of the insignia in the latter colour scheme.

During the Clone Wars, Bossk worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned [[Boba Fett]]. Their scheme to kill Fett's hated enemy, the Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]], resulted in Fett and Bossk's arrest. \r\nAfter the rise of the Empire, Bossk continued to be one of the biggest names in the bounty hunting business despite eventually drifting apart from Fett and working mostly solo. Bossk also took part in hunting Wookiees that were natural enemies of his species, particularly growing a distaste for the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]] and his partner, the human [[Han Solo]]. Despite just having finished a mission where his last surviving sibling, his sister Doshanalawook, made him swear to stop hunting Wookiees, Bossk was called upon by [[Darth Vader]] to find and capture Solo, Chewbacca, and their ship, the [[Millennium Falcon]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":209527,"created_at":"2024-09-22T22:56:24.869-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-22T23:15:37.573-04:00","title":"tessa_(kipteitei)","body":"Main Character from [[kipteitei|KipTeiTei’s]] comic “One Serving Choice” and [[aika_(kipteitei)|Aika’s]] rival.\r\n\r\nHer full name is Tessa Tienai. \r\nShe’s a student at Amiya City Community College, where she meets [[saiya_(kipteitei)|Saiya Taiai]] and [[aika_(kipteitei)|Aika Eiai]].\r\nIn addition to being a student, she is also a popular streamer under the pseudonym “Tessakitz”.\r\n\r\nShe has [[long_hair|Long]] [[pink_hair|Pink Hair]], [[large_breasts|Large Breasts]], and typically wears a [[black_choker|Black Choker]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51205,"created_at":"2013-12-22T20:53:52.948-05:00","updated_at":"2024-09-22T23:11:40.592-04:00","title":"black_border","body":"An image with a black [[border]] along all four sides.\r\n\r\nSee [[letterboxed]] for when the image has black bars along the top and bottom sides.

Recently, race queens in less revealing outfits have also become more common, primarily in regions outside of Japan that still employ them - their outfits will usually consist of form-fitting [[dress]]es or [[bodysuit]]s instead. \r\n\r\nh4.
