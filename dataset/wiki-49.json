Emerging after the [[October Revolution]], the White Army was composed of monarchists, conservatives, liberals, and other factions united by their opposition to the Bolsheviks. Unlike their unified opponents, the Whites lacked a single cohesive ideology or leadership, which contributed to their eventual defeat.\r\n\r\nThe White Movement began forming in 1917 as resistance to the Bolshevik seizure of power. Key leaders included Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]], General [[Anton Denikin]], and General [[Pyotr Wrangel]]. Operating across vast regions like Siberia, South Russia, and the Far East, the Whites received support from foreign powers such as the Allied Intervention forces (e.g., Britain, France, and the United States). Despite early successes, internal divisions, corruption, and lack of popular support led to their collapse by 1923.\r\n\r\nh4. Symbolism\r\n\r\nThe term \"White\" contrasts with the \"Red\" of the Bolsheviks, drawing from historical Russian symbolism where white represented purity and loyalty to the Tsar. The Whites often used the double-headed eagle and the tricolor flag (white, blue, red) of the Russian Empire as their emblems.\r\n\r\nh4.

Most styles have a “y” shape collar, but there are also styles with a rounded collar.\r\n\r\nThere are several styles that are at times mistaken for kimono (most notably [[ruqun]]). You can typically distinguish between them based on the hairstyle and headwear. Males' hair may be pulled back into a simple ponytail or bun or held by a coronet. Emperors or princes may wear [[mian guan]]. If nothing else, [[huadian]] (forehead mark), or the [[tuanshan|circular fan]] is an easy distinguishing mark. \r\n\r\nHanfu differs from [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] era clothing. Hanfu specifically refers to clothing worn during dynasties wherein the ruling class was made up of the majority Chinese ethnic group, the Han. The Qing Dynasty was ruled by the [[Manchu clothes|Manchu]] ethnic minority. The frog button and mandarin collar style clothes, often simply refered to as Chinese clothes, are not Hanfu, as they are not Han clothing, but in fact Manchu. This goes too for other ethnic minority clothing in china, such as [[Miao clothes]] or [[Uygur clothes]]. These fall under the umbrella of [[Chinese clothes]], along with hanfu. \r\n\r\nh4.

He was found and adopted by a man named [[Gouken]] who raised Ryu in his secluded dojo and trained Ryu in the ways of his martial arts. Shortly afterwards, Gouken would later train his best friend's spoiled son, [[Ken Masters]]. Ken served not only as a sparring partner, but also gave Ryu a friend in the form of a boy his own age.\r\n\r\nRyu looked up to Gouken as a father figure, and regards Ken as his best friend and surrogate brother, a relationship which remains to this day. When Ryu was 23 years old, Gouken believed that Ryu was ready to travel the world in order to test and hone his martial skills against the best fighters from around the world.

Originated from a fanart by [[Oshiruko (oshiruco 212048)|]] posted on the end of October 2021, which was later used by Marine herself for the use in her \"sin confessions\" stream. A [[revealing clothes|skimpy]] version of the costume also briefly appeared in her first confession stream.\r\n\r\nThe costume consists of a dark blue [[nun]] habit with white double triangular [[breast curtain]]s and a dark blue [[pelvic curtain]]. There are two \"skimpy\" versions of the outfit, one with the inner garments removed (including [[no bra|bra]] and [[no panties|panties]]) revealing the wearer's [[underboob]] and only has the aforementioned curtains to cover their private parts. The other \"skimpy\" version swaps the long pelvic curtain for an even shorter one covering the crotch, leaving the [[midriff]] exposed. On December 2022, a revised version of the original costume was revealed. This version of the costume differs by using the same hairstyle of her [[houshou marine (marching band)|band costume]] and the addition of a suggestive [[underboob cutout]] on the costume.\r\n \r\nWhile this costume is technically unofficial (as it never received an official model for obvious reasons), it has gained notoriety within and out of the Hololive fanbase for its frequent usage by Marine herself, which resulted in it gaining the status of a [[meme attire]].\r\n\r\nThis tag is applicable to any posts that:\r\n* Features Marine herself wearing any variant of the outfit or derivative of it, and not a generic [[nun]] outfit.\r\n* Has other character(s) wearing any variant of the outfit or derivative of it.

He went to live with his uncle and aunt; Ben and May Parker, in Forest Hills, [[New York City]]. Parker was extremely bright and became a high honors student at Midtown High School. Parker's shyness and scholastic interest often made him a social outcast. \r\n\r\nWhile attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation, Peter was bitten by a spider which had been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration. Making his way home afterwards, Peter discovered he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls; spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, he was given his own [[tokusatsu]] [[spider-man (toei)|series]] in Japan where he had a [[mecha]] ([[Leopardon]]).\r\n\r\nOn [[Nijiura]], he shares a flat with [[Astaroth (Shinrabanshou)]], [[WE-tan]], and [[Yamada-san]].\r\n\r\nh4.
