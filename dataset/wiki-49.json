It serves as a symbol of the country's unity, independence, and democratic ideals. \r\n\r\nThe design of the American flag consists of 13 horizontal stripes alternating between red and white, representing the original 13 colonies that declared independence from [[united_kingdom|British]] rule. In the top left corner, commonly referred to as the canton, there is a blue rectangle containing 50 white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine rows. These stars represent the 50 states of the United States. The design of the flag has evolved over time as new states joined the Union. The current version with 50 stars became official on July 4, 1960, after [[Hawaii]] became the 50th state.\r\n\r\nThe colors of the American flag also hold symbolic meaning. Red represents valor and bravery, white signifies purity and innocence, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe American flag is widely recognized and displayed in various contexts, including government buildings, schools, homes, and during public events and holidays such as Independence Day ([[fourth_of_july|July 4th]]). It is treated with respect and reverence, and there are guidelines and protocols for its proper handling, folding, and display.\r\n\r\nFor images that only show patterns or other symbols representing the United States rather than the flag itself, use the [[United States]] tag.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her clothes tend to be very frilly and covered in flower motifs. She's from a wealthy upbringing.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Momoka is a mature girl who appears to have a lady-like aura about her. While she often tries to act older than she is, Momoka still is a young girl at heart and is susceptible to things girls her age enjoy. She was scouted by considering herself the prize in the Production Match Festival. She regularly holds tea parties with the younger idols, and takes them very seriously. Her favorite tea seems to be “Rose Hip Tea”, although she can occasionally be distracted from it via the antics of her guests.\r\n\r\nMomoka found a friend in [[Umeki Otoha]], as they both shared a similar demeanor. She appears to enjoy teasing [[Kamiya Nao]], as she notes Nao chooses her clothes and costumes with the Producer in mind. Momoka also really likes the glasses [[Kamijo Haruna]] gave her, and enjoys selecting kimonos with friends. She holds the Producer in very high regard and shows that she will put herself on the line in order to show him that she cares about him.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 8th CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Tachibana Arisu]], [[Ichinose Shiki]], [[Katagiri Sanae]], and [[Shiomi Syuko]].\r\n\r\nVoiced by [[Terui Haruka]].\r\n\r\nh4.
