The bill is long, thin and hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes. Some Southern Hemisphere species are black and white, and a few are quite colorful. Many species have areas of bare skin on the face which can be bright blue, orange, red, yellow or a combination of these. \r\n\r\nAll species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface. They are excellent divers, and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings. Some species have been measured to dive 150'.\r\n\r\nAfter diving, they often take a perch and spread their wings to dry out. This pose is frequently depicted in art.\r\n\r\nThe Pokémon [[Cramorant]] almost certainly takes its name and design from a cormorant.\r\n\r\nh4. Cormorants in Fishing Culture & Japan\r\n\r\nHumans have used cormorants' fishing skills in various places in the world. Archaeological evidence suggests that cormorant fishing was practiced in Ancient Egypt, Peru, Korea and India, but the strongest tradition has remained in China and Japan. \r\n\r\nIn Japan, cormorant fishing is called ukai (鵜飼). Traditional forms of ukai can be seen on the Nagara River in the city of Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, where cormorant fishing has continued uninterrupted for 1300 years, or in the city of Inuyama, Aichi. In Gifu, the Japanese cormorant is used, while Chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants. In Europe, a similar practice was used in the region of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nIn a common technique, a snare is tied near the base of the bird's throat, which allows the bird only to swallow small fish. When the bird captures and tries to swallow a large fish, the fish is caught in the bird's throat. When the bird returns to the fisherman's raft, the fisherman helps the bird to remove the fish from its throat. The method is not as common today, since more efficient methods of catching fish have been developed, but it continues to exist as a cultural tradition.\r\n\r\nh4.

Biography\r\n\r\nFormerly a cosplayer and model, and infamously a retired sex worker who dabbled in escorting, a minor porn stint, and most well known of all, camshows.\r\n\r\nShe is a slender and dark haired woman who has appeared in both long and short hair, but usually styles her hair in a style very similar to Ghost in the Shell's Kusanagi Motoko. This look is also the basis of her animated avatar that she uses on her Youtube channel. She was born on March 7, 1993 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Currently residing in Las Vegas.\r\n\r\nHer videos are primarily video game focused. Her favorite video game genres are survival horror, hack and slash action, and RPGs. She is most known for her extended retrospective/reviews of various video games, and her calm narration style. While she has shown her face many times in other places, her Youtube videos mostly have her anime avatar appear on screen in place of her.\r\n\r\nOnce had a cosplay Patreon that was closed in 2018 which included lewd shoots. Archives exist online.\r\n\r\nShe retired the Sue Lightning name in 2017, wishing to move on from the negative experiences she had as a sex worker, never liking it and only doing so due to peer pressure and current situations she was in at the time.\r\n\r\nh4.

Some mopeds have a step-through design (post #1132037) while others use a conventional motorcycle frame (post #689998). At the lighter end of the scale, there is some overlap between mopeds and motorized [[bicycle|bicycles]].\r\n\r\nSome regional governments classify motor scooters as mopeds based on factors such as engine displacement or speed. As these rules vary between jurisdictions and vehicle performance can not always be ascertained based on artwork, two-wheeled motor vehicles with a step-through design but without pedals should always be tagged [[scooter]] instead.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[motorcycle]]\r\n** [[minibike]]\r\n* [[List of ground vehicles]]\r\n\r\nh4.External links\r\n* \"Wikipedia article\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":108929,"created_at":"2019-10-17T11:03:36.446-04:00","updated_at":"2019-10-17T11:03:36.446-04:00","title":"carol_(sora_no_method)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キャロル(天体のメソッド)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":48194,"created_at":"2013-08-18T09:01:55.229-04:00","updated_at":"2019-10-17T04:59:15.871-04:00","title":"hitsugi_no_chaika","body":"A 12 volume light novel series by Sakaki Ichirou with art by [[Namaniku ATK]] which was published from 2010-2015.
