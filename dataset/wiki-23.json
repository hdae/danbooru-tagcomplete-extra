[i][[miko|Priestesses]] of the Godless Month[/i]) is a manga series created by the duo [[Kaishaku]]. The series was serialized in fourteen chapters by [i]Kadokawa Shoten[/i] and in [i]Shounen Ace[/i] in 2004 and 2005, and collected in two bound volumes. The series was adapted as an anime television series broadcast in 12 episodes on [i]TNK[/i] between October and December 2004. A drama CD was released on November 25, 2004 by [i]Geneon[/i] based on the anime version.\r\n\r\nThe series centers on the [[yuri]] relationship of the two main characters, [[kurusugawa_himeko|Himeko]] and [[himemiya_chikane|Chikane]], with elements of [[magical girl]] and [[mecha]] themes helping to carry the plot. An anime series that includes several characters similar to those of [i]Kannazuki no Miko[/i] called [i][[Kyoushirou to Towa no Sora]][/i] aired in Japan between January and March 2007.\r\n\r\nBecause it was one of the first yuri romances in an anime that was played as a straight romance, it's become iconic for yuri romance, especially its ED artwork, featuring the memetic [[miko embrace]].  (The pose is essentially synonymous with yuri.)\r\n\r\nThe manga and anime were originally released in English under the original Japanese title by Tokyopop and Geneon USA respectively. After Geneon USA's shutdown, distribution rights for the anime were transferred to Sentai Filmworks, who now distribute the series under the English title [b]Destiny of the Shrine Maiden[/b].\r\n\r\nh4.

At the tender age of twenty-three, “Yuko” was promoted from Lieutenant (OF-2) to Commodore (OF-6) as the solution the Wisdom Cube Affinity Project – a confidential research endeavour which aimed to seek exceptionally competent Kansen commanders, by virtue of their inherent ‘match’ with shipgirls.\r\nIn September 2019, an attack on Port Pacific (modern day Pearl Harbour) by the Sakura Empire mobilized Azur Lane. Thereafter, a bitter eighteen-month conflict with the powerful island nation began. Yuko’s prodigous handling of the ensuing conflict, deployment of strategy, and peerless care for his Kansen subordinates catapulted her through the flag officer ranks as Port Pacific stymied the Sakura Empire’s ambitions. Due to her unprecedented ascent through the ranks – and by virtue of her given name – she was awarded her nickname by the Empire admiralty.\r\nIn 2014 – when she was eighteen – Yuko’s hometown was obliterated by a Siren attack. The invaders, who had used the St. Lawrence River as a buffer, opened a portal at Lake Ontario. The only reason she survived is because she decided to go to work earlier than normal that day (she worked at a retail store which had an underground bunker in case of emergency – thanks to the CEO’s paranoia about Sirens and other disasters).\r\nRiddled with Survivor’s Guilt and PTSD, she had thrown herself into her studies/training while enrolled at the Peterborough Naval Academy. Despite counseling, psychiatry, and medication he was unable to make friends with his peers at the academy – who froze her out due to a lack of understanding of her conditions (that Yuko, in turn, never properly explained to begin with as it was too sensitive a topic). By her senior year at the academy, however, she had become the undisputed number one cadet in many years – her hard work having paid off. Her only emotional support was her instructor, then-Commodore Caroline Beau – who often conversed with her outside of training hours.\r\nYuko takes a sympathetic, informal stance to her work and understands the immense responsibility that her position entails. In spite of this, her words are nevertheless firm, demanding, and resolute – delivering the comprehension that she wants the absolute best for those around her.\r\nOutside of work hours, she is playful and teasing – occasionally making references to pop culture and internet memes. In spite of this, she is also shown to be quite deceptive; as demonstrated in Kitsune’s Oath, withholding Subject Blossom from Akagi but eventually introducing her in the cleanest manner possible – earning her the everlasting respect of the Sakura girls at base.\r\nWith the help of his beloved port, Yuko eventually overcomes the horrors of her past – and challenges the future with a renewed focus.\r\n\r\nHere’s the list of her service medals (depicted as undress ribbons), in order of precedence:\r\n1) [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) – Awarded following the defeat of IJN Taihou, IJN Shoukaku, and IJN Zuikaku (among other forces) following the Second Battle of Midway (April 2021). This is the highest honour a Maple Monarchy citizen can receive.\r\n2) Cross of Valour (CV) – Awarded following the defeat of IJN Jintsuu and her forces near the waters of American Samoa (December 2020). This is the second-highest honour a Maple Monarchy citizen can receive.\r\n3) Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) – Awarded by virtue of recognition for her outstanding contribution to the Maple Monarchy, by way of advancing her nation’s interests. Awarded in August 2020.\r\n4) Commander of the Order of Military Merit (CMM) – Recognized for her outstanding contribution to the Maple Monarchy by way of consistently advancing her nation’s military interests. Awarded on August 2020.\r\n5) Member of the Order of Ontario (OOnt) – Awarded to longtime residents of Ontario, who have demonstrated a high level of individual excellence and achievement in any field. In Yuko’s case it is her service to Azur Lane. Awarded in May 2020.\r\n6) Star of Military Valour (SMV) – Awarded following the Battle of the Solomon Islands (May 2020); intended to honour those who have shown conspicuous acts of valour in the face of enemy hostility.\r\n7) Star of Courage (SC) – Awarded following the First Battle of Midway (September 2019).\r\n8) Meritorious Service Cross (military division, MSC) – Awarded in recognition by carrying out meritorious acts bringing benefit and honour for Azur Lane and the Maple Monarchy. Awarded in February 2020.\r\n9) General Campaign Star (GCS) – Awarded following numerous Siren incursions near Hawaii in late 2019.\r\n\r\nSome other details (meta or otherwise) about Yuko:\r\n1) Her nickname is a reference to Kazuma Kiryu.\r\n2) She shares her favourite hobbies with me.\r\n3) She is actually the gender-bent version of my main SKK OC, Tatsuya Yukimura (“Yuki”). Who, in turn, is completely based on me – if I had grown up in <i>AL</i>'s world (well, my version of it). You can read their tale here.\r\n4) Her grandfather immigrated to the Maple Monarchy in the 1960s with his wife. He was a Sakura Empire otaku, so he changed family name (and his) to Yukimura.\r\n5) In a very special universe, she’s the brother-in-law of ArchiveSlave’s SKK OC – Alexander Cochrane.\r\n[/expand]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":45306,"created_at":"2013-05-17T04:19:23.151-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-02T19:32:50.005-05:00","title":"usa-tan_(saitou_atsushi)","body":"うさたん\r\n\r\n[[Original]] character by [[Saitou Atsushi (pal No Komado)|]].

Since then however the species has become overall less antagonistic and much more friendlier. \r\n\r\nThey are [[reptile_girl|dinosaur-like]] with large snouts in place of a mouth, from which they shoot white [[egg]]s out of to attack. They have long [[eyelashes]], [[eyeshadow]] and wear an [[ornate ring]]. They wear an [[huge_bow|oversized bow]] on the back of their heads as well as have [[claws]].\r\n\r\nBirdos come in a variety of colors, though the main color is pink. Compared to [[Toad_(mario)|]]s and [[Yoshi]]s, Birdos are much more consistently represented by a singular individual in a given game, where it's much rarer to see the rest of the species or a multitude in one place.\r\n\r\nh4.
