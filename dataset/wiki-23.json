Newhalf is a Japanese slang word for a pre-op or non-op male-to-female trans person, also referred to as \"shemale\" (シーメール). The word \"newhalf\" was originally used for referring a male who had begun to transition to female but kept her lower body the same; literally a \"new half\". Due to Danbooru's usage of the word not reflecting its real world usage, functionally using it more as a synonym for \"futa without pussy\", the tag was renamed to use that instead.

Tagging Checklist\r\n\r\nThis checklist of tagging criteria has been prepared in order to give a comprehensive idea on things to look out for when tagging. The tagging criteria has been categorized by priority to bring attention to the more important tags. \r\n\r\nFor your easy reference, common tags, along with links to relevant tag groups have been provided.\r\n\r\nAs the checklist is quite long, please take it easy when familiarizing yourself with this list. Begin with the more important tags at Level 0 (and all sub-levels), and then work your way upwards.\r\n\r\nh6. About Tagging Priorities\r\n\r\nLower level tags are essential tags. Images lacking lower level tags are considered insufficient for efficient cataloging and searching.\r\n\r\nHigher level tags are extra tags which describe the more intricate details of an image, but are more difficult to apply correctly, usually due to potential for debate, or a higher requirement of knowledge of otherwise obscure topics such as memes.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Note to taggers:[/b] This checklist is still in a very early stage, You may help out in expanding this checklist. However, if any part of this list grows too large, please inform the forums about creating a tag group. Remember to reference this tagging checklist!\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Ignore, Do NOT Tag\r\n\r\n[b]Subjective tags[/b] that express opinions or subjective critique on images. Common examples are badass, cute, good, evil, moe, sexy and most other adjectives. A full list of known subjective tags may be found at [[Tag group:Subjective]].\r\n\r\n[b]Subjective themes,[/b] such as [i]misleading thumbnails[/i] or whether something is funny or sad, are also not to be tagged.\r\n\r\nThese are better done with Pools, or even multiple tags.\r\nFor a categorized, but by no means complete, list of pools, see [[pool groups]].\r\nThe Infamous \"Misleading Thumbnails\" Pool is at Pool #1229.\r\n\r\nh6.

In these cases, it isn't necessary to include character tags for them; the [[original]] tag is enough.\r\n** Sometimes, such a character may become recurring, limited to a single artist, or multiple artists on a very small scale.

Her catchphrase is \"-[[poi]]\" (-ぽい), meaning \"maybe?\". Her \"dogness\" upon remodel seems to have inspired personifications of the destroyer in other franchises. The [[Yuudachi_(warship_girls_r)|]] in [[Warship Girls R]] has fake dog ears and a [[doge]]-like expression, while the [[Yuudachi (azur lane)|]] in [[Azur Lane]] is a dog girl outright along with the rest of the Shiratsuyu-class.\r\n\r\nHer remodel's change in appearance and personality alludes to her alleged performance in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and her nickname, \"Nightmare of Solomon\". Her artist tweeted that her hair flaps were to reflect her \"ferocious hound\"-like history during her final battle. While the historical Yuudachi was indeed present during the battle, the name \"Nightmare of Solomon\" was the name US Marines stationed on Guadalcanal christened a night bombardment - a night bombardment that Yuudachi did not participate in.\r\n\r\nh4.

A \"variation\" refering to a solo dance in ballet.\r\n\r\nA dedicated and hardworking umamusume with talent. Despite her constant failures, she keeps on going, strongly believing she will make a major comeback.

The titular video was released in 2001 by Coat Corporation, but the term has expanded to include other works by other companies like Acceed, Samson Video, etc.\r\n\r\nThe meme originally started around mid-2005, after the Japanese baseball player [[Tadano Kazuhito]] was involved in a scandal after his past identity as one of the gay porn actors in the original [i]Inmu[/i] movie was leaked. Leading to his dismissial from the Japanese baseball league and subsequent move to the United States.\r\n\r\nIt's often paired with [[gachimuchi|Gachimuchi Pants Wrestling]] (Wrestling Series) and [[kuso miso technique|Shit Soup Technique]] ([[Yaranaika]]) as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ) since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s. However, when [[Niconico]] emerged in the late 2000s, it was considered an arch-enemy of [[Gachimuchi]] and fans would often flame each other's videos. While Gachimuchi would become popular internationally and more recognized after several Gachi MADs were uploaded (and re-uploaded) on [[YouTube]], it would later be supplanted by Inmu on Nico Nico Douga and within the Japanese community after more videos of [[Yajuu Senpai]] were uncovered around the 2010s.\r\n\r\nFans typically refer to an actor in one of the works by an initialism of their name (e.g. Tadano -> TDN, Yajuu Senpai -> YJSNPI, etc.) with either \"Aniki\" (兄貴, lit. \"Big Brother\") or \"Aneki\" (姉貴, lit. \"Big Sister\") attached to them at the end, corresponding to the actor's gender. This is called \"TDN Notation\" (TDN表記).\r\n\r\nInmu is often linked with the [[Cookie (Touhou)|Cookie☆]] series of [[Touhou]] memes, after they latched onto the original video that started the meme (even coining the name it now uses), and the developments thereafter relating to said video.\r\n\r\nh4.

It can also be considered a style of [[meme]].\r\n\r\nIn the most common form, many rows of fixed-width ASCII characters are arranged to depict a [[logo]], above which appears a picture of a character or object, usually with a speech bubble beside it. Artists often make use of [[emphasis lines]] to give context to their subject. The defining feature of this [[meme]] is that no two components of the image can match. Quotes, onomatopoeia, artist [[commentary|commentaries]], tags, [[furigana]], and so on: no matter how many elements go into the image, each one is from a different source. Aside from the text, the picture itself often combines several characters into a kind of [[chimera]]. For example, the earliest known example of this [[ASCII art]] depicts a creature with [[Juushimatsu Juushoku]]'s head and the body of a dog, with a speech bubble saying \"meow!!\" and the caption \"chick\".\r\n\r\n[[2channel]] users often deploy these pictures to defuse tensions in heated discussion threads full of arguments and flaming. Posting a Mujun-Gatamari usually carries an implicit meaning of \"C'mon, you guys, chill out.\" In these cases, posters often introduce their image with a catchphrase meaning \"殺伐としたスレに~が!! (Into the bloody fray of this thread, *** has arrived!!)\" This usage originated with another [[ASCII art]] character, [[youkan_(food)|Youkan]] Man. Images of cheerful Youkan Man, who keeps on smiling no matter how many times he is cut in half, were once a popular option for calming down flame wars.
