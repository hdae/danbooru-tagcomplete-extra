The following are general guidelines on how to get promoted:\r\n\r\n* [b]Builder[/b] - Make a large number of improvements to the site, such as by uploading, translating, tagging, contributing to forum discussions or anything else that is helpful to other users.\r\n* [b]Contributor[/b] - Contribute a large number of high-quality uploads. It is important to have few deleted uploads (the usual case is under 5% of the total uploads submitted in the last few months).\r\n* [b]Approver[/b] - Have an excellent record of high quality uploads, with very few deleted. Approver promotions typically happen a few times a year, depending on the overall size of the [[about:mod_queue|modqueue]] and the number of currently active approvers, and only a handful of users are picked each time.","is_locked":true,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":71728,"created_at":"2016-01-19T14:16:23.469-05:00","updated_at":"2025-07-15T08:58:42.109-04:00","title":"rare_cheesecake","body":"A type of [[cheesecake]] that doesn't require baking.

Each copyright gets their own tag.\r\n\r\nThe challenge was originally started on May 13, 2013, by twitter user [[monyomoke]], establishing a prompt where participants were to draw [[Touhou]] characters [[komeiji_koishi|Koishi]], [[Nazrin]], and/or [[ibaraki_Kasen|Kasen]]. After a couple months, however, the organizer decided to quit, since he was tired. The role of organizer has since been passed over a couple of times.\r\n\r\nThe Touhou prompt is currently being hosted by \"@1draw_night\":[https://twitter.com/1draw_night]. They also have \"a website\":[http://1draw.aqn.jp] which hosts the artworks posted at the hashtag, with the artists' permission.\r\n\r\nOther accounts dealing with different copyrights have been appearing.

Her clothing choice ([[white kimono]], [[black skirt|black]] [[frilled skirt|frilled]] [[hakama short skirt]], [[black socks|black kneehighs]], white [[hachimaki]]) are now easily visible. However, one noticeable difference from these plans is the presence of helicopter landing markings on her flight deck, which is reflective of her [[JS Hyuuga|JMSDF DDH namesake]].\r\n\r\n[[Hyuuga (kancolle)|]] is most notable for being an \"Aviation Battleship\" after problems with her fifth turret (which detonated during gunnery practice), and the sinking of most major fleet carriers made the IJN desperate for more carrier capacity. Historically, this never panned out well, as the IJN was out of pilots and planes to launch by the time Hyuuga and Ise were ready. Her Kai Ni partially reflects a \"2/3 conversion\" plan that would have retained only the two forward main gun mounts and convert the rest into a carrier. This was historically ruled out as well, since the capacity would be too big for the launching facility (2 catapults) to keep up, causing delays when launching attack squadrons.\r\n\r\nh4.

First published in January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by and created to compete with the already established [[Buck Rogers]] adventure strip.\r\n\r\nThe comic strip follows the adventures of [[Flash Gordon]] and his companions [[Dale Arden]] and [[Dr. Hans Zarkov]] in an alien planet called Mongo and their fight against [[Ming the Merciless]], Mongo's evil ruler.\r\n\r\nThe Flash Gordon comic series has been translated into a wide variety of media, including motion pictures, television and animated series in several different countries across the world and during many decades. \r\n\r\nFlash Gordon was featured in three vintage serial films starring American actor Buster Crabbe: \"Flash Gordon\" (1936), \"Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars\" (1938), and \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" (1940). The first Flash Gordon serial remains copyrighted, but the compilation made of the second serial, and the third serial itself are in the public domain.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 a \"campy styled\" Flash Gordon film was produced to critical acclaim. It stars former Playgirl-centerfold Sam J. Jones in the title role. Its plot is based loosely on the first few years of the comic strip (in particular the famous Alex Raymond Sunday page, \"Flight of the Hawkmen\") revising Flash's backstory by making him the quarterback of the New York Jets instead of a polo player. \r\n\r\nRaymond's drawings feature heavily in the opening credits of the 1980 film, as does the signature theme-song [b]\"Flash!\"[/b] by rock band [[queen_(band)|Queen]], who composed and performed the entire musical score.\r\n\r\nThe latest version, a Flash Gordon television series, appeared on the United States Syfy in 2007–2008.\r\n\r\nh4.

For example, [[4koma]] implies [[comic]], and [[fate/stay_night]] implies [[fate_(series)]]. \r\n\r\nSince implications are applied automatically with no way to override them, they are not used in situations where one tag is only commonly, but not always, tagged with another. Special care should be taken to consider potential edge cases when requesting the creation of an implication.\r\n\r\nImplications are only used when both tags are of the same type (general, copyright, character, or artist). Character tags do not imply their respective copyrights, as the maintenance burden for such a system would be too high and of questionable benefit (see topic #10624).\r\n\r\nWhen two tags refer to exactly the same concept, an [[help:tag_aliases|alias]] should be created instead.\r\n\r\nYou can request that an implication be created using the \"bulk update request form\":/bulk_update_requests/new.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":54269,"created_at":"2014-05-25T11:08:44.011-04:00","updated_at":"2025-07-10T20:03:01.556-04:00","title":"help:tag_aliases","body":"Tag aliases are used to fix a \"canonical\" version of a tag's name.

The antecedent is otherwise treated as being identical to the consequent for searches and some other actions.\r\n\r\nTag aliases differ from [[help:tag_implications|implications]]. In a tag implication, rather than redirecting tags, one tag automatically adds the other. In other words, aliases are for tags referring to the same thing, while implications are for situations where one tag describes a subset of the images belonging to another tag.\r\n\r\nYou can request that an alias be created by using the \"bulk update request form\":/bulk_update_requests/new.\r\n\r\nh4.
