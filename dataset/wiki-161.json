According to her profile from KOF 10th, she was based on the character [[Mine Fujiko]] from [i][[Lupin III]][/i].\r\n\r\nShe is the keyboardist for CYS, a rock band consisting of and named after the initals of [[Chris (kof)|]] (C), [[Nanakase Yashiro]] (Y), and herself (S).\r\n\r\nThey seemingly entered [[The King Of Fighters '97|The 1997 King of Fighters tournament]] to take revenge on [[Yagami Iori]] for canceling one or more of their shows, but as the tournament progresses, their Orochi blood awakens, thus remembering their status as the Four Heavenly Kings of [[Orochi (kof)|]] alongside [[Goenitz]].\r\n\r\nShe and Yashiro sacrifice themselves to awaken Orochi, who would later use Chris as a vessel. But Orochi's awakening was short-lived as [[Kusanagi Kyou|Kusanagi Kyo]] (possessing the Sword of the Kusanagi), Iori (possessing the Jewel of Yasakani, and the target of CYS), and [[Kagura Chizuru]] (possessing the Mirror of Yata) combine forces to seal Orochi alongside Chris's body.\r\n\r\nShe fights using grappling moves, especially [[wrestling]] throws, with her specialty being the [[german suplex]] in her normal form, and [[electricity]] as [[Orochi Shermie]].\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a running gag that the bangs covering her eyes will never reveal her eyes.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["シェルミー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":8590,"created_at":"2008-10-13T00:21:13.664-04:00","updated_at":"2020-09-14T17:38:33.689-04:00","title":"petticoat","body":"A women's undergarment consisting of material draped from the waist and worn under a skirt or dress.
