The captain of this ship is [[Jeffrey Wilder]].\r\n\r\nAlthough one-quarter the size of the current Macross Class warships (being equivalent to a 400 meter class vessel typical of regular carriers) the Macross Quarter can transform from a warship (cruiser mode) to [[Storm Attacker]] mode (battle mode) for close combat. The Macross Quarter boasts high mobility and combat performance even though it is the size of a mid-scale warship.\r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter is a compound vessel consisting of five warships. The central hull consists of the main body and legs. The forward port side aircraft carrier is designated ARMD-L while the starboard side gunship is designated ARMD-R. The rear starboard-side mobile battery warship is BASTER-R and the rear port side mobile battery warship is BASTER-L. These design mechanisms were aimed at simplifying the transformation. Since each unit carries its own reaction engine and fold engine they can be deployed as independent warships or a fleet. \r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter has the capabilities of an aircraft carrier/amphibious assault spaceship, close-quarter combat capabilities through transformation to storm attack mode and can carry a maximum of 80 variable fighters and Destroids. \r\n\r\nThe Gatling-type buster cannon -which can be used as a Heavy Quantum Reaction gun- is suitable for heavy anti-ship combat. In addition to a high output reaction engine cluster, the Macross Quarter has the overall performance worthy of the \"Macross\" name despite being within the small, 400m class of carriers.\r\n\r\nThe Macross Frontier fleet's Yaesu Heavy Industries and the L.A.I. Corporation took charge of design and construction of a concept for a \"relatively small and excellent maneuverability variable attack space aircraft carrier\". \r\n\r\nThe Macross Quarter was built in Macross Frontier's dock and when handed over to the S.M.S. upon completion, it was moored to a special pier on Island 1's port side. The vessel functioned as a central command and graveyard facility for the S.M.S. group. \r\n\r\nOriginally the Macross Quarter was registered as a \"Special Duty Operation Warship\" and when incorporated into the New U.N.

This makes the language harder to learn, though many agree it leads to much fewer errors popping up unexpectedly while your program is running.\r\n\r\nRust also has a notion of what is considered [b]safe[/b] and [b]unsafe[/b] code. Usually all rust code is considered safe. But if you put any code inside an unsafe block ([code]unsafe { some code here }[/code]) many of the strict rules of rust are ignored, which makes this code be considered unsafe. Unsafe code is necessary when doing things that safe rust do not support (like calling code from other programming languages).\r\nSome argue that this makes fatal errors easier to find (compared to other languages) since they are almost always found inside unsafe code.\r\n\r\nh4.

He is an extraordinarily strong warrior and has wandered many battlefields due to an oracle granted to him, but he also has a past of destroying everything dear to him due to a madness instilled into him. To atone for that crime, a new oracle was handed down that made him a slave for the span of three years and forced him into a role of absolute obedience to his master's orders. Brandished as a show of his superior's power with no thought of freedom and a healthy work environment, Heracles was exhausted in mind and body and sought the days without battle within his mind. Perhaps due to that, it seems like his current state as a slave feels more restful to him than his time as a bloodsoaked warrior.
