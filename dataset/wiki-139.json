Each bomb is divided into individual modules which can be solved in any order. The bomb is successfully defused when all playable modules are deactivated. However, neither side can see the other's screen. In keeping with its name, the game relies on communication between the players. The defuser must describe the module they are trying to deactivate to the expert, who must then relay instructions from the manual to the defuser. Certain factors affect deactivation, such as the color and text of certain buttons, particular symbols, number and color of wires, etc. Each bomb allows a number of \"strikes\", or wrong guesses. If the defuser makes too many strikes or if the timer runs out, the bomb will explode.\r\n\r\nThe game was originally created for [[virtual reality]] systems and other systems supporting VR, but this requirement was removed in a 2018 update.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["完全爆弾解除マニュアル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147254,"created_at":"2022-07-20T19:09:28.027-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-18T20:05:43.733-04:00","title":"yao_qi_niang","body":"Yao Qi Niang is a mascot of You Yao Qi (有妖气, otherwise known as U17.com), a Chinese website for hosting original comics and animations, as well as art through You Xiong (有熊).

This revolutionary real robot show introduced mecha with armor plates that appeared to fit loosely over an internal skeleton. These detailed and somewhat plausible robotic forms sparked a fresh wave of designs in mecha anime that has continued to this day and can be seen in newer productions such as the live action [[Transformers]] films. \r\n\r\nNagano has also worked on some designs for the [[Gundam]] universe starting with the [[Zeta Gundam]] series from 1985.\r\n\r\nFrom there, Nagano went on to design elegant and graceful mecha for his manga The [[Five Star Stories]] that displayed elongated lines, delicate curves and a degree of decoration and detail that appealed to the imaginations of a generation of mecha fans. Nagano can be called an innovator in the field of mecha design.\r\n\r\nFool for the City, his first manga, came out in 1985 but it was 1986 that brought The Five Star Stories, which is still in production today. Nagano founded Toys Press, Inc. to publish much of his work. Nagano is a very versatile man and has been a professional artist, manga writer, musician and fashion designer. Some of his artbooks show him dressed up as a female character from [[Sailor Moon]] for cosplay.\r\n\r\nHe is married to seiyuu Maria Kawamura.\r\n\r\nNagano is also the co-author (along with Kunihiko Ikuhara) and illustrator of Schell Bullet, a novel in two volumes.\r\n\r\nHas since been involved with Automatic Flowers to create the anime movie [[Hana no Utame Gothicmade]], which he worked on as the producer, director, chief writer, character and mechanical designer. The film infamously hasn't received a wider home release due to Nagano's belief that it should only be experienced in a theater setting.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":162344,"created_at":"2023-04-13T11:56:03.603-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-13T11:56:03.603-04:00","title":"k31","body":"The [b]Karabiner Modell 1931[/b] or K31 straight-pull [[bolt action]] [b][[rifle]][/b], chambered for the 7.5×55mm Swiss [[rifle cartridge|cartridge]] or 7.62×51mm NATO.

Despite their name, the fin funnels equipped on Nu Gundam/Hi-Nu Gundam are in function \"[[bit (gundam)|bits]]\", since they have built-in generators rather than the E-caps used by [[funnels (gundam)|]]. While this made them much more expensive to construct, and allowed less modules to be equipped than the standard, this had the enormous benefit of giving the fin funnels a tremendously long operational time. Circling the battlefield on their own, the fin funnels could be utilized in far more creative and strategic ways than standard funnels.\r\n\r\nThe actual beam fired by the fin funnels was also more powerful, given that they are emitted by a generator instead of an E-cap, allowing for better performance compared to Zeon's funnels. The fin funnels also had the ability to generate a unique beam shield, known as a \"fin funnel barrier\", to provide a defense against both beam weaponry and solid projectiles with lower outputs compared to the beam shield's power consumption. Although these unique funnels proved incredibly effective and flexible in purpose, they were also much larger than the standard funnel, making them easier targets to shoot down. With the help of the [[Psycho Frame]] technology, Nu Gundam/Hi-Nu Gundam pilot [[Amuro Ray]] can utilize these fin funnels more effectively by thoughts alone.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the Hi-Nu Gundam is capable of recharging and refueling its fin funnels, thanks to the upgrades on its backpack.\r\n\r\nThis tag can also refer to fin-shaped remote weapons or those that physically resemble the Nu Gundam/Hi-Nu Gundam's fin funnels.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フィン・ファンネル","フィンファンネル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":32891,"created_at":"2012-02-25T20:45:03.568-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-07T22:57:03.970-04:00","title":"hi-nu_gundam","body":"Japanese: Hi-νガンダム\r\n\r\nThe alternate interpretation of the [[Nu Gundam]] featured in  [[char's_counterattack_-_beltorchika's_children|Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack - Beltorchika's Children]].\r\n\r\nIn addition to a more bulky design, the RX-93-ν2 Hi-Nu Gundam sports an exclusively white and purple (or blue) color scheme to distinguish it from the white and black (or midnight blue) paint job on the RX-93 Nu Gundam. Like the Nu Gundam, the Hi-Nu Gundam also has a mouthpiece with three vents. \r\n\r\nThe most prolific difference, however, is its distinct back boosters and revised [[fin funnels|fin funnel]] system. The fairly standard backpack design of the Nu Gundam is replaced with a much more unique dual \"long booster\" system, with another long booster situated between them and two propellant tanks angled below the dual long boosters. These boosters were capable of great accelerations, and the propellant tanks extended the duration of time the boosters could remain active. The long boosters also served as the storage area for the unit's fin funnels. Also, unlike the Nu Gundam, the Hi-Nu Gundam could recharge the fin funnel's power supply, extending their performance time.\r\n\r\nApart from the obvious visual differences, the Hi-Nu Gundam also expands on the Nu Gundam's armaments, with the addition of a powerful [[machine gun]] in its right forearm as well as the inclusion of an extra [[energy sword|beam saber]], bringing the number of beam sabers up to three. The suit can also use a Hyper Mega Bazooka Launcher, an improved model of the weapon used by the [[Hyaku Shiki]] during the [[zeta gundam|Gryps Conflict]], when heavier firepower is required.\r\n\r\nThanks to its [[Psycho Frame]], a vast improvement over the psycommu system prevalent among mobile suits designed to be used by Newtype pilots, the Hi-Nu Gundam's pilot had much greater control over the mobile suit, piloting it almost as if it were an extension of his own body and bringing out the suit's fullest performance.\r\n\r\nIt is piloted and designed in-universe by [[Amuro Ray]].

This allows a Newtype pilot to control the mobile suit as if it were their own body with limitations.
