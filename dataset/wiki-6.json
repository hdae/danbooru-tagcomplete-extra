Her [[rigging]] is based off her real-life bridge and platforms with several [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, which can be operated with a built-in trigger, while she uses a [[staff]] for her shikigami aircraft with her real-life [[flight deck]] used as a banner. \r\n\r\nShe is depicted as a highly calm individual, with degrees of her \"coolness\" varying in several fan works. Some depict her as stoic and somewhat air-headed, others as very ladylike and quiet, or even almost [[expressionless]] in some cases. \r\n\r\nh4.

The trilogy consists of [[Star Wars: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]], [[Star Wars: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]] and [[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]. After the series rights were sold by Lucas to [[Disney]], a new \"sequel trilogy\" was announced in 2012. This trilogy began with [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]] in 2015 and continued with [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]] in 2017 and [[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]] in 2019.\r\n\r\nSeveral animated series related to the main saga were also released. Among them was [[Star Wars: Clone Wars]] in 2003, [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]] in 2008, [[Star Wars: Rebels]] in 2014 and [[Star Wars: Resistance]] in 2018.  \r\n\r\nTwo spin-off \"Star Wars Anthology\" films were released between each sequel film. The first Anthology film, [[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]], was released in 2016 and is set in the period of the Galactic Civil War of the original films. A film focusing on Han Solo called [[Solo: A Star Wars Story]] was released in 2018.\r\n\r\nA live action series called [[The Mandalorian]] and a video game called [[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]] were also released in late 2019.\r\n\r\nThe Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture; is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\r\n\r\nh4.

As such she is often found fangirling over her fellow schoolmates/colleagues. She is also frequently depicted cheering or observing the other uma girls from the side, often waving glowsticks around (like RL idol otaku). This trait of hers is exaggerated in fanart, where she will often react violently (i.e. heart attack, massive nosebleed, exploding) [[so_moe_i'm_gonna_die!|to whatever wholesome or adorable event she deems \"precious\".]] Because of it, she is easily seen both in fanarts or in game, watching other umammusumes or ending up interacting with them.\r\n\r\nHer portrayal as an otaku is due to the RL horse's nickname of \"Deviant Horse\" or \"Hentai Horse\", referring to the horse's success as a Jack-of-all-trades (and not any particular sexual attraction to other horses).

However, a large complement of [[mecha]], which included several [[destroid]]s and the brand new [[VF-4]] variable fighters, were onboard the new vessel. Also, a defense [[fleet]] composed of many Earth and [[Zentradi]] warships provided escort for the Megaroad. The Megaroad class ships were eventually succeded by the bigger and more advanced [[city 7|City Class Starships]]. \r\n\r\nThe SDF-2 Megaroad-01 was designed by [[Miyatake Kazutaka]] in the 1980s.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SDF-2","Megaroad-01"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":41050,"created_at":"2012-12-17T13:09:03.079-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-10T19:43:55.090-05:00","title":"uraga_class_carrier","body":"A fictional [[military]] [[spacecraft]] from the [[MACROSS]] science fiction anime series.\r\n\r\nThe [b]Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier[/b] is the next generation stealth carrier built to replace the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers in the Earth's military forces. \r\n\r\nThe Uraga Class, built with weaponry, armor and maneuverability comparable to a cruiser, is often used as the flagship of small [[U.N. Spacy]] and [[N.U.N.S.]] fleets. \r\n\r\nAt 550 meters long, the Uraga Class ships are much larger conventional spacecraft but still significantly smaller than the [[SDF-1|SDF-1 Macross]] or the later New Macross Class ships. The Uraga is built with a stealth composition superstructure and features a dual deck launching system for [[variable fighter]]s; one deck running the latter dorsal two-thirds of the ship and an internal deck underneath with a launching deck in the forward third. This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.\r\n\r\nThese ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the [[ARMD]] carriers but the U.N.G. remains committed to replacing the older ARMD carriers one by one with Uraga Class ships. As more Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are built, they are poised to become the mainstay combat and carrier ship for the U.N. Spacy. Many Uraga Class vessels are part of the Earth's defense fleet and are found serving as command ships for large groups of [[Guantanamo Class Stealth Carrier]]s and [[Northampton Class Stealth Frigate]]s.

It is the main attack mecha of all the Zentradi forces and is produced in the trillions in massive automated factories scattered across the [[milky way]] [[galaxy]].\r\n\r\nThere are specialized variants of the walker, which range from light and heavy [[artillery]] versions armed with [[missile]]s to an unarmed version designed for Reconaissance and Electronic Countermeasure missions.\r\n\r\nIn [[real life]] the Regult was designed by [[Kawamori Shouji]] in the early 80s and its design was inspired by the [[T-34]] [[tank]]s of [[World War II]] and the [[AT-ST]] from [[Star Wars]].

He and his wife, Thea von Harbou, wrote the silent film, which starred Gustav Fröhlich, Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. \r\n\r\nIt is regarded as a pioneering work of the serious science fiction genre in movies, being among the first feature length movies of the genre ever made. It also has been considered a semi-[[cyberpunk]] film created many decades before the genre even began. \r\n\r\nMetropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's ruler, and Maria, a poor worker, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city. \r\n\r\nThe movie was made in [[Germany]] during the \"Weimar Period\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic]. Filming took place in 1925 at a cost of approximately five million Reichsmarks. The art direction draws influence from Bauhaus, Cubist and Futurist design.\r\n\r\nMetropolis was met with a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it pictorially beautiful and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of naiveté.\r\n\r\nNumerous attempts have been made to restore the film since the 1970s. Music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists such as [[Freddie Mercury]], Loverboy and Adam Ant in 1984. A new reconstruction of Metropolis was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 2001, and the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in the same year, the first film thus distinguished. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process, the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\r\n\r\nh4.

A [[revealing clothes|skimpy]] version of the costume also briefly appeared in her first confession stream.\r\n\r\nThe costume consists of a dark blue [[nun]] habit with white double triangular [[breast curtain]]s and a dark blue [[pelvic curtain]]. There are two \"skimpy\" versions of the outfit, one with the inner garments removed (including [[no bra|bra]] and [[no panties|panties]]) revealing the wearer's [[underboob]] and only has the aforementioned curtains to cover their private parts. The other \"skimpy\" version swaps the long pelvic curtain for an even shorter one covering the crotch, leaving the [[midriff]] exposed. On December 2022, a revised version of the original costume was revealed. This version of the costume differs by using the same hairstyle of her [[houshou marine (marching band)|band costume]] and the addition of a suggestive [[underboob cutout]] on the costume.\r\n \r\nWhile this costume is technically unofficial (as it never received an official model for obvious reasons), it has gained notoriety within and out of the Hololive fanbase for its frequent usage by Marine herself, which resulted in it gaining the status of a [[meme attire]].\r\n\r\nThis tag is applicable to any posts that:\r\n* Features Marine herself wearing any variant of the outfit or derivative of it, and not a generic [[nun]] outfit.\r\n* Has other character(s) wearing any variant of the outfit or derivative of it.

He would later become famous as the winner of the 2022 Japanese Derby ([[Tokyo Yushun]]), defeating [[Equinox (racehorse)|]], who would finally flourish at the 2022 Autumn Tenno-sho and dominate the field onwards. After a failed bet at l'Arc, a win at the Kyoto Kinen and having his main jockey (the legendary [[Take Yutaka]]) incapacitated during his rematches with Equinox, Do Deuce would finally claim his third G1 win at the 2023 [[Arima Kinen]], after Equinox's retirement and with Take Yutaka. He would later claim his fourth G1 at the 2024 Autumn Tenno Sho, making him the first colt in history to have JRA G1 victories every year from age 2 to age 5. Among the fillies, only [[Mejiro Dober (racehorse)|]], [[Vodka (racehorse)|]] and [[Buena Vista (racehorse)|]] did the same. Not long after, he claimed his fifth G1 at the 2024 Japan Cup, edging out Shin Emperor and Durezza (who finished in dead heat) by a neck.

History\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) was the [[military]] arm of the anti-communist nation of South Vietnam, from the country's inception during the post-colonial division of Indochina in 1955, until the reunification of Vietnam in 1975. During those twenty years, ARVN was effectively in a constant state of war against [[communism|communist]] forces: fighting both a [[guerilla]] insurgency in the south of the country against the [[viet cong|National Liberation Front]], and a conventional conflict in the north of the country against the North Vietnam's military arm, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN).\r\n\r\nEven after the mass deployment of American and Allied forces in 1965, ARVN forces continued to bear the brunt of the fighting during the [[Vietnam War]]. Unfortunately, ARVN also became more and more tied to the politics of South Vietnam, and political officer appointments, corruption and factional infighting continually degraded the army's ability to continue the conflict. Despite these issues, ARVN's efforts continued to prove decisive, from 1967 to 1968 to 1972.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of Allied troops in 1973, end of American supplies in 1974, and PAVN offensive in 1975 together proved to be the death knell for South Vietnam. Though ARVN troops continued to fight bravely in places, even lacking arms and ammunition, the country they fought to defend was rapidly collapsing. On 30 April 1975, PAVN forces captured the South Vietnamese capital city of Saigon (modern day [[Ho Chi Minh]] City), and what was left of the South Vietnamese government either surrendered or fled. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, and the country said army was pledged to defend, had ceased to exist. \r\n\r\nh1.
