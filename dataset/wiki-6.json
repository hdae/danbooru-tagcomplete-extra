Tragedy struck one day when Vega witnessed the murder of his beautiful mother at the hands of his unattractive stepfather. Her murder was punishment for disrespecting him as his stepfather believed.

Together with the [[Guntank]] and the [[Guncannon]], it is the final mobile suit of the [[Earth Federation]]'s [b]Project V[/b]. It also serves as the [[Gundam]] franchise's mascot. It is piloted by the series' protagonist, [[Amuro Ray]]. \r\n\r\nExtremely powerful and resilient (thanks to its experimental [i]Luna Titanium Alloy[/i] or [i]Gundarium[/I]), it is equipped with an advanced A.I. system that improves the combat abilities of its [[pilot]]. The model was designed by [[Tem Ray]] specifically to counter the threat of [[Zeon]]'s standard mobile suits, most notably the [[Zaku II]].\r\n\r\nVisually, the RX-78-2 has a white, red, blue, and yellow color scheme. It also has a white [[V-fin]] on its head unit, and is often seen carrying a couple of [[energy sword]]s, a [[shield]] and a powerful [[beam rifle]]. Not to be confused with the [[Gundam Mk II]], [[Strike Gundam]], [[Ground Gundam]], or [[Gundam GP-01 Zephyranthes]].\r\n\r\nIn real life it was designed by [[Ookawara Kunio]] and refined by [[Yasuhiko Yoshikazu]] in the late 70s (Yasuhiko designed the Gundam's face mask and color scheme.)\r\n\r\nThe first Gundam was inspired by [[Mazinger Z (mecha)]] and the [[power armor]]s from [[Starship Troopers]].\r\n\r\nh4.

A gaiden game, [i][[gunvolt chronicles luminous avenger ix|Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX]][/i], later follows after the events of [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt 1[/i] and focuses on Copen. There are also supplementary materials that expands on the serie's world and characters, such as [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt: Fleeting Memories[/i], prequel story taking place before the first game, as well as an OVA based on the first game released through the Nintendo 3DS eShop.
