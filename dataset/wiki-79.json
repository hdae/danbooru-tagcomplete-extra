She debuted in December 2017, and the small team behind her channel would later help found the studio.\r\n\r\nAfter its founding, the first new talent would debut under the studio in early 2018, [[Pinky Pop Hepburn]], with a familiar design by [[Mika Pikazo]], the same artist behind Kaguya Luna's design. She, alongside Luna, were intended to be a part of a new group called the [[Kotodama Tribe]], consisting of six more VTubers who never ended up coming to fruition.\r\n\r\nIt announced the end of its activities in fall 2019, after which Kaguya Luna and Pinky Pop Hepburn reverted back to their original company, Vic inc. while each maintained their music contracts with Sony Music's [[SACRA MUSIC]] and the label Anarchic Record respectively. By the end of 2021, both talent had disappeared.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[Sony Music Virtual]]\r\n\r\nh4.

His life takes a significant turn when he develops a close bond with Irene, his neighbor, and her son, Benicio. When her debt-ridden husband, Standard, is released from prison, the two men take part in what turns out to be a botched million-dollar heist that endangers the lives of everyone involved.\r\n\r\nPraised for its stylish direction, Gosling's performance, and a unique mix of action, suspense, and atmospheric storytelling, the film is celebrated for its striking cinematography and a synth-heavy soundtrack. \r\n\r\nThe film has since garnered a devoted fanbase and achieved a cult following, partly due to its portrayal of Gosling's character as a stoic, mysterious, and pent-up figure. \r\n\r\nh4.

She was initially seen from behind on the cover of the 13-20 May 2021 issue of Weekly [[Famitsu]] magazine (post #4488154), but it was not until December 28, 2021 that she made her full reveal.\r\n\r\nLike Kasuga Maru, Yawata Maru notably is modeled upon \"classic Japanese falconry\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takagari]. She carries an [[aircraft]] (a \"Mitsubishi A5M\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A5M], immediate predecessor to the famous \"zero\" fighter) on her left forearm with [[jesses]] tied to her equipment.\r\n\r\nYawata Maru has [[long_hair|long]] dark [[brown hair]] tied into [[twin braids]] rolled into a [[double bun]] hairstyle and [[blunt bangs]].  She has [[brown_eyes|brown]] [[tareme]]-style eyes.  Similar to [[shibafu_(glock23)|Shibafu's]] [[akagi (kancolle)|fleet]] [[kaga (kancolle)|carriers]], Yawata Maru wears a white [[dougi]] top with a red [[hakama short skirt]], and [[black socks|black]] [[ankle socks]].  On her left hand, she wears a thick falconry [[gloves|glove]].\r\n\r\nHer [[machinery|rigging]] involves a [[flight deck]] strapped to her right arm, falconry-related steel pouches strapped to her torso, and steel [[platform boots]].\r\n\r\nHistorically, the [i]Yawata Maru[/i] was second of the three [i]Nitta Maru[/i] class passenger-cargo liners, but was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into a light aircraft carrier, similar to the fate of the [i][[hiyou (kancolle)|Hiyou]][/i] and [i][[jun'you (kancolle)|Jun'you]][/i].  Like Kasuga Maru before her, she resembles \"her earlier anthropomorphized self on an advertisement alongside her sister-ships back in the 1940's.\":[http://otakei.otakuma.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/210.jpg]  She was never completed as a passenger liner, however, and was requisitioned and converted into a carrier before ever performing any duties as a passenger liner.\r\n\r\nYawata Maru spent most of her service ferrying aircraft, cargo, and passengers to various bases in the Pacific. She was badly damaged by an American submarine in early 1944. After repairs were completed in June 1944, the ship resumed transporting aircraft and cargo. During a return voyage from Singapore in September 1944, she was sunk by the submarine USS [i]Barb[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.
