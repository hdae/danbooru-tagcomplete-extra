The poem is a ballad in fourteen stanzas.\r\n\r\nThe Disney movies [i][[Fantasia (Disney)|]][/i] and [i]Fantasia 2000[/i] were based on this poem.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with an apprentice in magic who was given chores by an old sorcerer before leaving his workshop. As he grew tired of fetching water by pail, the apprentice enchanted a broom to do the work for him. Before long, the floor slowly began getting wet all over, and the apprentice realized that he cannot stop the broom from working because he didn't know the magic required to do so.\r\n\r\nHe split the broom with an axe to stop it, but each of the pieces it split into become a whole broom, resuming their task as normal. The room rapidly started flooding, and when it all seemed lost, the old sorcerer returned and quickly broke the spell. In the end, the old sorcerer stated that only a master should invoke powerful spirits.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[Broom (The Sorcerer's Apprentice)]]\r\n\r\nh4.

The park was constructed by Walt Disney Imagineering in the same style as Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida. Also at Tokyo Disney Resort is [[Tokyo DisneySea]] (東京ディズニーシー, Tōkyō DizunīShī) and Ikspiari (イクスピアリ), the domestic equivalents of DisneySea and Downtown Disney.\r\n\r\nThere are seven themed areas in the park: the World Bazaar; the four classic Disney lands: Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland; and two mini-lands: Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown. The park is noted for its extensive open spaces, to accommodate the large crowds that visit the park. In 2009, Tokyo Disneyland hosted approximately 13.65 million guests, ranking it as the third-most visited theme park in the world, behind its American sister parks, Magic Kingdom and Disneyland.\r\n\r\nh4.

Tragedy struck one day when Vega witnessed the murder of his beautiful mother at the hands of his unattractive stepfather. Her murder was punishment for disrespecting him as his stepfather believed.

In the RK 62 the rear sight is mounted on the rear of the receiver cover with tritium illuminated night-sights.
