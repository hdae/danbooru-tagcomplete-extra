Famous for its powerful soundtrack, over the top action and violence, intricate mechanical design by Oohata, multiple animation errors and bizarre story, M.D. Geist is generally seen as a bad production, but has also become somewhat of a cult classic.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the war-torn planet of Jerra has been locked in a war between the Earth government loyalists and the Nexrum corporation for decades. To counter Nexrum's advanced weapons, the Earth government developed one-man armies, the Most Dangerous Soldiers. However they proved to be far too strong, and most eventually lost their minds and went on rampage. Being one of the surviving Most Dangerous Soldiers, [[MDS-02 GEIST]] was put into stasis inside a satellite in Jerra's orbit. Years later, the satellite prison crashes on the desolate planet and Geist reawakens. He recovers a Powered Suit, battles with bandits and units of the Nexrum military and eventually joins a group of Earth army commandos in a mission to deactivate the secret doomsday weapon on Jerra: a self-replicating robot swarm known as \"Death Force\". However, there's more than meets the eye to Geist.\r\n\r\nA sequel OVA, \"M.D. Geist II: Death Force\", was made a decade later, alongside a comic book prequel. The 1986 OVA has also received a Director's Cut edition, which fixes the animation errors, adds more blood and some new footage.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["装鬼兵MDガイスト","装鬼兵M.D.ガイスト","MDガイスト"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":3953,"created_at":"2006-10-23T16:54:53.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-10T21:08:50.154-04:00","title":"school_swimsuit","body":"A standard school-issued [[one-piece_swimsuit|one-piece swimsuit]] usually blue, black, white or grey in color sometimes with the wearer's name written or printed on a white [[name_tag|name tag]] stitched across the chest.

The common sunflower is most recognizable by their single large yellow apical \"flower,\" with an initially greenish center that turns yellow-brown and then blackish as it matures.  They typically grow to heights of around 3 meters (10 feet) with record plants reach heights of 9+ meters (30+ feet). Sunflowers are grown for various purposes such as for food, cooking oil, livestock feed, and decoration. \r\n\r\nDomestic sunflowers come in a variety of colors beyond the common yellow, with colors such as cream color, gold, orange, red, mahogany, and chocolate brown.  While the common types only feature a singular apical flower (one that grows at the tip of the central stem), there are also varieties that grow many additional branching flowers.  The large blooms of the sunflower while commonly called a \"flower\" is in fact a \"flower head,\" a structure composed of many smaller flowers (florets) that together appear as one single flower.\r\n\r\nSunflowers and their relatives are heliotropic while they're developing, meaning that the plants will turn following the direction of the sun during the day.  As they get closer to maturing, the plant stiffen and lose it's ability to track the sun. Due to their heliotropic nature, most plants will mature locked facing toward the East, the direction of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\n* !post #6797029\r\n\r\nh4.

The game was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and first published by [[Konami]] in 1998 for the [[PlayStation 1]] video game console. \r\n\r\nIt is the sequel to Kojima's early MSX2 computer games [[Metal Gear (series)|]] and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The game featured cinematic cutscenes rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, as well as voice acting in numerous codec sequences.\r\n\r\nMetal Gear Solid follows [[Solid Snake]], a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit. Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike [spoilers]using an advanced combat [[mecha]] known as [[Metal Gear REX]][/spoilers].\r\n\r\nMetal Gear Solid was very well received by critics and sold many units. It is recognized by many experts as one of the best and most important video games of all time, and heralded as the game which made the stealth genre popular. \r\n\r\nThe commercial success of the title prompted the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and PC, titled [i]Metal Gear Solid: Integral[/i]; and a remake with enhanced graphics, [i]Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes[/i] was later released for the [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]]. The game has also spawned numerous sequels, prequels and spin-offs, including several games, a radio drama, comics, and novels.\r\n\r\nA direct sequel called [[metal gear solid 2: sons of liberty|Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]] was released in 2001.\r\n\r\nh4.
