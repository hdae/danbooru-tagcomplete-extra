Depending on the species, the tepals may be a different color than the center.\r\n\r\nIn the east, they are considered a symbol of wealth and good fortune, and since they bloom in early spring are often associated with the Chinese New Year.

They are perhaps best known in the West for their music featured in the anime series \"[[FLCL]]\" (Fooly Cooly), for which they composed and performed the entire soundtrack.\r\n\r\nOver the years, The Pillows have released numerous albums and singles, and have become one of the most influential and respected bands in the Japanese rock scene.

Well known for her line \"Puhaa~, Kyou mo ii tenki\" ([i]Exhale[/i], today's weather is good too.), while holding her [[yunomi]]. Portrayed in either [[chiikorin]]'s or [[Huei Nazuki]]'s style with [[short hair with long locks|short]] [[brown hair]], [[red eyes]], and no frills on her hair bow. Often drawn [[plump]] and with [[large breasts]]. \r\n\r\nGot into voice acting by being friends with [[Uzuki (cookie)|]] in high school, later working with [[Alison (alison_airlines)|Alison Airlines]]. As one of the main characters of Cookie, she received a very large of both positive and negative attention. Unlike the others, she mostly accepted it and was more open with the fans about how [[Hazuna Rio]] treated her. Her weight led to many comments, with haters calling her a pig. Besides her Puhaa line, other jokes include her cosplays of [[Kagamine Rin]] being drawn as the swimsuit from [[Kagamine Len no Bousou (vocaloid)|]], and her obsession with longhorn [[beetle]]s.\r\n\r\nShe also led to three derivative characters:\r\n* [[Sakenomi (cookie)|]]: \"Kono sakenomi ga!\" (You drunkard!).
