The park was constructed by Walt Disney Imagineering in the same style as Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida. Also at Tokyo Disney Resort is [[Tokyo DisneySea]] (東京ディズニーシー, Tōkyō DizunīShī) and Ikspiari (イクスピアリ), the domestic equivalents of DisneySea and Downtown Disney.\r\n\r\nThere are seven themed areas in the park: the World Bazaar; the four classic Disney lands: Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland; and two mini-lands: Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown. The park is noted for its extensive open spaces, to accommodate the large crowds that visit the park. In 2009, Tokyo Disneyland hosted approximately 13.65 million guests, ranking it as the third-most visited theme park in the world, behind its American sister parks, Magic Kingdom and Disneyland.\r\n\r\nh4.

History\r\nThe historical [i]Bache[/i] was launched in 7 July 1942. After being assigned to several bombardment mission in late 1943, she took part in the \"Battle of Surigao Strait\":/pools/9549 before sent back to the United States in late 1944 for her first overhaul. After completion, she was sent to cover fire support at [[Iwo Jima]] before being struck by a kamikaze attack on 13 May 1945, forcing her to return to the US and receive her second overhaul. After the war, she has been converted two times, first in 1950 as an escort destroyer, before being converted back into a destroyer in 1962.  On 6 Febuary 1968, [i]Bache[/i] was stuck by a gale during her visit on the Isle of Rhodes, Greece, and ran aground. Ironically for the in-game emphasis on her character, the US Navy deemed her unrecoverable and she was sold for scrap there.\r\n\r\nh4.

Appearance\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nThe historical [i]Ariake[/i] was the fifth of the [i]Hatsuharu[/i]-class but the first in an \"improved design\" that was meant to remedy the chronic stability issues of the first four [i]Hatsuharu[/i]s. Aside from lowered superstructures and a revised weapons suite, she and her sister ship [[Yuugure (Azur Lane)|]] were the first destroyers fitted with the 12.7 cm twin Type C mounts as used by the succeeding [[Shiratsuyu (Azur Lane)|]], [[Asashio (Azur Lane)|]], and [[Kagerou (Azur Lane)|]] classes. In addition, they both received two rudders, one aft of each propeller, in an attempt to reduce severe heeling at turns, only to have them removed after their trials in 1935 as the same design changes made the use of twin rudders redundant.\r\n\r\nAssigned to DesDiv 27, they escorted the Second Carrier Division ([[Hiryuu (Azur Lane)|]] and [[Souryuu (Azur Lane)|]]) in raids on Rabaul and Darwin. They repeated the same task for the Fifth CarDiv ([[Shoukaku (Azur Lane)|]] and [[Zuikaku (Azur Lane)|]]) in the battle of the Coral Sea.\r\n\r\nShe was sunk on July 28, 1943 by engaging B-25 Mitchell bombers while assisting [[Mikazuki (Azur Lane)|]]. This was after completing a troop transport at Tuluvu, New Britain (now part of Papua New Guinea), during which the two destroyers ran aground on a reef off Cape Gloucester.\r\n\r\nFor her retrofit form, see her [[ariake (retrofit) (azur lane)|corresponding page.]]\r\n\r\nh4.

The film stars Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, and [[Michael Keaton]] as the title character.\r\nThe story follows Barbara and Adam Maitland, a loving young couple who die in a car accident and find themselves caught in the Celestial Bureaucracy of the afterlife. Unable to move on, they haunt their rustic Connecticut home until it's bought by Charles and Delia Deetz, an insufferable yuppie couple with a goth daughter, [[lydia deetz|Lydia]]. Wishing to rid themselves of the Deetzes, they enlist the help of a malevolent ghost named Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetlejuice) to drive them out. But between Betelgeuse’s unwillingness to play fair and the increasingly strong bond between Lydia and the Maitlands, who come to see her as the daughter they never got to have, things go off the rails quickly.\r\n\r\nThe film is remembered for its dark humor and inventive visuals, helping to make Burton a household name. The score by Danny Elfman and a memorable musical sequence set to Harry Belafonte's \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\" also brought renewed attention to both performers.\r\n\r\nIn the years since its release, Beetlejuice spawned a franchise, including a late '80s-early '90s [[Beetlejuice (cartoon)|animated series of the same name]], a theatrical production that commenced in 2018, and a film sequel, [[Beetlejuice Beetlejuice]], released in 2024.\r\n\r\nH6.See also\r\n* [[Beetlejuice Beetlejuice]]\r\n* [[Beetlejuice (Cartoon)]]\r\n* [[Beetlejuice (musical)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ビートルジュース"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":214553,"created_at":"2024-11-01T09:08:01.115-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-01T09:08:01.115-04:00","title":"barbara_maitland","body":"Barbara Maitland is a character in [[Beetlejuice]], she is the wife of [[Adam Maitland]] and a ghost who haunts the home of the Deetzes.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149736,"created_at":"2022-09-04T10:09:22.001-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-01T09:06:37.224-04:00","title":"betelgeuse_(beetlejuice)","body":"Beetlejuice (also known as Betelgeuse) is a mischievous [[ghost]].

Their weapon of choice is the [[spiked club]], particularly the [[kanabou]].

On this day it is tradition to throw roasted soybeans in order to drive away oni; this practice is known as [[mamemaki]].\r\n\r\nTypical examples of oni are [[Lum]], [[Gedomaru]], [[Ibuki Suika]] and [[Hoshiguma Yuugi]].\r\n\r\nh4.

In it, a workman dropped his [[axe]] into the [[river]] (or a [[lake]] or [[pond]] depending on the variations). The god [[Hermes (mythology)|]] found out what was wrong, and offered his aid. First Hermes pulled out a silver axe, and asked whether it was the one the workman lost. He told the god that no, it wasn't. Then Hermes pulled out a golden axe, and asked whether it was his. Again, the workman said no. Finally, Hermes pulled out the original axe, and asked if it was his. The workman said that yes it was his. As a reward for his honesty, Hermes gave him all three axes.\r\n\r\nAnother workman, hearing of this, purposefully drops his axe into the river. He claims it was the golden axe, and ends up not getting any of them, not even his original axe.\r\n\r\nThis story appears to have become a common part of Japanese culture, with Mercury replaced by a \"water sprite\" or some such. It is often parodied, including in an episode of [[Doraemon]] featuring a gadget called the \"Woodcutter's Pond\" which functions similarly to the fable.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Kirei na Gian]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["金の斧","金の斧銀の斧"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":151107,"created_at":"2022-09-27T19:25:32.910-04:00","updated_at":"2024-10-28T19:03:38.497-04:00","title":"mokke_(jibaku_shounen_hanako-kun)","body":"Rabbit-like fantasy [[creature]]s from  [[Jibaku Shounen Hanako-Kun]].
