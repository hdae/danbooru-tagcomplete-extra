Since then, the Sidewinder has proved to be an enduring international success, and its latest variants remain standard equipment in most western-aligned air forces. The [[Soviet]] [[K-13 Vympel]], a reverse-engineered copy of the AIM-9, was also widely adopted by a number of nations.\r\n\r\nThe Sidewinder is the most widely used air-to-air missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the U.S. and 27 other nations, of which perhaps one percent have been used in combat. It has been built under license by some other nations including [[Sweden]], and can even be equipped by [[helicopter]]s, such as the Bell AH-1Z Viper. The AIM-9 is one of the oldest, lowest cost, and most successful [[air-to-air missile]]s, with an estimated 270 [[aircraft]] kills in its history of use. When firing a Sidewinder, NATO pilots use the brevity code \"FOX-2\".\r\n\r\nh4.

Simplified: 春丽) is a character in the [[Street Fighter]] series by [[Capcom]]. She is the first female playable character to appear in a 1-on-1 fighting game.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in [[Street Fighter II (series)|]], Chun-Li was the youngest member of the roster and only female character in the game, the self-proclaimed \"strongest woman in the world,\" and while not as physically powerful as the other characters, she was by far the quickest. Her most famous attack is the [i]Hyakuretsukyaku[/i] (\"Hundred Crack Legs\", alternately known as \"Lightning Legs\"), where she repeatedly kicks her opponent from a tilted standing position with incredible speed.\r\n\r\nIn the Street Fighter series, Chun-Li was an Interpol investigator from [[China]] who had been searching for clues to the recent death of her father. Getting into a friendly spar with an old teacher of hers and friend of her father, [[Gen (street fighter)|]], he gives her a lead into who may have killed her father—the mysterious crime syndicate Shadaloo and its tyrannical leader [[M. Bison]]. After an encounter where M. Bison confirms he slew her father, a tearful Chun-Li swore vengeance and made it her life's mission to destroy Shadaloo and bring M. Bison to justice. She collaborated closely with [[Guile]], [[Cammy White]], [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|]], and the other World Warriors throughout the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter M. Bison's supposedly final death during [[Street Fighter V]], her mission complete, Chun-Li retired from Interpol and opened an orphanage to live a quieter life. The most famous of her young wards - practically her adopted daughter - is [[Li-Fen]].\r\n\r\nChun-Li is one of Capcom's most popular characters and one of the most important females in video game history, appearing in numerous cross-overs and promotions. Her oldest and arguably greatest cross-company rival is [[SNK]]'s [[Fatal Fury]]'s [[Shiranui Mai|Mai Shiranui]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Adherents of Christianity believe Jesus was the 'begotten Son of God' who became man, [[crucifixion|sacrificed himself on the cross]] to 'cleanse' mankind of its sins, was resurrected from the dead after three days, and ascended into Heaven. Some [[Mormonism|Mormons]] (a nontrinitarian restorationist sect) even believe that the ancient [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl (mythology)|]] was historically Jesus Christ, who visited America in ancient times.\r\n\r\nThis belief in Jesus' divinity is the major difference between Christianity and the other Abrahamic religions: [[Judaism]] believes him, at best, to be a rabbi (generally meaning \"teacher\"), while [[Islam]] believes him to be a prophet sent by God, but explicitly do not believe Jesus to be a divine figure.\r\n\r\nCertain anime and manga series occasionally add their own interpretations of Jesus.

Consult the [[help:cheatsheet|cheat sheet]] for a full guide on searching posts. See the [[tag groups]] for existing tags.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging guidelines\r\n\r\nWhen you're tagging a post, use the following guidelines:\r\n\r\nh6. Replace spaces with underscores\r\n\r\nFor example, [code]maria-sama ga miteru[/code] becomes [code]maria-sama_ga_miteru[/code]. Spaces are used to separate tags.\r\n\r\nh6. Character names\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat complicated. In general, use whatever order the source material uses. Failing this, use the ordering the character's nationality suggests. This typically means LastName FirstName order for Asian names, and FirstName LastName order for Western names (except for Hungarians in many cases)\r\n\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some characters use FirstName LastName order despite having Asian-sounding names. [[Subaru Nakajima]] is a good example of this (in all official promotional artwork FirstName LastName order is used). There is nothing we can do but shake our heads.\r\n\r\nSome characters have a mixture of Asian and Western names. Refer to the source material for these cases. Failing that, the general rule is, use whatever ordering the character's last name suggests. Asuka Langley Souryuu has a Japanese last name, so it would become [[Souryuu Asuka Langley]]. Akira Ferrari has an Italian last name, so it becomes [[Akira Ferrari]]. But again, there are exceptions to this, like [[Setsuna F. Seiei]].\r\n\r\nh6. Full Names\r\n\r\nUsing full names reduces the chances of collisions.\r\n\r\nh6#restrictions. Tag name restrictions\r\n\r\n* Must not be blank, i.e. must contain at least one character\r\n* Cannot contain any asterisks ( * ) or commas ( , )\r\n* Cannot begin with a tilde ( ~ ) or dash ( - )\r\n* Cannot begin or end with an underscore ( _ ), or contain consecutive underscores\r\n* Must contain only printable characters\r\n** [code]!\"#$%&'()+-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~[/code]\r\n* Cannot begin with a metatag and \":\"\r\n** Example: [code]pool:test[/code]\r\n** See \"List of available metatags\":[/wiki_pages/help:cheatsheet.html#dtext-n4]\r\n* \"new\" and \"search\" are reserved and cannot be used\r\n* [b]*_(cosplay)[/b] tags must have an existing character tag\r\n** E.g. [b]chen_(cosplay)[/b] must have a [b]chen[/b] tag\r\n\r\nh6. Ask\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure whether a tag is right or wrong, then ask for help in topic #12251 (\"How do I tag this?\").\r\n\r\nh4. Tag categories\r\n\r\nThere are five types of tags: artist, character, copyright, general, and meta. Artist tags are red, characters are green, copyrights are purple, general tags are blue, and meta tags are orange.\r\n\r\nh6. Artist\r\n\r\nArtist tags identify the creator of a post. This doesn't mean the creator of the original copyrighted artwork. For example, you wouldn't use the [[Barasui]] tag on a picture of [[Matsuoka Miu]] drawn by [[Naruko Hanaharu]].\r\n\r\nArtist names should follow the guidelines in [[howto:romanize]]. Ask in topic #8199 (\"Artist tagging help\") if you need help creating an artist tag.\r\n\r\nh6. Character\r\n\r\nCharacter tags identify the characters in the post. Remember that Danbooru uses LastName_FirstName ordering.\r\n\r\nh6. Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright tags identify the anime, manga, game, or novel that the post is associated with. More generally, copyright tags identify the source material that the characters are from.\r\n\r\nCopyright tags should not be used for trademarks or brand names. A rule of thumb: if something doesn't have characters, it probably shouldn't be a copyright tag.\r\n\r\nh6. [[help:metatags|Meta]]\r\n\r\nMeta tags generally describe things beyond the content of the image itself. Examples include [[translated]], [[copyright request]], [[duplicate]], [[image sample]], and [[bad id]].\r\n\r\nh6. General\r\n\r\nGeneral tags are used for everything else. General tags should objectively describe the contents of the post. Don't use [[tag group:subjective|subjective tags]] which can be biased by personal preferences (e.g. [[cute]] or [[sexy]]), and don't tag things based on outside knowledge rather than what one can see in the post.\r\n\r\nh6#changing-tag-categories. Changing tag categories\r\n\r\nYou can change the category of the tag by prefixing it with [code]artist:[/code], [code]character:[/code], [code]copyright:[/code], [code]meta:[/code], or [code]general:[/code] when tagging a post. For example, tagging a post with [code]artist:sakura[/code] would change the [[sakura]] tag to an artist tag.\r\n\r\n [code]art:[/code], [code]char:[/code], [code]copy:[/code] are shortcuts for these prefixes.\r\n\r\nYou can also search the \"Tags\":[/tags] listing and use the \"edit\" link next to the tag to change its category.\r\n\r\nTags with between 50 and 1000 posts can only have their category changed by Builders. Category changes for above 1000 posts can be done by Admins, though any large changes should be discussed on the forum first. Make a \"bulk update request\":/bulk_update_requests/new to create a forum topic requesting that a tag category be changed.\r\n\r\nh4.

She later went rogue after her encounter with [[Dhalsim]] nullified Bison's Psycho Powered mind control. As of [[Street Fighter II (series)|]] onward to the present in [[Street Fighter 6]], she serves as a member of Delta Red, a British special forces unit with connections to MI6. She has made it her personal mission to locate, rescue, and rehabilitate the Dolls. She collaborates closely with most of the other World Warriors on her assignments, notably [[Chun-Li]].\r\n\r\nTrained extensively in close-quarters combat, Cammy likes to strike with quick, sharp attacks like a stinging bee (hence her codename) and use takedowns to immobilize and cripple her foes. Her signature techniques include the [i]Spiral Arrow[/i] and [i]Cannon Spike/Strike[/i] - both flying kick attacks that send Cammy lunging feet first at sharp angles, whether straight forward, up into the sky, or down from the air - as well as the [i]Hooligan Combination[/i], where she hurls herself into close quarters to either grapple the opponent to the ground or strike from odd angles.\r\n\r\nShe has two well known appearances depending on the Street Fighter timeline, although both have her wearing some manner of [[highleg leotard]] and red gauntlet-like gloves, sporting long [[blonde hair|blonde]] [[twin braids]], and showing off a long [[scar]] on her left cheek.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her default hairstyle is a [[bob cut]] with a monocle [[hair ornament]].\r\n\r\nDespite being called \"the most normal-looking\" and \"oddball\" out of the other [[HoloMyth]] debut (due to her not being a monster girl), she is actually the most chaotic of the bunch.

She also has a pet cat named [[Wellington (watson amelia)|]].\r\n\r\nDue to their frequent collaborations and chemistry both in videos and on Twitter, it is common to see her coupled with [[Gawr Gura]], a ship known as \"AmeSame\". Fans were quick to also compare her to [[Akai Haato]] due to their similar chaotic nature, which extends to collabs.\r\n\r\nShe reached one million subscribers on February 11 (JST) / 10 (PST) 2021.\r\n\r\nHer general activities ended on September 30th, 2024, but she did not fully \"graduate\" and is still affiliated with Cover Corp, participating in future projects.\r\n\r\nh4.

The Dark Souls series is the spiritual successor to [[Demon's Souls]].\r\n\r\nDark Souls takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a pilgrimage to discover the fate of their kind. The player fights against knights, dragons, phantoms, demons, and other monstrous or supernatural entities. The accretion, loss, and recovery of souls are central to the narrative and gameplay of Dark Souls games. These games are linked through their setting and an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire. At the end of each game, characters may reignite the \"first flame\" or allow it to fade, recurring a choice others have made before.\r\n\r\nh4.
