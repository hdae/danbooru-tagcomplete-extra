The complete vehicle was 10.2 metres (33 ft 6 in) long, 3.71 metres (12 ft 2 in) wide and 3.63 metres (11.9 ft) high. Weighing 188 metric tons, the Maus's main armament was the Krupp-designed 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, based on the 12.8 cm Pak 44 anti-tank field artillery piece also used in the casemate-type [[Jagdtiger]] tank destroyer, with a coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun. The 128 mm gun was powerful enough to destroy all Allied armored fighting vehicles then in service, some at ranges exceeding 3,500 metres (3,800 yd).\r\n\r\nHowever, the vehicle's extreme weight meant that it was ridiculously slow and impractical, being a perfect target for bombing runs by aircraft. In addition, it was a logistical nightmare, needing absurd amounts of fuel and being difficult to maintain and repair. If fielded in large numbers, it would most likely not have had any significant effect on the war effort due to its complete unsuitability for the mobile, air-dominated battlefield. Only two prototypes were constructed, the first of which did not have an actual turret. The second prototype had its hull destroyed by the Germans to prevent Russian forces from capturing it. The surviving Maus in Kublinka tank museum today is the turret from the second prototype on the hull of the first prototype.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[List of Ground Vehicles]]\r\n\r\nh4.

When Betsy was captured by the Mandarin, she ended switching bodies with a Japanese ninja mutant named Kwannon, which Betsy continue to use her codename Psylocke in her new Japanese body over 29 years. Eventually both Betsy and Kwannon switch back to their original bodies with Betsy becoming the new Captain Britain while Kwannon becomes the second Psylocke.\r\n\r\nA third Psylocke was introduced in Marvel's 2021 Demon Days mini comic series set in a Marvel universe that merged with Japanese mythology. This version of Psylocke is named [[Psylocke (sai)|Sai]], a wandering [[Samurai]] who hunts [[traditional youkai|Yokai]] with her psionic powers. The Psylocke Sai would later appear in the video game [[Marvel Rivals]].\r\n\r\nAs a result of her confusing backstory, Psylocke is either portrayed as British, Japanese or British Asian in other media.\r\n\r\nIn film, she appears in [[X-Men: The Last Stand]] and [[X-Men: Apocalypse]] in the [[X-Men film series]].

Her namesake (and namesake of the class) is Navy Admiral \"Frank Friday Fletcher (1855-1928)\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Friday_Fletcher], who served in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably as commander of naval forces at the \"Battle of Veracruz\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Veracruz] in Mexico. She is designed by [[Zeco]], who also illustrated the first of her class in the game, [[johnston (kancolle)|Johnston]].\r\n\r\nThe Fletcher class was the most numerous of the destroyers that participated in World War II, built completely free from any treaty restrictions with a larger size, larger fuel capacity and range, and better armaments. In the world of Kantai Collection, this translates to Fletcher and Johnston being tall and having ample bustlines; among the other non-Japanese destroyers before them, only [[tashkent (kancolle)|Tashkent]] is comparable in those areas while the others are implied to have flat chests.\r\n\r\nBeing the nameship of the class, Fletcher herself is given traits of [[long hair|long]] [[blonde hair]] with triangular [[double bun|side buns]], [[purple eyes]], and a [[large breasts|very well-endowed]] body. Her outfit is similar to Johnston's but with the black features being given lighter colors: a stylized [[serafuku]] which consists of an [[off shoulder|off-shoulder]] [[blue shirt]] with a [[white sailor collar]] that exposes her [[cleavage]], a [[yellow neckerchief]], and a short [[white skirt|white]] [[pleated skirt]], along with [[white thighhighs]] that are shielded by what seem to be metallic thigh and [[shin guards]] and red [[rudder footwear|rudder shoes]]. She also wears [[white gloves|white short gloves]] and a metallic [[hairband]]. In her remodeled form, she adds a [[star hair ornament]] to each side of her hairband.\r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] consists of two [[smokestack]]s and two 5-inch [[cannon]] [[ship turret]]s with one set on each side of her rigging. Her hull number is emblazoned on each side of her lower rigs. She also carries a [[cargo net]], a reference to her rescuing many survivors of the USS [i][[Northampton (kancolle)|]][/i] during the \"Battle of Tassafaronga\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tassafaronga] by using cork-floated cargo nets.\r\n\r\nOn her [[Fletcher Kai (kancolle)|Kai remodel]], Fletcher gains a silver [[star hair ornament]] on each side of her hairband, and her rigging gains an additional radar set atop the director and loses its blue camoflage in favor of standard grey color.\r\n\r\nFletcher is the first non-Japanese destroyer in the game to get a second remodel, and winds up with [i]two[/i] [[Fletcher Mk II (kancolle)|reversible modes]]. In both of them, she loses the cargo net and gains a pair of [[headphones]]. One of the modes gives her a quintuple torpedo launcher to carry, while the other completely redoes her rigging, giving her experimental ASW equipment to carry, making her headband more angular (mimicking the changed shape of her bridge), and changing the color of her skirt and thighhighs from white to black.\r\n\r\nh4.

She is given a remodel which trades the clock face for a radar antenna atop the mast, paints her wooden deck grey and modernizes her secondary and anti-aircraft guns.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe historical USS [i]Colorado[/i] saw a long and active career that took her into both Atlantic and Pacific oceans. She participated in a number of fleet exercises in the inter-war years, and also briefly served in various tasks such as becoming a training ship, and even assisting in the search for Amelia Earhart. During WWII, [i]Colorado[/i] saw extensive action throughout the Pacific against the Japanese, being a constant presence in pre-invasion shelling and fire support actions from Tarawa all the way to Okinawa. For her service, the battleship was awarded seven battle stars. After the war, she participated in \"Operation Magic Carpet\" to bring US troops back home. She was decommissioned in 1947 and sold for scrap in 1959.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nShe is named after the state of Colorado, the second such ship in the US Navy but the third to carry the name (the first USS [i]Colorado[/i], a steam screw frigate, was named after the Colorado River).\r\n\r\nShe is the first foreign shipgirl as well as the first personified battleship for her artist [[Parsley-f]]. She is also the fourth (second foreign) member of the so-called Big 7 (the seven battleships with 16-inch guns built before WWII) in the game, joining [[nagato (kancolle)|Nagato]], [[mutsu (kancolle)|Mutsu]], and [[nelson (kancolle)|Nelson]].\r\n\r\nIn comparison to the other Big 7 in the game, she is given a petite body and a more youthful appearance, reflecting the fact the Colorado-class battleships were the shortest of the Big 7 at 624 feet 3 inches (190.27 m) each, compared to the Nagato-class at 708 feet (215.8 m; later lengthened to 738 feet/224.94 m) each and the Nelson-class at 710 feet (216.4 m) each.

It is currently available exclusively in Japanese, though it has started to introduce some English-language graphical assets, and accessing the game for non-Japanese players requiring unconventional means.\r\n\r\nh4. Gameplay\r\n\r\nGameplay is centered upon building squadrons composed of individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. The player takes on the role of an [[Admiral (kancolle)|]] (提督 [i]teitoku[/i]) and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing.\r\n\r\nEach of the characters are moe [[personification]]s of [[World War II]] naval [[warship]]s, which are depicted as cute girls known as \"ship girls\" (艦娘, [i]kanmusu[/i]). These personified warships are based on real life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real life vessel.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the roster of the shipgirls was designed to be limited to the IJN and major players of the Imperial Japanese Army, and its final mission being an attack on the base, akin to how World War 2 played out for Japan. Due to the game's popularity, it has since introduced shipgirls from other Axis nations and wartime rival factions, including ships from the U.S. Navy, the British Royal Navy and even the somewhat-neutral Swedish Navy. \r\n\r\nAs of early 2022, KanColle features ships from following navies: Imperial Japanese Navy, Imperial Japanese Army, Maritime Safety Agency/Japan Coast Guard, United States Navy, British Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Dutch Koninklijke Marine, French Marine nationale, Italian Regia Marina, German Kriegsmarine, Военно-морской флот СССР, Swedish Svenska marinen, and Republic of China Navy. With the most numerous non-Japanese navies being United States Navy and Regia Marina.\r\n\r\nh4. Media\r\n\r\nThe game has developed into a much larger media franchise; various media including multiple manga series and light novels have been released, in addition to an officially licensed [[tabletop rpg|tabletop role-playing game]]. A [[PlayStation Vita]] game was released February 2016. A [[Kantai Collection (anime)|television anime adaptation]] aired Winter 2015, with a sequel season airing in 2022, and an anime movie was released in 2016. There is also a Japan only 3D arcade game [[Kancolle Arcade]] that was released in 2016.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe web browser game was launched on April 23, 2013, originally designed to run in Adobe Flash. An Android app version was released on August 1st, 2016. As of January 2015, the game had 2.5 million registered players. The game migrated to HTML5 prior to worldwide decommissioning of Adobe Flash in browsers.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging\r\n\r\nDon't tag shipgirls with [[mecha musume]], [[personification]],  [[World War II]], or [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], unless these things are present outside of the shipgirls themselves.\r\n\r\nDon't tag shipgirls of the same class as [[sisters]].\r\n\r\nh4.

HOOOOOOO.....!!!!![/i] - Lion-O, Lord of the ThunderCats.\r\n\r\n[i][b]ThunderCats[/b][/i] is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[Furry]] animated television series that was produced by Rankin/Bass Productions debuting in 1985, based on the characters created by Tobin \"Ted\" Wolf. It was originally intended as an attempt to profit from the success of previous similar shows like [[Masters of the Universe]].\r\n\r\nThe series follows the adventures of a group of catlike humanoid aliens with super powers. \r\n\r\nThe cartoon, for which Leonard Starr was the head writer, became extremely popular and lasted 4 seasons. The animation for the episodes is notable because it actually was provided by the Japanese studio Pacific Animation Corporation, later acquired in 1989 to form Walt Disney Animation Japan. Thus the animation was made in an 80s anime style.\r\n\r\nThe series was originally distributed by Rankin-Bass Productions' then-parent company Telepictures Corporation, which would later merge with Lorimar Productions in 1986. In 1989 Lorimar-Telepictures was purchased by Warner Bros, who has owned the rights for the series since then.\r\n\r\nThere were also several comic book series produced: A [[Marvel]] Comics' version (currently owned by Warner Bros. rival Disney), 1984 to 1988; and five series by Wildstorm, an imprint of DC Comics (Warner Bros.' corporate sibling), beginning in 2003. Items of clothing featuring the ThunderCats logo and DVD boxsets of the original series have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years as nostalgia for the former children's favorite has grown.\r\n\r\nA remake of the original ThunderCats animated series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and began airing on Cartoon Network from July 2011. Animation production was being done by Japanese animation company Studio 4°C. Despite an early positive response the new series was cancelled after only one season because of low ratings.\r\n\r\nh4.
