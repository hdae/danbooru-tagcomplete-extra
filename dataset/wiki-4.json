Identification\r\n\r\nSigns that something may be AI-generated:\r\n\r\n* Anything in {{width:512 height:768|512×768}} or {{width:768 height:512|768×512}} resolution. This is a very common resolution for Stable Diffusion 1.5-based models, and it is rarely used by humans.\r\n** Anything in {{width:832 height:1216|832×1216}} or {{width:1216 height:832|1216×832}} resolution. This is a very common resolution for Stable Diffusion XL-based models.\r\n* High quality art in low resolution, less than 1000×1000. Older AI generators are restricted to low resolutions, whereas skilled artists normally use much higher resolutions. AI art may be [[upscaled]] to higher resolution, but this can produce artifacts. \r\n** Newer models are capable of higher resolution, such as NovelAI starting at a free tier of 1024×1024.\r\n* EXIF metadata in the file indicating it is AI-generated. For example, AI prompts or model names. On the upload page, you can click the filesize beneath the image to see the EXIF metadata. Danbooru will automatically tag [[AI-generated]] after upload if the metadata indicates it is AI-generated.\r\n* A certain generic-looking art style with a generic background. This is typical of anime-styled images generated by NovelAI and Stable Diffusion. Browse {{AI-generated status:deleted}} to get a feel for this.\r\n* Abnormal/unusual mistakes within the artwork, such as:\r\n** [[Anatomical nonsense]], such as extra legs (post #5732513), fused fingers (post #5742855), fused legs (post #5735212), etc.\r\n** Strangely drawn objects/environments such as a book with it's cover as another layer of pages (post #5738243), wooden floor conforming with the shape of a character's hair (post #5850417), poor line continuity/object permanence when an object is hidden or goes behind other objects (post #5779922), etc.\r\n** Note that [[bad hands]] or other mistakes are not in themselves signs of AI-generation, as humans can make mistakes too. The errors made by AI tend to be completely illogical or physically impossible things that no human would draw.\r\n* A brand new artist pumping out improbably large volumes of high quality-looking art in a short period of time. This isn't automatically a sign of AI-generation, as sometimes new artists may release a pre-prepared portfolio of artwork to establish their presence.\r\n* An artist with an illogically drastic change in art style after early-October 2022 (around the time NovelAI became popular). This can easily be seen with artists with a low quality art style suddenly shifting into the generic-looking artstyle typical of NovelAI. Bear in mind that artstyles of skilled artists can evolve and improve over time.\r\n* No [[signature]], [[watermark]], or [[web address]]. Human artists often (but not always) sign their work, while AI works are often unsigned, as older AI models can't produce legible text, let alone realistic signatures. Do note however, that some AI artists may add a signature or watermark after the image is generated.\r\n* Mentions of \"AI\" or common AI generators such as \"Nijijourney,\" \"Midjourney,\" \"NovelAI,\" or \"Stable Diffusion\" in the tags or description of a post are a good place to start, but should not be used to automatically assume [[AI-generated|AI-generation]] (see below).\r\n** [b]Note:[/b] Artists frequently use AI keywords when prohibiting their work for its use, so be careful when making assumptions based on them.\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you are unsure whether a post is AI-generated or not, ask in topic #22285.\r\n\r\nh4.

He went to live with his uncle and aunt; Ben and May Parker, in Forest Hills, [[New York City]]. Parker was extremely bright and became a high honors student at Midtown High School. Parker's shyness and scholastic interest often made him a social outcast. \r\n\r\nWhile attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation, Peter was bitten by a spider which had been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration. Making his way home afterwards, Peter discovered he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls; spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, he was given his own [[tokusatsu]] [[spider-man (toei)|series]] in Japan where he had a [[mecha]] ([[Leopardon]]).\r\n\r\nOn [[Nijiura]], he shares a flat with [[Astaroth (Shinrabanshou)]], [[WE-tan]], and [[Yamada-san]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It was a third-generation console produced as a redesign and improvement of a previous console called the [[Sega SG-1000 II]]. It was capable of using regular [[game cartridge]]s as well as smaller-sized Sega Cards which held less memory, but quickly became unpopular in favor of cartridges.\r\n\r\nWhile having low sales in Japan and even less in the USA (and losing against the [[Nintendo]] [[Famicom]]/[[NES]] in those countries), the console proved extremely popular in Europe (with more than 6 million units purchased in the early 90s) and is still being sold in South America. \r\n\r\n[[Brazil]] is still the longest lasting market for the Master System. Tectoy, Sega's distributor in Brazil, is still responsible for marketing, sales and producing original games for it. Several different models of the console have been released in that country during the past decades. These are the Master System I, II, III (and a white colored relaunch version from the 2000s), the cordless Master System Compact, the pink Master System Girl, etc. All the existing [[Sega Game Gear]] games have been also ported to the system by Tectoy.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 and 2011, two variants of the Master System Evolution, a new console version successor to the Master System III that included 132 built-in games, were released only in Brazil. Another system called the Master System Portable which is a yellow gamepad with 30 built-in games has also been released recently by Tectoy.\r\n\r\nThe Sega Master System was succeded by the [[Sega Mega Drive]] in the early 80s.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[SEGA Light Phaser]]\r\n* [[List of game consoles]]\r\n* [[Tag Group:Video Game]]\r\n\r\nh4.External links\r\n\r\n* Wikipedia: \"Master System\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エスジー・セン","SG-1000"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50057,"created_at":"2013-11-03T21:32:24.244-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-15T22:10:28.590-05:00","title":"va-1ss","body":"A fictional transformable [[mecha]] from the [[MACROSS]] science fiction anime series. \r\n\r\nIt first appeared in the [[Macross 2]] OVA from 1992.\r\n\r\nThe [b]VA-1SS Metal Siren[/b] is an advanced and very powerful combat-capable prototype [[variable fighter]]. \r\n\r\nIt is armed with an experimental \"EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) anti-capital ship device\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse, missiles, and many energy weapons.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["VA-1SS"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30568,"created_at":"2011-11-30T13:03:07.851-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-15T21:27:55.154-05:00","title":"tag_group:artistic_license","body":"[See [[tag groups]].]\r\n\r\n[expand=Table of Contents]\r\n* 1. \"About\":#dtext-about\r\n* 2. \"Major changes\":#dtext-major\r\n* 3. \"Changes of the whole attire\":#dtext-whole_attire\r\n* 4. \"Changes of specific clothes or accessories\":#dtext-specific\r\n* 5. \"Changes of body parts other than hair and eyes\":#dtext-body\r\n* 6. \"Changes of hair\":#dtext-hair\r\n* 7. \"Changes of eyes\":#dtext-eyes\r\n* 8. \"Changes of personality and roles\":#dtext-pers_role\r\n* 9. \"Changes of overall colors\":#dtext-color\r\n* 10. \"Changes of age\":#dtext-age\r\n* 11. \"Other changes\":#dtext-other\r\n* 12. \"See also\":#dtext-see_also\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nThese are the possible changes fan artists make that differentiate their works from canon.\r\n\r\nh4#major.

Zenra fetish features people (usually women) participating in everyday tasks that they might otherwise perform clothed, such as casual scenes with participants playing in an all-nude orchestra in a seemingly oblivious state of mind towards their nudity.\r\n\r\nOthers incorporate the nudity on a more conscious level by doing such things as playing \"[[strip game|strip volleyball]]\", where the participants must remove clothing each time the other team scores a point. While in some case [[sex]] and sexual acts were treated as a normal recreational activity in the setting, including in public places.\r\n\r\nWhile very similar to [[exhibitionism]] and [[nudist|nudism]] in concept and often overlaps with each other, zenra fetish can be distinguished by how the setting treated nudity and sexual activity, as zenra fetish treats nudity either as a social norm at best and a minor inconvenience at worst. In addition, some zenra works also further emphasize sexual elements of the character (such as character exposing their private parts) as another form of beauty standard.\r\n\r\nPlease note that [[bathing]] or tanning on the beach are not zenra as that is normally done naked. In addition, since the word is used as a Pixiv tag for a [[completely nude]] character, only apply \"zenra\" tag if the setting is applicable.\r\n\r\nh6.
