It was first syndicated to American TV stations in 1985 and a few years later in several other countries across the world. It was quite popular during its first time of release in the West, as many anime fans of that era thought it was made of original content (which it wasn't).\r\n\r\nHistorically, [b]ROBOTECH has been an extremely polarizing subject amongst [[otaku|anime fans]], and it remains controversial even to this day[/b].\r\n\r\nMany critics look down upon the show for its extensive edits to the source material (Westernizing character names, editing for content, forging a connection between previously-unrelated series, and so on), to the extent that some of its most ardent detractors compare it to the Woody Allen film \"[i]What's Up, Tiger Lily?[/i]\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Tiger_Lily%3F, a Japanese spy thriller completely redubbed and re-edited to become a campy musical comedy.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the series does have its staunch defenders as well, most of whom will cite the fact that the adaptation had a new original epic and memorable music soundtrack and that it served as an important \"gateway\" to anime (particularly the [[mecha]] genre) for many Americans (and other Westerners) who grew up in the [[1980s (style)|80s]]. \r\n\r\nAfter several legal disputes over the international rights of the original series ([[MACROSS]] mostly) a settlement was reached between the parties in 2021 and now both the original and adapted series will be freely available everywhere in the world, allowing western anime fans to know more about the original franchises and the Japanese to watch the adaptation and purchase their respective merchandise without any legal constrains for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis tag should be used sparingly, and [i]only[/i] on pictures that are clearly intended to depict or reflect the ROBOTECH version of events. Otherwise, the tags for the original three series should instead be used:\r\n\r\n* [b]The Macross Saga[/b]: [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross]]\r\n* [b]The Masters Saga[/b]: [[Choujikuu Kidan Southern Cross]]\r\n* [b]The New Generation[/b]: [[Kikou Souseiki Mospeada]]\r\n\r\nAlso note that the American-produced anime film [[The Shadow Chronicles]] is considered part of the ROBOTECH universe, but not that of any of the original Japanese series.\r\n\r\nh4.

The vessel participated in America's involvement in [[World War I]] and helped evacuate American citizens and refugees fleeing the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 before being assigned to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn the opening minutes of the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], Oklahoma was targeted by Japanese torpedo bombers to devastating effect, hitting the vessel with five to eight [[torpedo]]es in almost as many minutes and causing her to roll over until the ship's superstructure dug into the bottom of the harbor. Salvage operations after the attack deemed the ship too badly damaged to be returned to service, making Oklahoma one of only two battleships permanently lost to the attack. \r\n\r\nOklahoma was officially decommissioned in 1944 and sold for scrap in 1946, but while being towed in 1947 from Hawaii to the scrapyard in California, Oklahoma and her tugs encountered a storm which swamped the hasty repairs to make the former battleship seaworthy.

After repairs were completed, Nevada served as naval fire support during the [[Invasion of Normandy]], and landings on [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Okinawa]], among others. \r\n\r\nAfter the war, Nevada was one of the vessels selected to serve in the 1946 [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll, and was painted bright orange to serve as the aim point target for Test Able, a bomb dropped from a [[B-29 Superfortress]]. Though Nevada survived both nuclear tests, she was heavily damaged and too heavily irradiated to be repaired. Nevada was decommissioned shortly after Operation Crossroads, and in 1948 was sunk as a naval gunfire exercise target from several ships, including [[USS Iowa (BB-61)]].\r\n\r\nThis tag is for depictions of the ship itself, as well as for personifications outside of established franchises. \r\n\r\nh4.

Generally considered a working-class dialect and is heavily associated with certain \"downtown\" wards of Tokyo located on the eastern side. This dialect is sometimes also called the Shitamachi dialect ([i]Shitamachi-kotoba[/i], lit. \"Downtown Speech\".)\r\n\r\nThe stereotypical phrase associated with this dialect is \"beranmee\" (corruption of \"beranbou\"), roughly meaning \"bloody fool\" or \"frickin' idiot\". Edoben is thus also sometimes called the [i]beranmee-kuchou[/i], or the \"Beranmee Accent\". Another common phrase is \"teyandee\", i.e. \"The [i]hell[/i] are ya sayin'?\"\r\n\r\nOther features of this dialect includes a lack of distinction between /shi/ and /hi/ (resulting in [i]shichi[/i] sounding like \"hichi\"), as well as \"fronting\" of /ju/ to /ji/ (this results in [i]juujutsu[/i] being pronounced like \"jiu-jitsu\"). The sounds of /ai ae ie oi/ also tends to be converted into a long /e/ sound, resulting in [i]taihen[/i] and [i]sugoi[/i] being pronounced as \"teehen\" and \"sugee\".\r\n\r\nCharacters of the \"edokko\" archetype (Rowdy Child of Edo/Tokyo) tend to speak with a distinctive Edoben accent. \r\n\r\nEdoben is usually adapted into a colloquial-sounding English in translations, with greater emphasis on use of contractions and other colloquialisms. On Danbooru, [i]heavier[/i] accents of Edoben are sometimes adapted into \"Cockney English\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney].\r\n\r\nh4.

The game initially included Generation I Pokemon, but began adding Generation II Pokemon in early 2017 and Generation III during the same year's Halloween event.\r\n\r\nThe game is often set as an example of a \"flavor of the month\" fad. Its online popularity dropped drastically a few months after its release; many blame this on the lack of updates and content on launch, Niantic, Inc.'s poor management and playerbase communication, and its freemium pay-to-win system prevalent in many other mobile games. However, despite the decrease in internet activity, it's still a popular game, and some cite the game and the release of [i][[pokemon sm|Pokemon Sun and Moon]][/i] as the causes of a resurgence in franchise popularity overall. More features being added over the course of 2017 have also drawn back some of the initial fans that dropped off for the above reasons.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 2025, Niantic sold Pokemon GO to Scopely, the makers of Monopoly Go!.\r\n\r\nh4.
