He was deciphered by the Guild Master of the Akihabara Creators and given an outer appearance and personality for interacting with the world at large. Specifically, in accordance with the preferences of the one he calls his creator, he's taken on the form of a mechanical Therian. His true form is immaterial, however, as Enigma's existence is comprised solely of data transmitted over the net. The upshot of this is that he's capable of self-reproducing with no limits beyond those of his own available resources, and each and every copy is individually customized and optimized for the service of a specific end user. This particular Enigma has been customized for use by the Guild Master of the Summoners, considering himself to be something of a secretary for his assigned master and adopting a vaguely condescending, highly intellectual persona in service to that end. The idea, it seems, is that he quite genuinely wishes to supplement the shortcomings of his master's ego, as calculated through careful observation and data-crunching, in order to prove his worth. This is very much in keeping with his self-proclaimed role, since the very word secretary is derived from secret, having long ago been used to refer to those who safeguarded the classified documents of the aristocracy—a term which perfectly and succinctly fits the identity of this cryptographic Enigma like a glove. There is one particular Transient who's quite taken with Enigma, being extremely fond of puzzles and quizzes.\r\n\r\nh4.

Back then when he was working while refusing to show his face he went by the name AmP, and even now the videos from then are floating around the deep web with tons of comments. After seeing an idol's live concert, Amduscias starting dreaming of singing as an idol himself. What if he started singing and dancing cutely with music that makes you want to shake your body? But since Amduscias thought his large frame was unshapely, he kept his wish close to his heart. Amduscias has regularly hid that part of himself from others with rugged fashion, but after meeting someone calling themselves his first fan he's taken a step towards fulfilling his dream. It's time he started climbing the road towards being Tokyo's top therian idol with his gorgeous outfit and signature pose! Lately you can find him at underground idol stages making obscure appearances. If you go and order the signed shirts or little instant cameras he's selling there, his eyes will shine in delight. He's getting impassioned coaching from a senpai that knows the harshness of the entertainment business and sees him as a diamond in the rough. Amduscias highly respects this senpai and is working hard to be good enough to stand on stage with him. \r\n\r\nh4.

It was Tomino's attempt to launch a new U.C. Gundam saga, set 30 years after [[Char's Counterattack]]. He re-teamed with character designer [[Yasuhiko Yoshikazu]] and [[mecha]] designer [[Ookawara Kunio]]  for the occasion.\r\n\r\nOriginally planned as a full-length television series, Gundam F91 hit a production snag due to staff disputes, and the project was stopped after the screenplays for the first thirteen episodes were written. It was then decided that what was made of the show would be condensed into a theatrical feature. The film was first released in [[Japan]] on March 16, 1991.\r\n\r\nSet in [b]U.C. 0123[/b] (44 years after [[mobile_suit_gundam|the original Gundam]]), the story of Gundam F91 revolves around teenage space colonist [[Seabook Arno]], his girlfriend [[Cecily Fairchild]], and the efforts of the [[Crossbone Vanguard]] militia to establish an aristocracy known as \"Cosmo Babylonia\". In keeping with Gundam tradition, the civilian Seabook is forced by circumstance to pilot the [[F91 Gundam]], coincidentally designed in part by his estranged mother, Dr. [[Monica Arno]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Tezuka Macoto, Tezuka Osamu's son, supervised the series, and Tezuka Productions is listed as having given cooperation.

Additional forms range from a paper rosette, ribbon bow, Father Christmas or Santa Claus, to a Christian cross, owl, white dove, spike, or sunburst.\r\n\r\nTree-toppers may be made of from a wide range of materials.

Both the Henschel and Porsche tanks were to be fitted with the same turret supplied by Krupp. The Porsche company worked on updating the VK3001P medium tank, Porsche's medium tank prototype, and adapted parts used on it for the new tank.\r\n\r\nThe new Porsche tank, designated the VK4501(P) was to be powered by twin air cooled gasoline Porsche Type 101/1 engines which were mounted to the rear of the tank. The twin engines would then drive two generators, one on either side of the tank, which would then power two motors which would drive the tracks. But the engine along with its drive system were very prone to break down and needed almost constant maintenance to keep the tank running. This and the tank being less maneuverable than its competitor was the reason why Henschel's prototype, the [[Tiger I]], was adopted for production instead.\r\n\r\nPorsche AG had already manufactured about one hundred chassis of the unsuccessful Porsche Tiger that were no longer required. It was therefore decided that the Porsche chassis were to be used as the basis of a new heavy tank destroyer (the [[Elefant]]), mounting Krupp's newly developed 88 mm Pak 43/2 anti-tank gun.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is based on the book [[Starship Troopers]] by Robert A. Heinlein that was published in 1959. \r\n\r\nThis anime production is considered by many the \"most faithful\" to the original novel's plot, despite the fact that many liberties were taken with the characters and the original book's themes. For instance [[Johnny Rico]], an [[Asian]] [[philippines|Filipino]] in the novel, is a [[blonde_hair|blonde]] White [[argentina|Argentine]] in the OVA. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, the main character's ethnicity in the OVA series has more in common with Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film than the source material — this despite their productions being wholly unrelated and having nearly a decade of difference. However, unlike the 1997 film, the most prominent link the anime has to the original book are the inclusion of [[power armor]] and drop pods that were absent in Verhoeven's film.\r\n\r\n[[Miyatake Kazutaka]] of Studio Nue originally designed the [[power suit]]s in the OVA for the Japanese edition of the 50s novel in the early 80s. The design also appeared uncredited in the [[Daicon III]] and [[Daicon IV]] fan made animated shorts in the early 80s, several years before the OVA was made.\r\n\r\nh4.

She is always calm and collected, shows loyalty to her colleagues while being guarded to everyone else, and is every bit as strict with others as she is with herself. However, if crossed in any way, she will stop at nothing to exact her revenge. She does not like sharing her thoughts with others, not even her friends. However, she is good friends with [[Sichte_Meister|Sichte Meister]], whom she holds the most dearly to. She often speaks in an old [[knight]] fashion and prefers to let her Grollschwert do the talking - in simple words, fighting first and asking questions later. She is the current posessor of Grollschwert, the previous being her grandfather.\r\n\r\nShe gets her own side game in the original game called Rosenkreuzstilette Grollschwert, where she plays a lot like [[Zero (mega man)|Zero]] from the [[Mega Man X (series)|]] and [[Mega Man Zero (series)|]] games. Her grandfather was a legendary war hero named [[Raimund Seyfarth]], who was known as Thanatos in his living days and, unbeknownst to her until she meets him at Graf Michael Sepperin's castle bridge in Grollschwert, was recently resurrected by Sepperin as a wraith resembling the [[grim_reaper|Grim Reaper]] (can also resemble [[death_(castlevania)|Death]] from [[Castlevania (series)|]]) and hired to guard the bridge. Ever since the events of the original game, she has taken up Raimund's Grollschwert to use later on, despite the fact that Raimund's spirit seems to be posessing it - therefore it seems to lead him to posess his own granddaughter every time she wields it.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":10982,"created_at":"2009-04-08T08:03:25.855-04:00","updated_at":"2023-11-16T20:31:54.800-05:00","title":"simon_belmont","body":"Protagonist of two [[Castlevania (series)|]] adventures (and numerous iterations of the former).
