There were sumptuary laws which regulated the wearing of Guan; however, these laws were not fixed; and thus, they would differ from dynasty to dynasty. There were various forms and types of Guan.\r\n\r\nAs the character Guan (冠) is of a homonym another Chinese character pronounced Guan (官) which literally means official; the Guan (冠) became the symbol of officials. Note, this should not be confused with [[futou]] which essentially replaced the Guan as Chinese court wear around the [[Tang dynasty]] (but continued to be worn by Confucian literati until the [[Ming dynasty]], where it became the exclusive headwear of the royal family).\r\n\r\nh4.

She is the first [[Korea|Korean]] character in the Street Fighter series, and the only one that uses [[Taekwondo]] so far. She is voiced by [[Kitamura Eri]] in Japanese and Jessica Strauss in English.\r\n\r\nShe is described as being an \"evil, mean and nasty\" member of S.I.N. who is a main character in the SFIV storyline. The character was created by request of many Korean fans who wished for [[Capcom]] to add a Korean character in Street Fighter, something already established by [[SNK]] and [[Namco]]. \r\n\r\nShe is depicted as being overtly [[sadism|sadistic]] and often makes denigrating and [[sexually suggestive]] remarks toward her opponents. [spoiler]According to [[Menat]], this cruel demeanor is simply a facade to hide her emotional pain and suffering as a result of her traumatic experience after her parents were killed by [[m. bison|M.

Her creation is also seen as a rib to [[The King of Fighters]] as all the Korean characters in that franchise, particularly [[Kim Kaphwan]], are either representatives of Justice or evildoers who redeem themselves, while she is (at least initially) a servant of evil. \r\n\r\nh4.

Along with his aspirations for world conquest, M. Bison has been working on perfecting a lethal and deadly energy that will exponentially increase his fighting ability, an inherently evil energy he refers to as \"Psycho Power\".\r\n\r\nThroughout the series, M. Bison occasionally attempts to increase his power by transferring his energy form into an artificially created physical body, thus increasing the limit of Psycho Power he can posses. His attempts were usually thwarted due to either the protagonist's actions destroying his physical body, or that the intended new body rebelled against him. His most famous duplicate body is [[Cammy White]].\r\n\r\n[[Rose (Street Fighter)|]] is the other half of his soul, spiritually bound to him and wielding Psycho Power's opposite, Soul Power.\r\n\r\nThough he has made numerous enemies, his most persistent and personal of foes include [[Chun-Li]] and [[Guile]], both seeking to avenge the death of her father and his friend [[Charlie Nash]], respectively.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering a supposedly final death in [[Street Fighter V]], he mysteriously returned in [[Street Fighter 6]] in a weakened amnesiac form.\r\n\r\nh4.
