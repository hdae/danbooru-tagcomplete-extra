Frequently, she can be made to appear thuggish instead of smirking.  Plasma-chan is also a highly violent \"dark-side\" version of Inazuma, usually threatening people (or eggplants) with weapons or martial arts (see post #1726517). Alternately, simply behaving in a manner deliberately the opposite of the \"pure and innocent\" normal Inazuma (see post #1703511).\r\n\r\nPlasma-chan was, in the Twitter images that originated her meme, violently opposed to an artist named [[Nasu (tenpurakkusu)|]] (Japanese for \"[[eggplant]]\") and featured the [[solid circle eyes]] and [[diamond mouth]] face as her salient traits in the series.
