There are three extant species.\r\n\r\nIdentify cassowaries by the prominent bony casque (crest), fluffy body covered in dark hair-like feathers, large strong legs, and bare, typically blue, head and neck. The beak and legs are usually grey. The Northern cassowary has a yellow-orange neck and blue head, while the Southern cassowary has a red wattle extending low on its blue neck. The flightless wings are typically not visible.\r\n\r\nThe Southern cassowary is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu.\r\n\r\nCassowaries feed mainly on fruit, although all species are omnivorous and will take a range of other plant food, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Though wary of humans, when provoked they are capable of inflicting serious injuries, including fatal, to both dogs and people. It has been labeled \"the world's most dangerous bird.\"\r\n\r\nh4.
