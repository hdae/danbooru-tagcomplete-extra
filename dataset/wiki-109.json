It was the first successful semi-automatic shotgun design, and remained in production until 1998.\r\n\r\nIt was the first mass-produced semi-automatic shotgun. Designed in 1898 and patented in 1900, it was produced continually for almost 100 years by several makers with production ending in 1998. It features a distinctive high rear end, earning it the nickname \"Humpback\". The top of the action goes straight back on a level with the barrel before cutting down sharply towards the buttstock. This distinctive feature makes it easy to identify A-5s from a distance. A-5s were produced in a variety of gauges, with 12 and 20 predominating; 16 gauge (not produced between 1976 and 1987) models were also available. The shotgun saw [[military]] service worldwide from [[World War I]] through the [[Vietnam War.]] The weapon was used heavily by members of the [[Special Air Service]] in the Malayan Emergency, who found the semi-automatic shotgun perfect for close quarter jungle fighting. \r\n\r\nh4.

It is located at the confluence of the rivers Rhône and Saône, 391 km southeast of [[Paris]], 278 km north of [[Marseille]], 113 km southwest of Geneva, and 50 km northeast of Saint-Étienne.\r\n\r\nThe city of Lyon proper had a population of 522,969 in 2019 within its small municipal territory of 48 km2, but together with its suburbs and exurbs the Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,280,845 that same year, the second most populated in France. Lyon and 58 suburban municipalities have formed since 2015 the Metropolis of Lyon, a directly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of most urban issues, with a population of 1,411,571 in 2019. Lyon is the prefecture of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region and seat of the Departmental Council of Rhône (whose jurisdiction, however, no longer extends over the Metropolis of Lyon since 2015).\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Gauls during the Roman Empire, Lyon is the seat of an archbishopric whose holder bears the title of Primate of the Gauls. Lyon became a major economic hub during the Renaissance. The city is recognised for its cuisine and gastronomy, as well as historical and architectural landmarks; as such, the districts of Old Lyon, the Fourvière hill, the Presqu'île and the slopes of the Croix-Rousse are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema since Auguste and Louis Lumière invented the cinematograph there. The city is also known for its light festival, the Fête des Lumières, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of \"Capital of Lights\". \r\n\r\nh4.

(abbreviated as ずとまよ ZUTOMAYO) is a Japanese rock group that debuted in 2018. Secretive by nature, the group never released a full member list, crediting different people for music, arrangements, and music video production each time. The only reoccurring member is the vocalist: an unidentified woman named \"ACA-Ne\" (ACAね), pronounced \"Akane\".\r\n\r\nh4. See Also\r\n\r\n* [[Nira-chan]]\r\n\r\nh4.

It is also called NSPUM (НСПУМ) or NSPU-1. The scope was introduced into Soviet [[military]] service in the early 1970s and is still used by many of the Soviet Union's successor states, and has been used in numerous armed conflicts around the world.\r\n\r\nThe 1PN58 gathers light into a refractor which can be protected with an aperture cover. The center of the cover has a circular aperture with dark glass allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier. For zeroing the sight the left side of the scope has two perpendicular knobs, of which the elevation knob has a detachable scale. The scope comes with seven different, detachable elevation scales, one for each of the supported weapons. Its magnification power is 3.5×.\r\n\r\nAny [[weapon]] fitted with the Soviet-style dovetail mount can technically use this optic. The following weapons can use the 1PN58, such as:\r\n* [[AKM]]\r\n* [[AK-74]]\r\n* AK-100 series \r\n* [[AS Val]]\r\n* [[Dragunov SVD]] and SVDK\r\n* [[PKM]]\r\n* [[PSL Romak]]\r\n* [[RPG-7]]\r\n* [[RPK-74]] and RPK-74M\r\n* [[VSS Vintorez]]\r\n* [[Zastava M76]]\r\n\r\nh4.

It is performed from a back mount single vine ride position, where the top man has one \"hook\" threaded through the bottom man's legs and secured behind the ankle.

In the meantime, the Malaysian Armed Forces expressed interest in using the rifle and by 2007 openly stated its intention to purchase the XM8 rifle.

Snake Eater was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and published by [[Konami]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], and was released on November 17, 2004 in North America; December 16, 2004 in Japan; March 4, 2005 in Europe; and on March 17, 2005 in Australia. \r\n\r\nThe game, which serves as a prequel to the entire [[Metal Gear (series)|]] series, was followed by two direct sequels titled [[Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops]] and [[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]].\r\n\r\nSet in the Cold War era [[Soviet]] Union, the story centers on FOX operative Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a weapons designer and sabotage an experimental superweapon. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 60s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor.

With the same arm, they reach around the ankle and through the opening formed by the legs, and lock their hands together. The wrestler then steps over his opponent, turning the opponent over as in a [[scorpion deathlock]] or a [[boston crab]] and proceeds to squat and lean back.\r\n\r\nIt is also known as just the [i]Cloverleaf[/i], or [i]Texas Cloverhold[/i] in Japan.

The late wrestling legend [[Eddie Guerrero]] has a variation of the Texas Cloverleaf where he performs the maneuver from a standing position, which enabled him to pull the opponent's legs up high enough to where he could add pressure to the hold by sticking one of his knees into the other wrestler's back. Guerrero referred to the move as the [i]Lasso from El Paso[/i], making reference to his hometown of El Paso, Texas.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["テキサスクローバーホールド","クローバーホールド"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":7166,"created_at":"2008-04-21T15:09:06.259-04:00","updated_at":"2022-12-10T22:49:39.590-05:00","title":"kakifly","body":"Artist.\r\nCreator of [i][[K-On!]][/i]\r\n\r\nJapanese name: かきふらい","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":154445,"created_at":"2022-12-10T20:35:49.912-05:00","updated_at":"2022-12-10T20:35:49.912-05:00","title":"wo-chien","body":"A dual-type Dark/Grass Legendary Pokémon introduced in [[pokemon sv|Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]].\r\n\r\nh4.
