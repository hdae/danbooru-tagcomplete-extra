They are usually the main antagonists in the fictional universe of [[Transformers]]. \r\n\r\nThese villainous transforming [[robot]]s can take many forms, and have many different origins and stories across the numerous different Transformers media, but in almost all incarnations, they are led by [[Megatron]]. They are typically represented by the purple facial insignia they all wear. Primarily, [b]Decepticons[/b] have red eyes, while their enemy [[Autobot]]s have blue eyes. They are usually known for their air power, especially since many of them turn into [[aircraft]]. Decepticons often turn into [[military]] vehicles, construction vehicles, and even smaller-than-human-sized objects. \r\n\r\nIn [[Japan]]'s version of the franchise, the Decepticons are called [b]Destron[/b] or [b]Deathtron[/b] (Japanese: デストロン Desutoron). The one exception to this naming convention is Car Robots, where the sub-group referred to as \"Decepticons\" in the Robots in Disguise adaptation, is known in Japan as the Combatrons (the Japanese name of the G1 subgroup known as the Combaticons). The overall name of the Robots in Disguise villain faction is [b]Destronger[/b]. However, the Japanese version of Transformers Animated uses Decepticon (ディセプティコン). \r\n\r\nThe title Decepticons is derived from the word [i]\"deception\"[/i] in the English language. \r\n\r\nh4.Known Decepticons \r\n\r\n* [[Megatron]] \r\n* [[Galvatron]] \r\n* [[Cyclonus]] \r\n* [[Shockwave (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Starscream]] \r\n* [[Slipstream (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Skywarp]] \r\n* [[Thundercracker]] \r\n* [[Ramjet]] \r\n* [[Sunstorm (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Acidstorm (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Thunderblast]] \r\n* [[Soundwave (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Soundblaster]] \r\n* [[Laserbeak]] \r\n* [[Buzzsaw (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Rumble (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Ravage (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Frenzy (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Ratbat (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Blitzwing]] \r\n* [[Astrotrain]] \r\n* [[Bombshell (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Shrapnel (transformers)|]]\r\n* [[Kickback (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Blackarachnia]] \r\n* [[Lockdown (Transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Barricade (Transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Blackout (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Lugnut (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Bruticus]] \r\n** [[Swindle (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Brawl (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Onslaught (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Blast Off (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Vortex (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Leozack]] \r\n* [[Knockout (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Eagle Eye (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Terrorsaur]] \r\n* [[Ransack (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Devastator (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[scrapper_(transformers)|Scrapper]]\r\n** [[Mixmaster]]\r\n** [[Bonecrusher]]\r\n** [[hook_(transformers)|Hook]]\r\n** [[scavenger_(transformers)|Scavenger]]\r\n** [[long_haul_(transformers)|Long Haul]]\r\n* [[Unicron]] \r\n* [[Trypticon]] \r\n* [[Tarn]]\r\n* [[Overlord (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Snare (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Sixshot (transformers)|]]\r\n* [[Battleslash]]\r\n* [[Roadtrap (transformers)|]]\r\n* [[viper_(transformers)|Viper]]\r\n\r\nh4.

They are typically represented by the red facial insignia they all wear. Primarily, Autobots have blue eyes, while their enemy Decepticons have red eyes. \r\n\r\nAutobots often turn into regular cars, trucks, or other road vehicles but some are aircraft, military vehicles, communication devices, weapons, and cyborg animals. Some can even transform into humans; they'd be classified as pretenders. Most of the Autobot groups' names have the suffix \"-bot\" in them. \r\n\r\nIn [[Japan]], the Autobots are called [b]Cybertrons[/b] (サイバトロン, Saibatoron?) except in the live-action film series and Transformers Animated, where they are referred to as Autobots (オートボット, Ōtobotto?). The [i]Maximals[/i] from Transformers: Beast Wars are also known as Cybertrons in Japan, but in North America they are called Maximals and are descendants of the Autobots. In [[Italy]], they are called [b]Autorobots[/b].

Its armaments include a modular [[gunpod]], [[laser]] cannons and several different types of [[missile]]s. It can be equipped with modular attachments such as [[reactive armor]] and external fuel/thruster packs.\r\n\r\nThanks to its FF-2001 thermonuclear engines it can fly in both an atmosphere and outer [[space]]. The VF-1 [[variable fighter]] can also transform into fighter, [[gerwalk]] and [[battroid]] (giant robot) modes.\r\n\r\nThere are several different variants of the fighter, called [[VF-1A]], [[VF-1J]], [[VF-1D]], [[VF-1S]], [[VF-1J Armored]], [[SDP-1 Stampede Valkyrie]], [[VE-1]], [[VT-1]], [[VT-1 Super]], [[VF-1 Super]] and [[VF-1 Strike]].\r\n\r\nIt first appeared in [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross]] (1982) where it was created by the [[U.N. Spacy]] to fight a race of humanoid alien [[giant]]s called [[Zentradi]]. It was eventually succeeded by the far more advanced [[VF-4]] [i]Lighting III[/i].\r\n\r\nIn [[real life]] the VF-1 was designed by [[Kawamori Shouji]] in the early [[1980s_(style)|80s]]. The design of the mecha's fighter mode is loosely based on the [[f-14_tomcat|F-14]] combat jet and its name is a tribute to the [[XB-70]], Kawamori's favorite aircraft.\r\n\r\nThis mecha was called the [b]VF-1 Veritech[/b] in the [[ROBOTECH]] American adaptation of Macross. In that continuity the mecha was developed from alien [i][[ZOR|Robotechnology]][/i] and the term VERITECH is an acronym which stands for [b]V[/b]ariable [b]E[/b]ngineering and [b]R[/b]obotics [b]I[/b]ntegration [b]TECH[/b]nology. \r\n\r\nh4.

Its task is to debug and maintain the virtual side of the city. Its secondary function is to seek out and disable illegal AR devices, software, and viruses, making it a menace to the characters of the series. Searchmaton can deploy up to four spherical drones to aid in its task. While Searchmaton can patrol the city streets freely, it is prohibited to enter private property such as houses, and other spaces such as temple grounds and schools, because they lie outside of the responsibility of Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration. The protagonists utilize this and other predictable aspects of Searchmaton's behavior to escape its grasp. Searchmaton, striking terror into the hearts of children, is ironically painted with a smiley face and punctuates its violent attacks with the cute catch phrase \"I'm Satchī!\" (僕サッチー boku Satchī?) which [[okonogi_yuuko|Yasako's]] father had a part in developing. [[harakawa_tamako|Tamako]] often hijacks Searchmatons for use as her personal digital henchmen. They are later replaced by the upgraded Searchmaton 2.0 in the form of cubes which have upgraded weapons and shielding, and can combine like the Q-chan to perform wide area re-formatting. Since the 2.0s are under government jurisdiction they can enter areas inaccessible to Satchī including shrines, and also private property when authorised.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)","is_locked":false,"other_names":["サッチー","サーチマトン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":118130,"created_at":"2020-11-07T16:42:20.650-05:00","updated_at":"2023-06-09T01:00:05.655-04:00","title":"mike_(drawingchisanne)","body":"[b][i]ミケ[/i][/b]\r\n\r\nA recurring character in [[chai (drawingchisanne)|]]'s artworks.
