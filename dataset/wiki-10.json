May also apply to male-to-[[futanari]], but since futanari is not wholly female, female-to-futanari may also qualify. A being with no sex depicted as any of these may technically count.\r\n\r\nThis tag can also be applied to an [[otoko no ko]] if the character is given female traits such as the presence of actual [[cleavage]] or the obvious absence of a [[bulge]] at the crotch. For [[reverse trap]]s, the absence of cleavage or presence of a bulge applies.\r\n\r\nIf a character is genderswapped often enough, the genderswapped version may be given its own name. For male-to-female genderswaps, this is often the normal character's name with \"ko\" appended to it. (Â≠ê \"Ko\" meaning \"child\" is a common ending for Japanese girls' names.) For female-to-male genderswaps, \"o\" is sometimes added. \r\n\r\nKnown in Internet circles as Rule 63, wherein there is a female or male version of any given male or female character, respectively.\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b] \r\n* If the person has only swapped bodies with another from the opposite sex, but the body itself has not changed, then use [[personality switch]] instead.\r\n* The \"Â•≥‰ΩìÂåñ\" tag may also on occasion be used to describe female [[personification]], rather than a genderswap.\r\n* If a character in canon is genderswapped but rarely shown in their original form (such as [[Mai Natsume]] or [[Tanya Degurechaff]]), the tag only applies if said original form is included or somehow alluded to.\r\n* For posts depicting a character undergoing the process of gender transition, use the tag [[gender transitioning]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The series is well known for its \"Arino's Challenge\" (ÊúâÈáé„ÅÆÊåëÊà¶Áä∂, [i]Arino no Chousenjou[/i]) segments, where Arino plays through and attempts to complete retro games with the help of his Assistant Directors and various other staff members.

[[Nintendo]] eventually released a parody of the series in 2015 on its Youtube page titled [i]Gamecenter DX[/i], which has Arino's co-star Hamaguchi Masaru as a manager playing games that haven't been released.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the series had a [[Nintendo DS]] game modeled after it: [i][[Gamecenter CX: Arino's Challenge]][/i], with a lot of the game's input coming directly from the show's staff. The game then got a sequel in 2009 and a [[Nintendo 3DS]] sequel in 2014.\r\n\r\nh4.
