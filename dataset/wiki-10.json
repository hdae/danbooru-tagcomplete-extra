From there, Doomguy began his quest to return to Earth and slayed many demons ranging from a pistol to a shotgun and a BFG-9000.\r\n\r\nDoomguy has a pet rabbit called Daisy, but this in turn began his rage when the demons killed the rabbit and continues slaying demons in Earth (as it continues in Thy Flesh Consumed, Episode 4 of the first game).\r\n\r\nIn Doom II, Doomguy rescues most of the civilians from earth in order to close Hell once and for all. The story continues from Doom 64 (whereas he chose to remain in Hell forever so no demons can enter Earth or Mars but this eventually failed due to \"The Lost Levels\" expansion, where he got teleported by the Sister Resurrector.) and the Modern era of Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal (Itself a remake of Doom II).\r\n\r\nh4.

Identifiable by her [[parted bangs]] and very pointy ears. Due to Parsee's outfit having many colors, she is put on a [b]C[/b]yan [b]B[/b]ackground compared to the more common blue or green background. Has a very husky voice that led her to play the more tomboyish roles and famous for being a bigger lesbian than [[Mars (cookie)|]]. Her dedication to voice acting as an amateur led to her being the breakout star of Nabe☆. Named herself after Joker in [[Danzai no Maria]]. \r\n\r\nStarted out initially unpopular as Nabe☆ was a failure. She was so unpopular that her unpopularity made her popular during the Unprecedented [[Majime-kun]] Boom of 2016, later getting grouped with [[Akanuma]], [[Ryuuga (cookie)|]], and [[Yuusaku (inmu)|]]. Her unrecognizableness became her biggest joke, with others just refering to her as \"Who?\" (taken from Akanuma) or \"That mysterious elf\". Frequent jokes about her being homeless because of how unpopular she is began to spread too. A video of Joker dancing was leaked in 2017, but unlike other doxxings this ended with the doxxer being harassed for having crossed a line. During Nabe☆ she adds a [[daikon]] into the nabe, so [[Reu Daikon]] began appearing alongside her, or her in a daikon costume herself. For some reason also has been paired with [[Suzu (cookie)|]], to the point where it SZJO is now both of their main ships.\r\n\r\nh4.

Detailed and specialized tagging is what made Danbooru become an anime-art [i]database[/i], instead of just a huge collection only good enough for casual browsing.\r\n\r\nUsers at \"Member\":[/wiki_pages/43574] level can be invited to become \"Builder\":[/wiki_pages/43574] when their prominent tagging efforts are noticed. \r\n([tn]See \"Help:Users#Getting_Promoted\":[/wiki_pages/43574] for more information.[/tn])\r\n\r\nIf you have any trouble or issue with tagging, please create a thread in the \"Forum\":/forum_topics to ask, or consider using an already existing tag help thread.\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Existing tag help threads:[/b]\r\n\r\n* [b]How do I tag this?[/b] (topic #12251) is for help on tagging things specifically.\r\n* [b]Wiki Requests[/b] (topic #12858) is for questions on the definition of a tag. \r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4#rule_of_thumb. Rule of Thumb\r\n\r\n[b]Tag what you see, not what you know[/b]. In other words, only tag [b]the visual and factual elements in the image[/b]. For example, images where the full moon is prominently depicted will have a [[full_moon]] tag. Ideally you should use an existing tag on Danbooru.\r\nThis means you should not tag what you know about a character. For example [[Remilia Scarlet]] is supposed to be a vampire, but don't tag every picture depicting her with the [[vampire]] tag. Only use the vampire tag if the characteristics are clearly visible. \r\n\r\n[b]Do not[/b] use [[tag_group:subjective|subjective tags]] (such as sexy, cute, hot, etc.). These tags are problematic because they are based on personal opinion, and different opinions can conflict.

Using the Related Tags Features\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Note:[/b] This part of the guide only applies to the built-in tag editor on the Post Full View. If you are using DanbooruUp or any third party tools, please also consult the tools' own documentation for help.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nDanbooru's Related Tags features are a great help at finding suitable candidates among the tens of thousands of tags already in use on Danbooru. If, for example, you are having some difficulty coming up with a new tag for the likes of that seemingly exotic accessory that character is wearing on her forearm, Related Tags may help you find the tag you have been looking for.\r\n\r\nWhen you call on one of the Related Tags features, you will get a list of commonly accompanying tags for the tag that the cursor is currently on. It will also list the tags that are linked from its wiki page.\r\n\r\nAdd related tags by clicking on a tag from the lists that appear. Tags that have been added will be highlighted in blue. Clicking on a highlighted tag removes the tag from the image.\r\n\r\nh6#related_tags. Related Tags\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get a list of tags which commonly accompany it.\r\n\r\nConsider the tag [[witch]]. Calling on Related Tags will reveal that images with [[witch]] also tend to contain [[broom]], [[ribbon]], [[witch_hat]], and [[dress]]. Owing to the fact that the black witch [[Kirisame_Marisa]], a character from [[Touhou]] is very heavily featured on Danbooru's collection, both tags will also appear on the list.\r\n\r\nh6#related_characters. Related Characters\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get only [[character:]] tags which commonly accompany it. This is intended to be used with [[copyright:]] tags. Consider the tag [[K-On!]] (full: [[copyright:K-On!]]). The list for [[K-On!]] will mostly feature names of characters from [[K-On!]].\r\n\r\nBeware that characters from other copyrights may creep up into this list. This happens because there is a considerable number of [[crossover]] [[K-On!]] art. Verify this with this search {{K-On! crossover}}. \r\n\r\nh6#related_copyrights. Related Copyrights\r\n\r\nFor the tag that your cursor is currently on, you will get only [[copyright:]] tags that commonly accompany it. This is intended to be used with [[character:]] tags. Consider the infamous miko with detached sleeves, [[Hakurei_Reimu]]. Calling on related copyrights will list [[Touhou]] related copyrights, and crossovers featuring [[Touhou]] characters.\r\n\r\nh6#favorite_tags. Favorite Tags\r\n\r\nThis is a list of tags which have been entered into your [b]Uploaded Tags[/b] list in you Settings screen under your [b]My Account[/b] control panel.\r\n\r\nh6#limitations. Beware of Limitations\r\n\r\nThe Related Tags lists are arranged alphabetically, instead of by relevance, or by number of posts. This may cause complete confusion to taggers who are completely new to the copyright or characters featured on the image they have just uploaded.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is always advisable to research copyrights and the associated characters before tagging.\r\n\r\nh4#tag-consistency. Tag Consistency and Integrity\r\n\r\nPlease double-check your tags on the left side of the screen after applying them. If you have any tags with a total count of 1, a new tag has been created. Often, tag creation on Danbooru is not necessary. If this happens, please check that your tags have been correctly spelled.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that your tags are correctly spelled, it is best to pick your tags from the Related Tags lists, as doing this automatically enters the tags for you.\r\n\r\nh6#use_existing_tags. Use Danbooru's Existing Tags\r\n\r\nPlease use Danbooru's existing tags whenever possible, but do create a new tag if you are sure that it is not covered by existing tags or pools. If you aren't sure about which tag to use, don't be afraid to ask on the forums. Danbooru most often uses the original language's title when naming copyrights and characters, so always double check. See [[howto:copyright]] and [[howto:romanize]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4#tag_creation. Creating a New Tag\r\n\r\nOnly ASCII characters are permitted in tag names. Tags must be romanized if they're coming from Japanese or another language that uses non-ASCII characters. See [[howto:romanize]] for details.\r\n\r\nh6. Name restrictions\r\n\r\nTag names carry several restrictions, either for technical reasons or simplicity:\r\n* Tags cannot contain non-ASCII characters. This includes Japanese letters. Replace them with their appropriate [[howto:romanize|romanization]] if necessary.\r\n* Tags cannot contain asterisks. They are used as a wildcard in searches.\r\n* Tags cannot contain spaces. Replace them with underscores instead, as spaces are used to delimit tags.\r\n* Tags cannot contain commas.\r\n* Tags cannot end with an underscore.\r\n* Tags cannot contain consecutive underscores.\r\n* Tags cannot contain unprintable characters.\r\n* Tags cannot exceed 170 characters in length.\r\n\r\nh6. Tag types\r\n\r\n* [b]Artist[/b] names carry the prefix ''artist:'' or ''art:''\r\n* [b]Character[/b] names carry the prefix ''character:'' or ''char:''\r\n* [b]Copyright[/b] titles carry the prefix ''copyright:'' or ''copy:''\r\n* [b]Meta[/b] tags carry the prefix ''meta:''\r\n* [b]General[/b] tags are normally not prefixed at all, because all tags without a prefix are by default automatically assumed to be ''general:'' or ''gen:''\r\n\r\nIf you create a tag with the wrong type, or notice a tag with an incorrect type, you can edit the post and add the correct prefix to the tag in order to change its type. This can only be done for existing tags if their post count is lower than a certain amount depending on user level, the specific thresholds are documented in [[help:users]].\r\n\r\nh6. Naming a tag\r\n[b]Use singular nouns.[/b] This especially concerns tags about objects which appear multiple times in an image. Under all circumstances, use the [b]singular[/b] for the object. If an image contains a bin full of [[wispberries]], tag it [[wispberry]]. This greatly simplifies searching and tagging.\r\n\r\n[b]Resolving Ambiguities with Qualifiers.[/b] If the tag you are going to use had already been taken up for another purpose (other character with the same name, character with the same name as an object, character and series have the same name, etc.), add a qualifier between () to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nFor example Black Rock Shooter is both the OVA name and the female protagonist's name.\r\n\r\n* [[Black_Rock_Shooter]] is used for the copyright.\r\n* [[Black_Rock_Shooter_(character)]] is used to indicate the female protagonist.\r\n\r\nSee [[help:qualifiers]] for further reading.\r\n\r\n[b]New Character Tags.[/b] Always use the character's full name in your tags. Name order should appear the same as in the original materials. Commonly:\r\n* SurName_FirstName for Asians. Example: [[Shameimaru_Aya]], where Shameimaru is her surname.\r\n* FirstName_SurName for Westerners, and most other ethnicities. Example: [[Ken_Masters]].\r\n\r\nh4#see_also.

Danbooru Upload Guidelines\r\n\r\nThank you for donating your spare time to help the Danbooru collection grow. While we need a constant supply of new images to keep our collection fresh and up to date, we must make it clear that Danbooru has stricter quality standards compared to most galleries of its kind.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of things to know before you begin:\r\n\r\nh5. Read the [[help:upload rules|Upload Rules]] before proceeding\r\n\r\nThe upload rules describe what is and isn't allowed. In particular:\r\n\r\n* Fully [[ai-generated]] works and [[paid reward]]s are forbidden.\r\n* Some types of posts, like [[cosplay photo]]s, [[furry]] artwork, and extreme fetish content are considered borderline and should be uploaded sparingly.\r\n\r\nPlease read the upload rules in full before proceeding.\r\n\r\nh5#subjective. Danbooru is Subjective\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that not everything you upload may be approved. Danbooru judges posts based on quality, which is a highly subjective measure. While there's no way to know for sure whether a post will be approved, uploaders can gauge a rough idea of what the standards are by looking at preexisting approved posts. Search {{status:active approver:any}} to find posts that have gone through and passed approval.\r\n\r\nGenerally, posts with [[bad anatomy]] or a lot of [[JPEG artifacts]], or very [[lowres|low resolution]] will have a hard time getting approved, while competently drawn images will be approved fairly quickly. If you're not sure whether an image meets our standards, you can try asking in the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/danbooru).\r\n\r\nDon't take it personally if a few of your uploads are deleted - we've all been there at some point. If you think your posts deserve a second look, you can appeal them. See the [[howto:appeal]] page for more information.\r\n\r\nh4#uploading. Uploading\r\n\r\nTo upload a post, simply either paste the link into the \"upload page\":[/uploads/new], use the \"bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], or the \"web extension\":[https://github.com/danbooru/upload-to-danbooru]. Many of the most popular art sites are supported natively by Danbooru, so all it takes is pasting a link into the upload page. \"See here\":/static/bookmarklet for a list of supported sites.\r\n\r\nTry not to upload images from sources that aren't from the original artist or a [[second-party source]] (official accounts for a game or anime in case of [[official art]], or a commissioner, etc), and always look for an [[help:image source|original source]] whenever possible. Sites such as 4chan, Reddit, or Facebook are not ideal places to source your image, unless the artist posted their art there or has long deleted their original post.\r\n\r\nTry to avoid picking files directly from your device, as doing this means you won't benefit from the source and artist tag autofilling that Danbooru performs. Exceptions to this are if the original post by the artist is no longer available (in which case, remember to tag [[bad id]]) or if you're uploading your own artwork (please specify so by tagging [[self-upload]]).\r\n\r\nh5#minimal_tagging_criteria. Minimal Tagging Criteria\r\n\r\nComprehensive tagging is the essence of Danbooru, [[unlimited blade works (reality marble)|its body and its blood]]. The basic expectations for tagging are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Artists must be credited.\r\n** If you uploaded by pasting a link, Danbooru should autofill this data for you, assuming the artist is in our database.\r\n** If not, read [[help:artists]] for information on creating an entry.\r\n** If all else fails, or the artist is unidentifiable by any conventional means (common with [[official art]]), tag [[artist request]].\r\n* Copyrights which a character is from must be identified.\r\n** Place a [[copyright request]] if you cannot surely identify it.\r\n* Characters must be identified.\r\n** Use the [[original]] tag if it's an original character.\r\n*** Some recurring [[original]] characters may have character tags of their own. They may be listed on the artist's wiki page, which you can access through the question mark symbol next to the artist's tag.\r\n** Place a [[character request]] if you aren't sure where a character comes from.\r\n* All posts should be tagged to at least Level 1 per the [[howto:tag checklist]].\r\n** If you are not sure if an image is tagged completely enough, always place a [[tagme]] tag, and another contributor will review your tags, adding and making corrections as necessary. \r\n** Do not frequently use [[tagme]] as an excuse for being too lazy to tag own uploads. Neglecting tagging is considered a violation of the rules and may lead to action being taken against your account if done repeatedly.\r\n\r\nFor Tagging Guidelines in greater detail, please see [[howto:tag]] and [[howto:tag_checklist]].\r\n\r\nh5#make_use_of_comments_and_the_forum. Make Use of Comments, Discord and the Forum\r\n\r\nMost of the time, a cursory trip to Google will help you accomplish most things such as finding out which copyright a character comes from. If you have an issue that where Google research just wouldn't do, please [[help:comments|leave a comment]] on the image about the issue you want to clarify, or ask in the \"Official Discord\":https://discord.gg/danbooru or in the forums.\r\n\r\nh5#check_for_duplicates. Check for Duplicates\r\n\r\nBe sure that your post has not been uploaded by someone else. When uploading an image that the system has deemed to be a likely duplicate, a [b]Duplicate[/b] badge will appear below the image.\r\n\r\nIf your image has already been uploaded, only upload if you have a higher quality copy. Once you have uploaded your higher quality copy, set all existing copies of the image as child posts of your copy.\r\nBigger size doesn't necessarily mean better quality, unless the filesizes vastly differ. For example, if one image is 800 kb and another is 840 kb, it's very likely they'll be [[duplicate]]s. Always check the images closely before uploading if you're unsure.\r\n\r\nFor more information on setting Parent and Child Posts, refer to the chapter on [[help:post_relationships|Managing Parent and Child Posts]] in the Contributor's Guide.\r\n\r\nh4#see_also.

Also known as the \"God of Storms\" or \"Lord of the Tower\", he was a god from around 2600 years before the events of the game who founded and ruled Old Mondstadt.\r\n\r\nAt an unknown point in time, Decarabian founded Old Mondstadt, which at it's peak, spread through Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland with the capital city in the area now known as Stormterror's Lair. During the Archon War, conflict grew between him and [[Andrius (genshin impact)|Boreas]], starting the era known as the \"Age of Kings\". Using his power, Boreas transformed the land around Mondstadt into a frozen wasteland, leading to Decarabian surrounding the capital city with a wind barrier, barring both exit and entry.\r\n\r\nIn his eyes, he gave his people shelter from the bitter cold and believed they loved him as he did them. However, to his people, he was a cruel and selfish ruler who locked them in. As frustration over Decarabian's rule grew, it would lead to a rebellion which was led by the [[Nameless Bard (genshin impact)|]], a [[Barbatos (genshin impact)|wind spirit]], Decarabian's former lover [[Amos (genshin impact)|]], a knight (possibly [[Gunnhildr (genshin impact)|]]) and a [[red-haired warrior (genshin impact)|]] (possibly an ancestor to [[Diluc (genshin impact)|]]). They would eventually emerge victorious as Decarabian was finally slain. Decarabian's death, along with Boreas choosing to pass on, allowed Barbatos to ascend to godhood and become the Anemo Archon.\r\n\r\nHe is named after Decarabia, the 69th demon from the [[Ars Goetia]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Also known as \"Boreas\", he was a god in Mondstadt and is currently the Wolf of the North of Mondstadt's Four Winds.\r\n\r\nAt an unknown point in time, an unknown ancient god gave Boread his powers, putting him on the level of a god. During the Archon War, conflict grew between him and [[Decarabian (genshin impact)|]], with Boreas transforming the land around Mondstadt into a frozen wasteland, leading to Decarabian surrounding his capital city with a wind barrier, barring both exit and entry. This started the era known as the \"Age of Kings\" and Mondstadt was consumed by ice and snow.\r\n\r\nSometime later during the Archon War, Boreas decided he was unworthy of becoming the Archon and chose to pass on. Boreas' passing, along with Decarabian's death, allowed [[Barbatos (genshin impact)|]] to ascend to godhood and become the Anemo Archon. After his death, part of his spirit took on his current form and sometime after [[Vennessa (genshin impact)|]]'s rebellion roughly 1000 years ago, Boreas became one of the Four Winds. Eventually, he settled in Wolvendom and became the leader of a wolf pack, taking in [[Razor (genshin impact)|]] shortly before the events of the game.\r\n\r\nHe is depicted as a large, blue and white [[wolf]] with [[glowing eyes|glowing]] [[blue eyes]].\r\n\r\nVoiced by Jacob Craner in English and Kusunoki Taiten in Japanese.\r\n\r\nHe is named after Boreas, the God of the North Wind and Storms in [[Greek Mythology]] and his name Andrius is likely named after Andrealphus, the 65th demon from the [[Ars Goetia]].\r\n\r\nh4.
