Frequently portrayed in fan works as the [[sadism|Ultimate Sadistic Creature]] (USC), as a bloodthirsty psychopath, or as tsundere.  Usually some combination of the first two (or of all three).

A being with no sex depicted as any of these may technically count.\r\n\r\nThis tag can also be applied to an [[otoko no ko]] if the character is given female traits such as the presence of actual [[cleavage]] or the obvious absence of a [[bulge]] at the crotch. For [[reverse trap]]s, the absence of cleavage or presence of a bulge applies.\r\n\r\nIf a character is genderswapped often enough, the genderswapped version may be given its own name. For male-to-female genderswaps, this is often the normal character's name with \"ko\" appended to it. (子 \"Ko\" meaning \"child\" is a common ending for Japanese girls' names.) For female-to-male genderswaps, \"o\" is sometimes added. \r\n\r\nKnown in Internet circles as Rule 63, wherein there is a female or male version of any given male or female character, respectively.\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b] \r\n* If the person has only swapped bodies with another from the opposite sex, but the body itself has not changed, then use [[personality switch]] instead.\r\n* The \"女体化\" tag may also on occasion be used to describe female [[personification]], rather than a genderswap.\r\n* If a character in canon is genderswapped but rarely shown in their original form (such as [[Mai Natsume]] or [[Tanya Degurechaff]]), the tag only applies if said original form is included or somehow alluded to.\r\n* For posts depicting a character undergoing the process of gender transition, use the tag [[gender transitioning]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The series is well known for its \"Arino's Challenge\" (有野の挑戦状, [i]Arino no Chousenjou[/i]) segments, where Arino plays through and attempts to complete retro games with the help of his Assistant Directors and various other staff members. It was briefly brought over to the West in the late 2000's as [i]Retro Game Master[/i]. [[Nintendo]] eventually released a parody of the series in 2015 on its Youtube page titled [i]Gamecenter DX[/i], which has Arino's co-star Hamaguchi Masaru as a manager playing games that haven't been released.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the series had a [[Nintendo DS]] game modeled after it: [i][[Gamecenter CX: Arino's Challenge]][/i], with a lot of the game's input coming directly from the show's staff. The game then got a sequel in 2009 and a [[Nintendo 3DS]] sequel in 2014.\r\n\r\nh4.
