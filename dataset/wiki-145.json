Lives in a camper [[van]], and has questionable hygienic practices. Although he cares for his adoptive parents, they are shown to disagree with his line of work.

As a child, he lost his eye to an incident involving a wizard and a sentient grimoire of explosives, and in the game's current year he lives with, and dotes on, his blind, job-obsessed mother, where he's shown to be much more personable and friendly while off the clock.

The vans got their nickname due to their outer resemblance to a [[loaf of bread]] – except the [[ambulance]] version, which gets called a \"Tabletka\" ('Таблетка'), or '[[pill]]' in [[russian text|Russian]].\r\n\r\nSince 1985, the vans received updates: more modern engines and internationally compliant lighting, as well as new model numbers, 3741 for the standard van, while (crew-cab) trucks mostly starting with 3303, often with one or two extra digits specifying the version. From 1997, bigger 33036 truck variants with a 25 cm longer wheelbase, and taller soft-top roof bows and drop-sides were added.\r\n\r\nh1.

Not \"ports\", just port. It only has one. Shells are loaded and ejected from the bottom of the receiver during a normal pump stroke.

It is simple to mount a scope on; dirt and other potential hazards only have one possible point of entry.
