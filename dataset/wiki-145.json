He is believed to have come from the isolated star of Fomalhaut to this planet. The specs of the body he was born with are unusually high. However, he is extremely weak on the mental front to the point that it can eclipse his physical strong points. He can't handle complex thinking and is especially bad at numbers. Despite normally speaking with confidence, Cthugha has a surprisingly low self-esteem. It depresses him when his words come back to haunt him and cause him to physically blow up and damage his surroundings. Those who know this about him see him as someone who's dangerous when summoned, so that's why he's alone. His summoning this time has him misunderstanding and becoming an overpowered reincarnated hero from some story somewhere, and now it looks like he's attempting to turn things around in one big home run. Since he doesn't understand bantering and has burned countless followers, it appears the ex-ruler and winner at life in Aoyama is avoiding him. This relationship has not changed since their time at Old Ones, and there is no sign of making a new connection here. Cthugha has one-sided feelings of sympathy for people who appear to talk in circles but not get anywhere.\r\n\r\nh4.

He acts like a delinquent, but at his core, he is serious and responsible.

He attends Akihabara Academy where many creative types go to school, where he takes traditional craft courses in things like swordsmithing and clothes making. There are many other students who attend this school that love the other courses like manga, anime, game distribution, and illustration. He may not understand it much, but Akiha thinks highly of his friends who are so passionate about their favorite things. He is very assertive in trying out somewhat risque cosplay, and his nearby friends often get involved with it. Some of those around him call him the \"black crow who's nice to otaku,\" but of course he doesn't get this. Outside of school, he works hard every morning in training drills as part of his local youth firefighter team and super buff clique. Akiha is enthusiastic about protecting the city of Tokyo with his own hands from the disasters arising from increasing social anxiety nowadays. Should someone close to him ask him for help, Akiha would use his power and jump into the sea of flames to do so. But it's also because of this power that some of the passionate creators around him fear him and distance themselves from him.\r\n\r\nh4.

teacher from the world of Wa no Kuni. He is a master of the Iga ninja corps and has come to pass on that wisdom and experience to the next generation. He specializes in body double arts above all others. His body double does not refer to moving so fast it looks to people as if there are several people present, but a secret technique where he is literally splitting himself apart and have his living body parts move in tandem. As a result of this, binding techniques and cutting attacks are mostly useless against him. Sandayu isn't actually human, but a rokurokubi or a type of ghost from another land known as a hitouban. He's the type of teacher who gladly teaches his techniques and knowledge to others. He often wanders from school to school wherever many problems arise and vacancies crop up. He likes students with strong competitive spirits that try to surpass their masters.
