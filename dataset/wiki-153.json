The Hammond B3 is arguably the most famous of this type, widely used in jazz, blues and rock music.\r\n\r\nA prominent feature of most types of organs is the existence of at least two manuals (keyboard sets; with a light, spring-weighted action unlike that of a piano), a pedalboard, and a number of \"stops\" or switches which activate different sets of pipes for varied color.\r\n\r\n*Not to be confused with biological [[organs]].*\r\n\r\nh4.

Images are made up of two color layers, superimposed, but offset with respect to each other to produce a depth effect. Usually the main subject is in the center, while the foreground and background are shifted laterally in opposite directions. The picture contains two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the \"color coded\" \"3D glasses\", they reveal an integrated stereoscopic image. The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into perception of a three dimensional scene or composition.\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with the much more common [[chromatic aberration]], which is visually similar to [[anaglyph]], but is not intended to create a stereoscopic image.  [[Chromatic aberration]] typically offsets color layers of the entire image uniformly, whereas true [[anaglyph]] offsets foreground and background differently to create the 3D effect.

Variants as to how that happened include getting tied to the tracks by school bullies, or being pushed, or just a simple accidental fall. \r\n\r\nWithout her legs, the Teke-Teke can 'only' move by dragging herself along with her upper arms, causing a distinctive \"teke-teke\" scratching noise from which she gets her name. Some variants have her 'walk' by using her arms as legs, but she usually still makes that scratching noise.\r\n\r\nThe Teke-Teke's modus operandi is to ambush isolated victims at night to slice them in half across the torso (emulating her death). This is often done with a Grim Reaper-style scythe. \r\n\r\nThe Teke-Teke is usually depicted as a girl in a Japanese [[school uniform|schoolgirl uniform]] (often bloodied) with her lower half missing. Some depictions will also have an exposed lower spine jutting out at where her torso was cut in half. The Teke-Teke is usually armed with a [[scythe]], or less commonly, a long [[knife]] or some other bladed weapon.\r\n\r\nWhen written in Japanese, the Teke-Teke creepypasta/character is almost always written in katakana, as テケテケ.\r\n\r\nh4.

This pattern is sometimes found on clothing and tattoos worn by characters associated with the Theocracy of Plegia in [[Fire Emblem Awakening]].\r\n\r\nAs the 'eyes' are often split into two groups of three on either sides of a character's clothing (with only one side being visible), the presence of two to three such eyes should generally suffice to tag eyes_of_grima.\r\n\r\nAvoid tagging this if the eyes are barely visible (i.e. not enough to visually discern a pattern), even if the character is implied to be wearing them. Also avoid tagging this for [[Grima_(Fire Emblem)|]]'s actual eyes while in dragon (or some fan-depicted humanoid) form.\r\n\r\nh4.

Based on recovered [[M1A4 Juggernaut]]s, the Reginlef is designed for speed and mobility at the expense of armor and firepower compared to the Federal Republic's other Feldreßs.

In series it is described as looking like a prowling spider.\r\n\r\nThe M1A4 Juggernaut is labelled as a military \"drone\" by the Republic of San Magnolia, though it is actually a piloted Feldreß (multi-legged armored-weapon system).  Given the official labelling as a drone, the armor and life-preserving equipment were either minimal or not present in the design.  The cockpit was enclosed by a clam-shell armored canopy, but as this prevented the pilot from seeing out they would have to depend on viewscreens for sight.  These viewscreens were of low resolution though, and so resulted in poor visibility for pilots.  The joint connecting the armored canopy was also not particularly durable, so a strong impact could dislodge the canopy from the Juggernaut.  Given the design of the cockpit this would also result in the canopy decapitating the pilot, and as such the canopy was also referred to as \"the guillotine.\"  Due to poor quality control in their manufacturing the canopy would not form a complete seal over the cockpit, thus leaving the pilot exposed to the environment outside. \r\n\r\nh6.
