It follows two girls - one who's a black-haired [[oni_(hentatsu)|oni]] (voiced by Takasugi Kaoru) and another who's pink-haired, wears glasses and has [[neko_(hentatsu)|cat ears]] (voiced by [[Kadowaki Mai]]) - as they discuss a variety of things.\r\n\r\nFollowing a teaser on the 28th of December (announcing that something was to be aired on four different channels on the 4th of January, 2020 at 23:57), it was revealed on the 4th that Hentatsu would be airing a new set of shorts on TV, the shorts being shortly after being uploaded to Twitter and YouTube. \r\n\r\nDuring the original web shorts, the two girls remained unnamed, though Kadowaki referred to her character as 猫さん (neko-san/cat). With the TV shorts, the official website made for them merely refers to them as \"Oni\" and \"Neko\" respectively.\r\n\r\nFans theorize that the oni girl represents [[tatsuki_(irodori)|irodori]]'s [[tatsuki_(person)|Tatsuki]], while the cat-eared girl represents [[Isa Yoshihisa]], another member of irodori. Isa is credited in irodori's works as 平安, which is usually pronounced Heian, but is pronounced Hen in Okinawa; Isa being an Okinawan family name. This would make the title of the series a combination of Hen and Tatsuki's names.\r\n\r\nh4.
