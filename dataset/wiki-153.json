The high-quality private education from her family, along with her natural strength and intelligence, made her an outstanding elite with both the brains and battle skills. She is extremely beautiful. She always wears tailored clothes, showing off the look of a perfect gentleman and a lady. She has extravagant taste and has a knack in \"aesthetics.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike normal succubi that seduce humans and absorb their energy, she summons and throws ice, pushing the enemy to move away from her. Due to this, although she aced her school subjects, her grades for the \"Seduction\" class were close to failure. It's very fortunate of her to have been born into a rich family, where she still can live without gaining human energy by herself.\r\n\r\nShe's from the same class as Yuze. She graduated second place after Yuze, who aced the mandatory Seduction class essential to the succubi. After having a tough time accepting her defeat, she thinks of Yuze as her rival - so much so that she changed her future career job from \"an orchestra maestro\" to \"an adventurer\" after seeing Yuze exclaim her dream to become one with such enthusiasm. In contrast to all this, Yuze considers Bianca as a smart and pretty friend. Bianca can't help herself sulking and pouting at Yuze, who is so undesigningly kind to her.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ビアンカ(ガーディアンテイルズ)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147813,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:29:17.959-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:29:17.959-04:00","title":"nyuunai-suzume","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["入内雀"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147812,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:23:07.041-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:23:07.041-04:00","title":"kani_hime_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["蟹姬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147811,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:18:52.040-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:18:52.040-04:00","title":"nekomata_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["猫掌柜","猫又"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147810,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:59.617-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:59.617-04:00","title":"nurikabe_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["涂壁","ぬりかべ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147809,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:46.186-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:46.186-04:00","title":"kinnara_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["紧那罗","緊那羅"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147808,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:36.256-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:36.256-04:00","title":"kidoumaru_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["鬼童丸"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147807,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:27.385-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:10:27.385-04:00","title":"ungaikyou_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["云外镜","雲外鏡"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147806,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:55.476-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:55.476-04:00","title":"tenken_jinshin_onikiri_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["天剑韧心鬼切","天剣刃心鬼切"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147805,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:38.740-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:38.740-04:00","title":"mushishi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["虫师","蟲師"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147804,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:27.256-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:27.256-04:00","title":"kisei_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["弈","棋聖"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147803,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:07.131-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:09:07.131-04:00","title":"kosode_no_te_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小袖之手","小袖の手"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147801,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:19.760-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:19.760-04:00","title":"komatsumaru_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小松丸"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147800,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:12.719-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:12.719-04:00","title":"usagimaru_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["兔丸"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147799,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:58.900-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:58.900-04:00","title":"kingyo_hime_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["金鱼姬","金魚姫"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147798,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:42.854-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:42.854-04:00","title":"korouka_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["古笼火","古籠火"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147797,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:19.018-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:19.018-04:00","title":"jorougumo_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["络新妇","絡新婦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147796,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:04.403-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:07:04.403-04:00","title":"futakuchi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["二口女"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147795,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:56.210-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:56.210-04:00","title":"kamaitachi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["镰鼬","鎌鼬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147794,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:37.367-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:37.367-04:00","title":"ryoumenbotoke_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["两面佛","両面仏"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147793,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:17.750-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:17.750-04:00","title":"umibouzu_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["海坊主"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147792,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:07.186-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:07.186-04:00","title":"yamawaro_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["山童"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147791,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:01.321-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:06:01.321-04:00","title":"kairaishi_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["傀儡师"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147790,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:44.610-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:44.610-04:00","title":"kudagitsune_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["管狐"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147789,"created_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:07.103-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-01T11:05:07.103-04:00","title":"ame_onna_(onmyoji)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_na
