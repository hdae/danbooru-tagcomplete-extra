Metatags where basic syntax cannot be used\r\n\r\n* [code]limit[/code]\r\n* [code]parent[/code]\r\n* [code]child[/code]\r\n* [code]pool[/code]\r\n\r\nh5. Units\r\n\r\nWith certain metatags, units are used. The basic syntax works the same with units.\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n[code][metatag]:[number][unit][/code]\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{age:..10weeks}}\r\n\r\nh6. Age units\r\n\r\nThese units are used together with the [i]age[/i] metatag.\r\n\r\n* seconds (s)\r\n* minutes (mi)\r\n* hours (h)\r\n* days (d)\r\n* weeks (w)\r\n* months (mo)\r\n* years (y)\r\n\r\nThe shorthand version is in parenthesis. You can use any number of characters between the shorthand version and full version. For example, \"se\" or \"sec\" work in place of s or seconds. \r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{age:2weeks..1mo}}\r\n\r\n[i]Note: not specifying the time unit is no longer supported and will return no results. \"m\" will also return no results as it is ambiguous between minutes and months.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: singular and plural forms of units can be used interchangeably.[/i]\r\n\r\nh6. Filesize units\r\n\r\nThese units are used together with the [i]filesize[/i] metatag.\r\n\r\n* b (bytes)\r\n* kb (kilobytes)\r\n* m (megabytes)\r\n\r\nOnly the shorthand versions will work, i.e. bytes, kilobytes and megabytes are not part of the syntax.\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{filesize:<=10kb}}\r\n\r\n[i]Note: if no unit is specified it defaults to bytes.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: for anyone curious, 1m = 1024kb and 1kb = 1024b.[/i]\r\n\r\nh6. Ratios\r\n\r\nFor the metatag [i]ratio[/i], fractions are commonly used but you may use decimal notation also.\r\n\r\nThe aspect ratio denotes the relationship between the width and height of an image. For example, a 1:1 ratio means the width and height are equal whereas a 4:3 ratio means the width is one third longer (4/3) than the height. Useful aspect ratio tool: http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n[code]ratio:[width]/[height]\r\nratio:[number][/code]\r\n\r\n[i]Examples:[/i]\r\n* {{ratio:16/9}}\r\n* {{ratio:1.78}}\r\n\r\n[i]Note: colons are supported in place of slashes; e.g., {{ratio:16:9}}.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: using ratios won't always result in pixel perfect results as the ratios are rounded to two decimal points, i.e. a search for {{ratio:16/9}} may result in a picture with the dimensions 1920x1078 instead of 1920x1080.[/i]\r\n\r\nh6. Why should you use ratios?\r\n\r\nRatios can be used to assist in finding wallpapers. For example, if you have a 1920x1080 monitor, you can use {{ratio:16/9 width:>=1920}} to find wallpapers for it.\r\n\r\nh6. Tip\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid calculating ratios altogether, then you can use dimensions directly.\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{ratio:1920/1200}} is equivalent to {{ratio:8/5}}\r\n\r\nh6. \"Basic syntax\":[#dtext-basic]\r\n\r\nYou can use basic syntax with ratios; though, take note if you use fractions.\r\n\r\nFirst, the site will calculate all fractions into a decimal notation and round it off to two decimals, e.g. {{ratio:16:9}} becomes {{ratio:1.78}}.\r\n\r\nAt this point it's regular numbers and normal basic syntax will work as expected.\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{ratio:16/10..16/9}} becomes {{ratio:1.6..1.78}} (Note: 16/9..16/10 won't work. See under Intervals on this page)\r\n{{ratio:..16/9}} becomes {{ratio:..1.78}}\r\n\r\nh4.

The company was headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo, before moving to Mitaka, Tokyo.\r\n\r\nThe studio was formed in the early 1980s as [[Daicon]] Film by university students [[Anno Hideaki]], [[Sadamoto Yoshiyuki]], Yamaga Hiroyuki, [[Akai Takami]], Okada Toshio, Takeda Yasuhiro, and [[Higuchi Shinji]]. Their first project was to make an animated short for the 20th Annual Japan National SF Convention, also known as [[Daicon III]], held in 1981 in Osaka, Japan. The group made a much bigger splash at the 22nd Annual Japan National SF Convention, [[Daicon IV]], in 1983.\r\n\r\nThe Daicon IV short firmly established Daicon Film as a talented new anime studio. The studio changed its name to Gainax in 1985, basing the term 'Gainax' on an obscure Tottori Prefecture term for 'giant' and the English suffix 'x'.\r\n\r\nSince Gainax originated as a group of fans, it was known for maintaining ties to the general [[otaku]] community, allowing doujinshi of its work, fan-made action figures, and promoting series like Evangelion at private festivals and so on.\r\n\r\nUntil Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gainax typically worked on stories created in-house, but the studio increasingly developed anime adaptations of existing manga like [[Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou]] and [[Mahoromatic]].\r\n\r\nThe Animage Anime Grand Prix has been awarded to Gainax for Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water in 1991, Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995 and 1996, and [[The End of Evangelion]] in 1997.\r\n\r\nMuch of Gainax's former staff and series left Gainax starting in the late 2000s; notably Anno Hideaki formed [[Studio Khara]] and obtained the rights to Evangelion, several staff members (including those involved in [[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]) left to make [[Trigger (company)|Studio Trigger]], and Gainax sold their rights to FLCL to I.G. Production. [[gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]] is also made of former Gainax staff, having left in the early 90s.\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 2024, Gainax filed for bankruptcy with the Tokyo District Court, which was publicly announced over one week later on June 7. The remainder of its properties were split between the various Gainax splinter companies and former staff previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* pool #20604\r\n\r\nh4.
