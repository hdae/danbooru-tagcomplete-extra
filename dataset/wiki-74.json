Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres that range from Electronic music, Industrial Rock, Industrial Metal, Alternative Rock and Dark Ambient.\r\n\r\nAfter recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. \r\n\r\nReznor produced several highly influential records in the 90s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits. Two Nine Inch Nails recordings have won Grammy Awards and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 30 million albums worldwide, with 11 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\r\n\r\nTrent Reznor has also created musical scores for several [[video game]]s and movies. [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] (2011) film musical score by Reznor won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. \r\n\r\nSince 1989, Nine Inch Nails has made nine major studio releases, which are called \"Halos\".\r\n\r\nh4.NIN Discography\r\n\r\n* Pretty Hate Machine (1989)\r\n* Broken (EP) (1992) - 2 Grammy awards for \"Wish\" and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\", Best Metal Performance, 1992 and 1995 (Woodstock '94 compilation)\r\n* [[The Downward Spiral]] (1994)\r\n* [[The Fragile]] (1999)\r\n* With Teeth (2005)\r\n* Year Zero (2007)\r\n* Ghosts I–IV (2008)\r\n* The Slip (2008)\r\n* Hesitation Marks (2013)\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Quake 1]]\r\n* [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["NIN","NIИ","ナイン・インチ・ネイルズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":219023,"created_at":"2024-12-16T12:40:52.745-05:00","updated_at":"2024-12-16T12:40:52.745-05:00","title":"pump_(font)","body":"A sans-serif font created in 1970 by Bob Newman.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":219022,"created_at":"2024-12-16T12:33:57.474-05:00","updated_at":"2024-12-16T12:33:57.474-05:00","title":"balloon_(font)","body":"A font created in 1939 by Max R.

It typically consists of a [[kimono]] (often with simple decorative patterns), a [[hakama skirt]] worn over it at the waist, and high [[lace-up_boots|laced boots]], sometimes with a [[hair bow]].\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the [[Meiji]] Era, the Japanese government began to encourage the establishment of women's junior high schools. Typical Japanese women's clothing at the time, however, was more showy and elaborate than modest or functional. As a result, this style quickly rose in popularity as a more practical alternative for women attending school. Even in the present day, it is traditional attire for women at some college graduation ceremonies, \"as seen here\":[https://ganbaregenki.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/hakama2.jpg?w=640].\r\n\r\nDespite the name of the tag, this is [i]not[/i] explicitly worn by schoolgirls, and it is [i]not[/i] restricted to depictions of the Meiji era (especially since the style remained popular into the Taisho era).\r\n\r\nAlthough this outfit looks quite similar to some types of traditional Japanese [[waitress]] attire, the two should not be confused with one another (Although [[Bashamichi|in some cases]], it may be difficult). As a rule of thumb, if the girl in question is wearing [[tasuki]] or has rolled-up/pushed-up sleeves, then these may be indicators of a waitress uniform (as well as less-subtle signs such as [[name tag]]s, [[menu]]s, serving trays, etc.)\r\n\r\nh4.

Most famous for actions in [[World War II]], especially the 6 June 1944 [[invasion_of_normandy|Normandy invasion]] ([[D-Day]]) and the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. They were nicknamed the \"Screaming Eagles\" due to their unit insignia showing an eagle's head with open beak.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the D-Day landings, the 101st painted playing card symbols on the sides of their helmets to assist with unit identification. (As the 101st was the only airborne division to mark themselves thusly, any depiction of World War Two-era US paratroopers with painted symbols on the sides of their helmets can safely be assumed to be the 101st.) A diamond painted onto the side of the helmet signified the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, a heart the 502nd PIR, and a club the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment. However, thanks to the popular influence of the book and television show [[Band of Brothers]], most depictions will feature the [[spade_(shape)|spade symbol]] on the helmet that signified the the wearer to be part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. \r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[Band of Brothers]].\r\n* [[Unit Patch]]\r\n* [[506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (US Army)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":218875,"created_at":"2024-12-14T22:27:43.282-05:00","updated_at":"2024-12-14T22:27:43.282-05:00","title":"minotia_(dragon_ball)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ミノシア"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":20621,"created_at":"2010-06-29T15:24:20.645-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-14T22:05:38.205-05:00","title":"choujikuu_yousai_macross","body":"[b][i]Choujikuu Yousai MACROSS[/i][/b], translated as [i]Super Spacetime Fortress Macross[/i] (or more correctly, [i]Hyperspace Fortress Macross[/i]), also known in English as [i]The Super Dimension Fortress Macross[/i], is the first anime television series of the [[MACROSS]] franchise that first aired in Japan on October 3, 1982.

It features mechanical designs by [[Miyatake Kazutaka]] and Kawamori Shouji (both of Studio Nue) and character designs by [[Mikimoto Haruhiko]] of Artland. \r\n\r\nAccording to the creators of the show the series was heavily inspired by [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] and [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]], of which most of the production staff were fans.\r\n\r\nMacross also created one of the first anime idols [[Lynn Minmay]], turning her [[voice actor|voice actress]] \"Mari Iijima\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_Iijima into an instant celebrity, and launching her musical career. \r\n\r\nMost of its animation (with edited content, revised dialogue and a different soundtrack) was adapted outside of Japan for the first saga of [[ROBOTECH]], where it is known as [b]The Macross Saga[/b]. \r\n\r\nIn Japan the TV series were adapted into an acclaimed anime film called [[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]] that was released in japanese movie theaters during 1984.\r\n\r\nh4.
