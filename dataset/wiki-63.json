They are the evolution of Sleeper technology into the currently known technology base. In practical terms, they are expensive, powerful, and extremely customizable cruiser-sized ships.\r\nStrategic cruisers have four subsystem slots designed to create a single ship, each holding a part of the ship's basic layout and carrying its own set of bonuses. No strategic cruiser can be fielded if it lacks any of the four subsystem slots. Each race has developed its own set of subsystems for each ship, and these subsystems are not interchangeable between different races' strategic cruisers. Each subsystem has an associated skill, and when combined provide Strategic Cruisers with many more bonuses than any other ships.\r\nTo further improve their flexibility, strategic cruisers are also the only ships capable of having Rigs removed from them without destroying them, allowing a single strat cruiser hull to completely refit and change its role in a matter of seconds. To encourage on-the-fly reconfigurations (using a Mobile Depot for example), they also come with an extra cargo bay especially for storing subsystems. And to further encourage pushing the ships to their limits in the field, the main strategic cruiser skill itself does not provide direct combat bonuses, but instead reduces the overheat damage sustained by the ship's modules, and increases the speed of using Nanite Repair Paste to repair overheat damage.\r\nIt takes a lot of effort to build a strategic cruiser, and they consequently cost a lot. Most primary components of Tech 3 production are found in Wormholes, and some of the rarer gases and components are not available outside of Dangerous or Deadly Unknown systems.\r\nThe following are the strategic cruisers, by race:\r\n* [[Amarr Empire (EVE Online)|]] [[Legion (EVE Online)|]]\r\n* [[Caldari State (EVE Online)|]] [[Tengu (EVE Online)|]]\r\n* [[Gallente Federation (EVE Online)|]] [[Proteus (EVE Online)|]]\r\n* [[Minmatar Republic (EVE Online)|]] [[Loki (EVE Online)|]]\r\n\r\nh5.

They can also be purchased second-hand from players on the market. These ships require two different races' Spaceship Command skills to use. For example, the Dramiel, an [[Angel Cartel (EVE Online)|]] [[frigate (EVE Online)|]], requires both [[Minmatar Republic (EVE Online)|Minmatar]] and [[Gallente Federation (EVE Online)|Gallente]] frigate skills. However, they do not require high levels in these skills, making them considerably easier to train for than [[Tech 2 ship (EVE Online)|]]s.

To defend their home from zombies, some which have unique abilities, the player uses plants that can fire projectiles at, give \"sun\" to purchase other plants to help or block the advancing zombies. Players must plan defenses in multiple \"lanes\" across the home's lawn and should a zombie make it to the house on any lane, the game is over. Director George Fan was inspired to make the game after playing other tower defense titles and desiring to eliminate the typical strategies of sending advancing enemies through mazes of defenses, instead adapting the lane approach to remove this strategy.\r\n\r\n* [[Crazy Dave_(plants_vs_zombies)|]]\r\n\r\nh5.
