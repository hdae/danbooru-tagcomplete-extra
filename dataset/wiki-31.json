The equivalent English concept is [b]pretty boy[/b]. The term describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in Asia: a teenage boy, around 13 to 18 years old, whose beauty (and sexual appeal) transcends the boundary of gender or sexual orientation. Bishounen characters are fairly common in manga and anime; a heavy number of male characters show subtle signs of the bishounen style, such as slender eyes or a feminine face. \r\n\r\nBishounen are usually drawn delicately, with long limbs, silky or flowing hair, and slender eyes with long eyelashes that can sometimes extend beyond the face. It's best to tag images that focus on the character's beauty, so there tends to be a heavier emphasis on solo or duo images here. Group images are fine, so long as the majority of the males exemplify this trait.\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, the term is best used when you can still tell that the character is a male. If there are remarkable feminine traits, consider adding [[androgynous]]. For characters where their feminine traits are at the point of making you believe that they're a female, use [[otoko no ko]] instead.\r\n\r\nNote that with [[genderswap (ftm)|female-to-male genderswaps]], this tag can apply if they possess the above-mentioned traits.\r\n\r\nIn English-speaking circles, bishounen is used somewhat more loosely than it is in Japan, effectively used for any male character with pseudo androgynous beauty, regardless of whether they are \"shounen\" or not (so variants covering those older than 18, ala biseinen, bichuunen, and bidanshi, find themselves incorporated, as well as those younger than 13).\r\n\r\nh4.

The main stated reasons for this invasion were to eliminate Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, and promote democracy and stability in the region.\r\n\r\nThe Iraq War had its roots in the aftermath of the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. The U.S. government, under the administration of President [[George W. Bush]], argued that Iraq, under [[Saddam Hussein]], posed a threat due to its \"WMD programs\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#2003_Iraq_War and its potential to support terrorist organizations. However, the invasion and subsequent \"occupation of Iraq\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Iraq_(2003%E2%80%932011) faced significant \"controversy\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Iraq_War and \"opposition\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationale_for_the_Iraq_War, both domestically and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe conflict quickly led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, but the search for WMDs proved unsuccessful, and no substantial evidence of active WMD programs was found. The war also resulted in a \"protracted insurgency\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_insurgency_(2003%E2%80%932011), \"sectarian violence\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarian_violence_in_Iraq#Sectarian_violence_following_the_U.S._invasion, and the rise of extremist groups, including \"Al-Qaeda in Iraq\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_Iraq (later known as the \"Islamic State or ISIS\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State).\r\n\r\nThe Iraq War had a \"profound and lasting impact on the region\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#Impacts. It destabilized Iraq, causing \"significant loss of life\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War and \"displacing millions of people\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crises_of_the_Iraq_War. The war also strained U.S. relations with some of its allies and led to widespread protests and opposition to the war. It remains a topic of debate and analysis with regard to its justifiability, consequences, and long-term effects on the Middle East and international politics.\r\n\r\nh4.

She has [[large breasts]] and [[brown hair]] usually in [[short twintails|short]], [[low twintails]]. \r\n\r\nSanae is a former police officer who quit the force to become an idol, largely because the Producer convinced her. She is very flirtatious to the Producer and uses a lot of police terminology when talking. She wishes to be seen by other idols as an older sister and be called Onee-sama, despite the fact that she is shorter than idols who are half her age. Sanae has a black belt in Aikido, Judo, and Karate. She also tends to get upset if others mention that she is single, and is very easily susceptible to drinking to drown her sorrows.\r\n\r\nShe is in the upper tier for bust size, which is further enhanced because she's rather short. Her cards often reference that she wants to put the Producer in handcuffs, lock him up, and do an interrogation as a teasing double entendre.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Sanae is a former police officer. She sees herself as an older sister to her fellow idols and will go to great lengths to help promote this. She leads training lessons for [[Aino Nagisa]], [[Akanishi Erika]], [[Yagami Makino]], and [[Ohnishi Yuriko]]. While she finds it extremely difficult, Sanae continues to do so because she wants to be considered reliable. She puts other’s wants before hers, and can sometimes wind up looking like a fool because of it. She is nervous when it comes to [[Aihara Yukino]]’s high class tea and ceramics.\r\n\r\nSanae has a habit of getting drunk, and often drags other idols into it as well. She has found drinking buddies in [[Takagaki Kaede]], [[Hiiragi Shino]], [[Shinohara Rei]], and [[Hyodo Rena]] and made friends with [[Yanagi Kiyora]]. Sanae earned a movie role of an evil mahjong player, and in turn became one of [[Munakata Atsumi]]’s ogling victims. Her sense of style seems to mostly include extremely short dresses that show a lot of cleavage. She is said to be stunning in a bathing suit, although she has put on a child’s swimsuit in order to gain attention.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 8th CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Tachibana Arisu]], [[Ichinose Shiki]], [[Shiomi Syuko]], and [[Sakurai Momoka]]. She is voiced by [[Waki Azumi]] [和氣 あず未].\r\n\r\nh4.

Some of Kasen's actions, such as her avoidance of [[Ibuki Suika]], also contribute to the speculation.\r\n\r\nShe is often accompanied by her pets: [[Koutei (touhou)|]] the dragon, [[Kume (touhou)|]] the giant eagle, [[Kanda (touhou)|]] the young eagle, [[Mukou (touhou)|]] the raijuu, and [[Houso (touhou)|]] the tiger.\r\n\r\nSince both characters are hermits, Kasen is often associated with [[Kaku Seiga]], though usually on an antagonistic basis since Seiga is a \"wicked hermit\". \r\n\r\n[spoiler]Wild and Horned Hermit 35 revealed she is one of the Sages of [[Gensokyo]] alongside Yukari.[/spoiler]\r\n[spoiler]Wild and Horned Hermit 49 would not only introduce her severed arm given semi-physical form, [[Ibaraki Douji's Arm]], but Kasen herself would become one with her arm and fully become an oni once more, revealing herself to be one of the Big Four, [[Ibaraki Douji (Touhou)|Ibaraki Douji]].

A [[dragon girl]] in human form. Designed by [[Yaman]].\r\n\r\nShe has [[very long hair|very long]] [[orange hair]] with a single [[blonde hair|yellow]] [[streaked hair|lock of hair]] near her forehead. Her regular hairstyle is [[straight hair]] with an [[ahoge]], [[hair intakes]] held with a [[black hairband]], [[fanged bangs|fanged]] [[blunt bangs]], [[sidelocks]] and a [[side braid]]. She also has a pair of [[dragon horns]] with a [[horn bow|bow]] on her right horn, [[pointy ears]], [[red eyes]] with [[white pupils|white]] [[slit pupils]], a long purple [[dragon tail]] (which she had a running gag of it being a [[butt plug]] [[anal tail|tail]]). She also has quite [[large breasts]], with her subsequent outfits making them [[huge breasts|noticeably larger]].\r\n\r\nShe is fluent in English, and quite eccentric (due to being a half-American). Hosted a morning \"news show\"-esque 20-minute program on weekdays named \"AsaCoco\" (Morning Coco), which usually ended up creating absurd memes - such as [[Himemori Luna]]'s English Corner, where the cute, childish princess constantly spews out obscenities, and most notably the drug \"[[asacoco]]\", a potent stimulant available to be delivered in a wide variety of forms ranging from needles to anal plugs.\r\n\r\nDespite her wild antics, insane gags and frequent foul language (which often got her into trouble with YouTube), she is very eager to help her friends if need be and has a mature, big sister-like approach to troublesome situations (though usually laced with some of her personal brand of humor to break the seriousness if it's too much).\r\n\r\nShe was considered to have the second largest bust in hololive after [[Tsukumo Sana]], even toppling [[Shirogane Noel]]'s K-night cups. She was also significantly taller than the rest of the hololive girls (180 cm, compared with [[Omega Alpha]], who is the second tallest at 175 cm without counting the gigantic Sana), especially the rest of the 4th generation (Kanata, Towa and Watame are all about 150 cm tall, Luna is the shortest at 140 cm, boosted to 150 cm with her shoes and crown).\r\n\r\nShe was the real-life roommate of [[Amane Kanata]], and the apartment that they lived in together was called by other visiting hololive members as the \"KanaCoco House\". This means that they could (and had several times) make appearances on each other's streams.\r\n\r\nShe is in fact a big [[Ryuu ga Gotoku (series)|]] fangirl and has been known to play games of the series. In fact, her name and her title of \"Chairwoman\" (\"会長\" - [i]Kaichou[/i]) are direct references to [[Kiryu Kazuma]].\r\n\r\nKiryu Coco reached one million YouTube subscribers on February 17, 2021.\r\n\r\nShe announced her graduation from Hololive on June 8, 2021. Her final act was a live concert on July 1, 2021, which became one of the most viewed live streams in Hololive and VTuber history, reaching over 498,000 concurrent viewers.\r\n\r\nh4.
