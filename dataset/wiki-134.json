As such, his stories express a profound indifference to human beliefs and affairs. He is best known for his [[Cthulhu Mythos]] story cycle and the [[Necronomicon]], a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lovecraft's readership was limited during his lifetime, his reputation has grown over the decades, and he is now regarded as one of the most influential horror writers of the 20th century.

However, due to poor production, it unexpectedly became popular online. After the 「例のアレ」meme into China, this material was discovered by【美男(BiliBili ID)】, named it【潮汕英豪传（Legend of Chaoshan Heroes）】, and tried to learn from Niconico's creative style to develop it into a subculture similar to 【Gachimuchi】or【Inm】. \r\n\r\n【潮汕英豪传】has developed for the second time since 2018. Many of the main authors are Chaoshan natives (including the organizer of Chaoshan Touhou Only), who can easily understand the video content across the dialect barrier. This helps the development of this meme has been closer to subculture rather than only be a otomad material, and can build a set of world views and stories based on the original video. Therefore, the【潮汕英豪传】 can be said to be one of the few 「例のアレ」memes from  China，Or it can be called Chinese style「例のアレ」memes\r\n\r\nThe company is located in Jieyang City, Guangdong Province, China. Most of the actors in the film use local language, this dialect is called Chaozhou dialect(潮州話/潮汕話). In Southeast Asia, British colonists often heard the language spoken by immigrant laborers from the Chaoshan region.

They are usually the main antagonists in the fictional universe of [[Transformers]]. \r\n\r\nThese villainous transforming [[robot]]s can take many forms, and have many different origins and stories across the numerous different Transformers media, but in almost all incarnations, they are led by [[Megatron]]. They are typically represented by the purple facial insignia they all wear. Primarily, [b]Decepticons[/b] have red eyes, while their enemy [[Autobot]]s have blue eyes. They are usually known for their air power, especially since many of them turn into [[aircraft]]. Decepticons often turn into [[military]] vehicles, construction vehicles, and even smaller-than-human-sized objects. \r\n\r\nIn [[Japan]]'s version of the franchise, the Decepticons are called [b]Destron[/b] or [b]Deathtron[/b] (Japanese: デストロン Desutoron). The one exception to this naming convention is Car Robots, where the sub-group referred to as \"Decepticons\" in the Robots in Disguise adaptation, is known in Japan as the Combatrons (the Japanese name of the G1 subgroup known as the Combaticons). The overall name of the Robots in Disguise villain faction is [b]Destronger[/b]. However, the Japanese version of Transformers Animated uses Decepticon (ディセプティコン). \r\n\r\nThe title Decepticons is derived from the word [i]\"deception\"[/i] in the English language. \r\n\r\nh4.Known Decepticons \r\n\r\n* [[Megatron]] \r\n* [[Galvatron]] \r\n* [[Cyclonus]] \r\n* [[Shockwave (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Starscream]] \r\n* [[Slipstream (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Skywarp]] \r\n* [[Thundercracker]] \r\n* [[Ramjet]] \r\n* [[Sunstorm (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Acidstorm (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Thunderblast]] \r\n* [[Soundwave (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Soundblaster]] \r\n* [[Laserbeak]] \r\n* [[Buzzsaw (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Rumble (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Ravage (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Frenzy (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Ratbat (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Blitzwing]] \r\n* [[Astrotrain]] \r\n* [[Bombshell (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Shrapnel (transformers)|]]\r\n* [[Kickback (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Blackarachnia]] \r\n* [[Lockdown (Transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Barricade (Transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Blackout (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Lugnut (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Bruticus]] \r\n** [[Swindle (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Brawl (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Onslaught (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Blast Off (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[Vortex (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Leozack]] \r\n* [[Knockout (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Eagle Eye (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Terrorsaur]] \r\n* [[Ransack (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Devastator (transformers)|]] \r\n** [[scrapper_(transformers)|Scrapper]]\r\n** [[Mixmaster]]\r\n** [[Bonecrusher]]\r\n** [[hook_(transformers)|Hook]]\r\n** [[scavenger_(transformers)|Scavenger]]\r\n** [[long_haul_(transformers)|Long Haul]]\r\n* [[Unicron]] \r\n* [[Trypticon]] \r\n* [[Tarn]]\r\n* [[Overlord (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Snare (transformers)|]] \r\n* [[Sixshot (transformers)|]]\r\n* [[Battleslash]]\r\n* [[Roadtrap (transformers)|]]\r\n* [[viper_(transformers)|Viper]]\r\n\r\nh4.
