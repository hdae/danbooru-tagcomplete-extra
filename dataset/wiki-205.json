The plot of Ninja Spirit is based on the quest of his revenge in an alternative feudal Japan.\r\n\r\nNinja Spirit was successfully ported onto multiple platforms. The most popular port is the [[pc_engine|TurboGrafx-16]] format which includes two styles of mode: the PC Engine mode which provides a lengthy healthbar, and the Arcade mode, which is a more challenging mode where the ninja dies with the slightest contact. That version was ported to the [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]]'s Virtual Console on May 14, 2007, was delisted on March 30, 2012 and was available again on September 17, 2013 in Japan and on September 19, 2013 in North America and Europe.\r\n\r\nNinja Spirit later appeared in the Japan-only [[Game Boy]] title, Shuyaku Sentai Irem Fighter along with other characters from the game, as well as characters from three other Irem franchises: [[R-Type]], Mr. Heli and Hammerin' Harry.\r\n\r\nNinja Spirit for the Turbografx-16 is notable because it was the first game in history to receive a perfect score (10) in a video game magazine, \"The 1991 Video Game Buyer's Guide by Electronic Gaming Monthly, in 1990.\":http://www.defunctgames.com/reviewcrew/24/ninja-spirit-what-did-the-critics-say-in-1990\r\n\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":["最後の忍道"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":60353,"created_at":"2014-11-19T04:42:17.492-05:00","updated_at":"2015-04-13T13:15:12.146-04:00","title":"type_a_kou-hyouteki","body":"A midget [[submarine]] used by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["甲標的"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64541,"created_at":"2015-04-13T12:13:34.529-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-13T12:13:34.529-04:00","title":"aiz_wallenstein","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アイズ・ヴァレンシュタイン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64540,"created_at":"2015-04-13T11:49:06.380-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-13T11:49:06.380-04:00","title":"daru_(artist)","body":"Ambiguous tag.\r\n\r\n* For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[daru_(n89)]].\r\n* For some other artists named daru: \"daru_*\":/artists?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search[name]=daru_*&search[sort]=Date&commit=Search | \"*_daru\":/artists?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search[name]=*_daru&search[sort]=Date&commit=Search search","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64539,"created_at":"2015-04-13T11:47:46.171-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-13T11:47:46.171-04:00","title":"niconicozombie","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Daru_(n89)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64532,"created_at":"2015-04-13T01:32:32.282-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-13T01:32:32.282-04:00","title":"minegasaki_yaeko","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["峰ヶ崎八重子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64527,"created_at":"2015-04-12T20:16:54.703-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-12T20:16:54.703-04:00","title":"sarukomea","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Annin_Musou]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64517,"created_at":"2015-04-12T16:25:39.907-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-12T16:25:39.907-04:00","title":"badou_nails","body":"[[Dogs: Bullets & Carnage]] character.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["バドー・ネイルズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64514,"created_at":"2015-04-12T16:18:51.155-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-12T16:18:51.155-04:00","title":"fake_nails","body":"A set of small plastic molds that can be glued to the [[fingernails]] and painted with [[nail polish]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64510,"created_at":"2015-04-12T16:06:47.846-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-12T16:06:47.846-04:00","title":"polka_dot_swimsuit","body":"A [[swimsuit]] with a [[polka dot]] pattern.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64507,"created_at":"2015-04-12T16:01:09.088-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-12T16:01:09.088-04:00","title":"torn_swimsuit","body":"A [[swimsuit]] that has been torn, yet is still being worn.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64506,"created_at":"2015-04-12T15:56:27.076-04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-12T15:56:27.076-04:00","title":"taut_swimsuit","body":"A [[swimsuit]] that is too tight or small for the wearer.
