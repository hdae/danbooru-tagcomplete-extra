The Neo Geo Pocket Color was released on March 16, 1999 in Japan, August 6, 1999 in North America, and some time in 1999 in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Neo Geo Pocket Color was SNK's last video game console, and is backwards compatible with the Neo Geo Pocket. In 2000, following SNK's purchase by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze, the Neo Geo Pocket Color was dropped from both the North American and European markets. It did, however, last until 2001 in Japan, with a total of 2 million units sold.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":40012,"created_at":"2012-11-09T23:17:08.769-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:12:26.716-04:00","title":"kagu_(pixiv3538617)","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Kagu (a hazy moon)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":40014,"created_at":"2012-11-09T23:34:01.210-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:12:26.429-04:00","title":"yumeurahumi","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[mochino (yumeura fuumi)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":40018,"created_at":"2012-11-10T00:17:00.534-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:12:25.888-04:00","title":"negi_funmatsu_jouzai","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[negi (yozakura teien)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":40024,"created_at":"2012-11-10T01:43:30.530-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:12:24.713-04:00","title":"negi_(pixiv729440)","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[bannou negi]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":40049,"created_at":"2012-11-10T12:41:52.031-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:12:22.221-04:00","title":"chypre_(heartcatch_precure!)","body":"\"シプレ\":http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_mode=s_tag&word=%E3%82%B7%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%20%E3%83%8F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%83%E3%83%81%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A5%E3%82%A2 \r\n\r\n[[Hanasaki Tsubomi]]'s fairy partner in [[Heartcatch Precure!]].
