The game features a conflict between the [[Global Liberation Army]] (GLA), an organization resembling a [[terrorist]] group, and the superpowers of the [[China|People’s Republic of China]] (China) and the [[united states|United States of America]] (USA). \r\n\r\nThe game operates in a similar manner to other titles in the [[Command & Conquer]] series, where players construct bases, train units, acquire resources on one of the game's maps to fund their operations, and then defeat their opponents by eliminating their bases and armies. It is the first Command & Conquer RTS game to use 3D graphics in-game. The game takes place in an entirely separate continuity that is completely unrelated to the [[command & conquer: red alert 2|Red Alert]] universe or the [[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun|Tiberium]] universe.\r\n\r\nAn expansion pack titled [i]\"Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_&_Conquer:_Generals_%E2%80%93_Zero_Hour][/i] was released in September 2003, adding several new abilities and units to each side, and a new mode of play called Generals' Challenge, along with a lot more changes, new features and bug/glitch fixes.\r\n\r\nThe series has received controversy from media watchdogs due to its national stereotyping and the ability to play as a terrorist-like organization, particularly during the height of the \"War on Terror\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror. Longtime Command & Conquer fans also objected to the association of their franchise with a game that resembled other real-time strategy games more than traditional Command & Conquer gameplay. \r\n\r\nDespite this, the game received positive reviews from fans and critics for its solid and action-packed gameplay, as well as receiving praise for the humorous and memorable voicelines for many of its units. It has since gained a cult following, with fans of the series continuing to develop mods that change the gameplay significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. See Also\r\n\r\n* [[Command & Conquer]]\r\n\r\nh4.

Along with Westwood's previous RTS game Dune 2 (based on the sci-fi series [[Dune (series)|]]), the early C&C games helped codified the RTS genre.

This ends up causing a timeline with a stronger Soviet Union that invades Europe.  The two initial factions were the Allies and the Soviet Union.

It featured new semi-3D graphics, a more futuristic [[science fiction]] setting, and new gameplay features such as vehicles capable of hovering or burrowing. \r\n\r\nThe main story of the game focuses on a second war between the UN-backed [[Global Defense Initiative]] (GDI) and the cult-like [[Brotherhood of Nod]], both seeking to rule over an [[earth_(planet)|Earth]] which is undergoing rapid ecological collapse.\r\n\r\nTiberian Sun was one of the most anticipated games of 1999. Its development suffered numerous delays, with several features being cut before release. However, it was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics, despite some of the technical bugs in the game. The dark atmosphere, foreboding soundtrack, and slow paced gameplay of Tiberian Sun received a mixed reception from fans upon release, although have earned it a cult following since. Its story of a military-industrial complex preoccupied with [[terrorism]] rather than environmental failure has been hailed as a metaphor for modern times. \r\n\r\nSeveral additional features were added to the game with the Firestorm expansion pack, including new units and a multiplayer global war mode.

It can also be considered a style of [[meme]].\r\n\r\nIn the most common form, many rows of fixed-width ASCII characters are arranged to depict a [[logo]], above which appears a picture of a character or object, usually with a speech bubble beside it. Artists often make use of [[emphasis lines]] to give context to their subject. The defining feature of this [[meme]] is that no two components of the image can match. Quotes, onomatopoeia, artist [[commentary|commentaries]], tags, [[furigana]], and so on: no matter how many elements go into the image, each one is from a different source. Aside from the text, the picture itself often combines several characters into a kind of [[chimera]]. For example, the earliest known example of this [[ASCII art]] depicts a creature with [[Juushimatsu Juushoku]]'s head and the body of a dog, with a speech bubble saying \"meow!!\" and the caption \"chick\".\r\n\r\n[[2channel]] users often deploy these pictures to defuse tensions in heated discussion threads full of arguments and flaming. Posting a Mujun-Gatamari usually carries an implicit meaning of \"C'mon, you guys, chill out.\" In these cases, posters often introduce their image with a catchphrase meaning \"殺伐としたスレに~が!! (Into the bloody fray of this thread, *** has arrived!!)\" This usage originated with another [[ASCII art]] character, [[youkan_(food)|Youkan]] Man. Images of cheerful Youkan Man, who keeps on smiling no matter how many times he is cut in half, were once a popular option for calming down flame wars. Now, however, posters eschew this [[ascii art]] as something that just makes everyone angrier.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[out of character]] - some of [[out of character]] images on pixiv & NicoSeiga are incorrectly tagged as [[mujun-gatamari (meme)|]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Adobe, recognizing that Flash lost its relevance over time, announced in 2017 that in-browser Flash plugins would no longer be supported after December 2020; all major browsers permanently removed Flash support by the end of January 2021.\r\n\r\nDuring its lifetime, Adobe made a change to the Flash player after version 9 that broke many older files. As of now, the 51 posts with this tag have been fixed by flipping a flag in the header, as detailed in topic #15331, but if such a file was found, it was recommended to try and view it in version 9's stand-alone player.\r\n\r\nAs of March 2021, Danbooru is set up to automatically load all Flash posts using Ruffle.js, which uses \"WebAssembly\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly] to emulate Flash in modern browsers as a part of the broader \"Ruffle Project\":[https://ruffle.rs].
