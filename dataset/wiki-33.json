She is the first [[Korea|Korean]] character in the Street Fighter series, and the only one that uses [[Taekwondo]] so far. She is voiced by [[Kitamura Eri]] in Japanese and Jessica Strauss in English.\r\n\r\nShe is described as being an \"evil, mean and nasty\" member of S.I.N. who is a main character in the SFIV storyline. The character was created by request of many Korean fans who wished for [[Capcom]] to add a Korean character in Street Fighter, something already established by [[SNK]] and [[Namco]]. \r\n\r\nShe is depicted as being overtly [[sadism|sadistic]] and often makes denigrating and [[sexually suggestive]] remarks toward her opponents. [spoiler]According to [[Menat]], this cruel demeanor is simply a facade to hide her emotional pain and suffering as a result of her traumatic experience after her parents were killed by [[m. bison|M.

Her creation is also seen as a rib to [[The King of Fighters]] as all the Korean characters in that franchise, particularly [[Kim Kaphwan]], are either representatives of Justice or evildoers who redeem themselves, while she is (at least initially) a servant of evil. \r\n\r\nh4.

May also apply to male-to-[[futanari]], but since futanari is not wholly female, female-to-futanari may also qualify. A being with no sex depicted as any of these may technically count.\r\n\r\nThis tag can also be applied to an [[otoko no ko]] if the character is given female traits such as the presence of actual [[cleavage]] or the obvious absence of a [[bulge]] at the crotch. For [[reverse trap]]s, the absence of cleavage or presence of a bulge applies.\r\n\r\nIf a character is genderswapped often enough, the genderswapped version may be given its own name. For male-to-female genderswaps, this is often the normal character's name with \"ko\" appended to it. (子 \"Ko\" meaning \"child\" is a common ending for Japanese girls' names.) For female-to-male genderswaps, \"o\" is sometimes added. \r\n\r\nKnown in Internet circles as Rule 63, wherein there is a female or male version of any given male or female character, respectively.\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b] \r\n* If the person has only swapped bodies with another from the opposite sex, but the body itself has not changed, then use [[personality switch]] instead.\r\n* The \"女体化\" tag may also on occasion be used to describe female [[personification]], rather than a genderswap.\r\n* If a character in canon is genderswapped but rarely shown in their original form (such as [[Mai Natsume]] or [[Tanya Degurechaff]]), the tag only applies if said original form is included or somehow alluded to.\r\nh4.

Released on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]], Z3 marks the first HD release in the SRW series. Like it's [[super robot wars z2|predecessor]], Z3 was released in two parts, the first (Jigoku-hen) in 2014 and the second (Tengoku-hen) in 2015. A third segment (Rengoku-hen) was available for a limited time through redemption codes included in first print copies of Tengoku-hen. This third segment is set between the two main games, and focuses primarily on the original aspects of the story.\r\n\r\nDespite the graphical update, the Z3 games have faced criticism from fans due to many units and series being cut from the previous games, and a heavier focus on the original story elements as opposed to series roster's stories. Almost every series that debuted in the first game was notably absent in this entry.\r\n\r\nh1.

When in doubt use the [[futanari]] tag instead.\r\n\r\nOn Danbooru, futa without pussy was previously referred to with the word \"newhalf\". Newhalf is a Japanese slang word for a pre-op or non-op male-to-female trans person, also referred to as \"shemale\" (シーメール). The word \"newhalf\" was originally used for referring a male who had begun to transition to female but kept her lower body the same; literally a \"new half\". Due to Danbooru's usage of the word not reflecting its real world usage, functionally using it more as a synonym for \"futa without pussy\", the tag was renamed to use that instead. The fates of the related tags below that still use the \"newhalf\" name have yet to be decided.\r\n\r\nh4.
