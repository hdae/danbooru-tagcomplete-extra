At this point, any special attack would knock Umehara's character out if connected, since special attacks deal chip damage even when blocked. In an attempt to win the round, Wong attempted to hit Umehara's Ken with Chun-Li's multihit Super Art move Houyoku-sen (鳳翼扇). \r\n\r\nHowever, instead of avoiding it, Umehara chose to \"Parry,\" a technique whereby an incoming attack is blocked without the player losing any health, but doing so requires moving the toward opponent's direction in the same time a hit lands, within 10 frames of the impact animation. After the move was launched, not only were all 15 hits Parried, but Umehara also managed to counter with a punishing combo that dealt just enough damage to win the match. \r\n\r\nThis moment, and the ecstatic cheering of the spectators that followed, was recorded and later spread on the Internet, gaining immense popularity, and is often credited as one of the catalysts that popularized the competitive fighting game community.\r\n\r\nKnown in Japan as \"[b]The Desperate Comeback[/b] (背水の逆転劇)\" or \"[b]Let's go Justin[/b]\", the latter a reference to a phrase yelled out by an unseen person in the crowd at the beginning of the full parry.

The war was triggered by Ba'athist [[Iraq]]'s invasion and annexation of [[Kuwait]], which was seen as a threat to the security of the neighboring countries and the global oil supply.\r\n\r\nA coalition of 34 countries, led by the [[United States]], formed to oppose [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq's aggression and to liberate Kuwait. The coalition included several Arab countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], as well as Western countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Canada]]. The coalition launched a massive military operation to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, known as Operation Desert Storm.\r\n\r\nThe war began with a series of air strikes on Iraqi military targets, followed by a ground offensive. The coalition forces achieved a quick and decisive victory, and Kuwait was liberated from Iraqi occupation. The war lasted for less than six months, with the majority of the fighting taking place between January and February 1991.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf War had significant political, economic, and social consequences. It marked a turning point in the global politics of the Middle East, as well as in the use of military force to resolve international disputes. The war also had a severe impact on the civilian population, with thousands of Kuwaiti civilians and Iraqi civilians being killed or displaced.\r\n\r\nThe war also led to the imposition of sanctions on Iraq, which remained in place for over a decade, and had a significant impact on the country's economy and population. Additionally, the Gulf War led to the deployment of US military forces in the region, which has had a lasting impact on the politics and security of the Middle East.\r\n\r\nh4.

Replacing the bolt-action [[M1903 Springfield]] and [[M1917 Enfield]] rifles, the Garand was the first semi-automatic weapon to be designated as the primary weapon of any army, and saw service with American troops on all fronts of [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. \r\n\r\nThe weapon is loaded via an eight-round [[clip (weapon)|en-bloc clip]] inserted from the top, and makes a distinctive and famous \"ping\" sound when ejecting the clip after the last round has been fired. The Garand can also be reloaded mid-clip, either by opening the action and inserting loose rounds or by manually ejecting the partially-spent clip and loading a fresh one. \r\n\r\nThough the M1 was officially replaced by the [[M14]] rifle in 1958, which married the action of the M1 with the magazine capacity of the [[M1918 bar|Browning Automatic Rifle]], the Garand was not fully replaced in active-duty service until 1965, and remained in specialist sniper or reserve roles into the 1970s. The Garand also saw extensive action during the [[Vietnam War]] as the primary weapon of both the [[Republic of Korea Army]] and the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] until the late 60s. It continues to be used by drill and ceremonial teams today, and have even been found in modern-day conflicts such as the [[War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]].

Generally used in the sense of: 1. To finish a given [[horse girl]]'s training scenario in the [[Umamusume]] game; 2. To get along very well or \"buddy buddy\" with a given girl (or [[Kiryuin Aoi]]); or 3. To \"go all the way\" or do all sorts of implied hanky panky things with a given girl (or again, [[Kiryuin Aoi]]). \r\n\r\nEffectively used as a euphemism in most fan comics, especially in 'comedic' scenarios, where it usually involves a girl going [[yandere]] on the [[Trainer (umamusume)|]] and alleging the latter [i]umapyoi[/i]-ing the other girls. Occasionally it is [[Happy Meek (Umamusume)|]] accusing [[Kiryuin Aoi]] (of going out with the [[Trainer (umamusume)|]]), as a reference to one of the in-game events.\r\n\r\nA common variation used by fans (but not in official media) is \"onsen umapyoi\", occasionally abbreviated to \"onsenpyoi\" (温泉ぴょい). This can refer to either: 1. to finish a given [[horse girl]]'s training scenario with the semi-secret hot spring event unlocked, which requires the player to randomly acquire the Hot Spring Tickets in that scenario and win the URA final, or 2. from the above, to \"go all the way\" at the hot spring [i]ryokan[/i] with a given girl (or, yet again, [[Kiryuin Aoi]]). \r\n\r\nSince the release of the Aoharu training mode, [[Kashimoto Riko]] has joined [[Kiryuin Aoi]] in the list of possible umapyoi-ees (or, alternatively, umapyoi-ers).\r\n\r\nThe song also features other 'nonsensical' portmanteau words such as [i]umadacchi[/i], [i]sukidacchi[/i] and [i]umapoi[/i] (without the 'y'), all of which are also co-opted by the fanbase for pretty much the same meanings as [i]umapyoi[/i] above. As such, these examples can also be tagged umapyoi.\r\n\r\nUsage of all these four words has also spread to other fanbases.\r\n\r\nThis tag should generally not be used when the words occur as part of the [[Umapyoi Densetsu]] song, i.e. the characters are singing the song normally in their original context.\r\n\r\nh4.

Due to the nature of things, it is unlikely for those automatic changes to be reversed. (forum #122820)\r\n\r\nAs a result, post with such sources have automatically received the [[non-web source]] tag, due to their now-textual nature.\r\n\r\nThis tag is for such posts (as well as those posts that were manually desourced from their original by users uploading). If possible, the sources should be standardized for ease of access (forum #152518), if not restored if in any way possible. Posts which have had their sources changed to either their original first-party source, a different text source, or to nothing cannot reasonably be accounted for.\r\n\r\nh4. Guidelines\r\n\r\n* [[Bad ID]]'s guideline on when the source field can be changed apply here.\r\n* If the source is changed to the image's original first-party source (resourcing), assuming the source in question is still active, and the md5/EXIF data might not match, please use topic #16765 to get the post replaced.\r\n* For first-party sources that aren't available anymore ([[bad ID]]), check tools such as SauceNAO and ascii2d, as to see if a link to them can still be obtained (though in such a case, this tag could arguably be retained on the post in question, due to how imageboards can potentially change that data; or if not, substituted with [[MD5 mismatch]] where appropriate).\r\n* Always compare when the Danbooru post was uploaded relative to the source that might be used for resourcing:\r\n** Sources such as yande.re, Zerochan, et al can often postdate the Danbooru post by minutes or even months, despite having the same MD5 and not linking to Danbooru (an indication that they aren't the source, but rather got it from the same source Danbooru did, whether the same imageboard or even the same user);\r\n** Some sources may not calculate time the same as Danbooru: Danbooru localizes to your local time, while for example yande.re uses UTC; so when comparing dates, always check whether they are in the same time zone.\r\n\r\nh4.

Best known for a scene in which the leader of the Spartans, [[Leonidas I]], tells off a Persian messenger with the iconic words \"[[This is SPARTA (meme)|]]\", before throwing him down a well.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie was a commercial success, it was generally disliked by Greeks and Iranians for the bastardization of their historical figures of each respective sides, along with numerous other historical inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nThe movie would later have a sequel in 2014, [b]300: Rise of an Empire[/b], based on Frank Miller's then unpublished prequel comic, [i]Xerxes[/i], which would not be released until 2018.

When the segment's three-year run concluded, Hansen continued to host similarly formatted shows on other networks.\r\n\r\nAfter parting ways with NBC in 2013, he began hosting Killer Instinct on Investigation Discovery in 2015, a short-lived series that documented homicide investigations.
