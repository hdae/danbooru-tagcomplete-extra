After successfully pitching [[Waluigi]] for N64 Mario Tennis, the team at Camelot (such as designer [[Aoki Fumihide]]) attempted to pitch a similar 'warui' counterpart for [[Princess Peach]], reaching the design phase for their second attempt during [[Mario Power Tennis]]. The concept would be rejected by Nintendo due to their belief that any design for her would not be appealing, or resemble [[Yatterman]]'s [[Doronjo]] (in part because of Waluigi's resemblance to [[Boyakki]]).\r\n\r\nFor years, her design wasn't shown to the public, with fans being inspired by the idea to create their own designs of Warupeach. On December 1st, 2023, the Power Tennis design for Warupeach (or [b]Walpeach[/b]) would be shown off to the public, by way of Aoki's Instagram, featuring the alternate name of \"Priech\" (プリーチ). The black-and-white concept art would be paired with images of an \"in-color 3D model\":[https://archive.is/fK3Ts] (rendering her outfit in purple). Aoki would go on to try and answer many \"questions\":[https://twitter.com/GenesisJam_/status/1730803149915472217] on Warupeach regarding design choices and personal ideas for her in the comments of the two Instagram posts, but would private his socials after being overwhelmed by the attention he was receiving.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her planes are [[F8F Bearcat]]s armed with Tiny Tim rockets that has floats applied for scouting and attacking purposes, launched from a teddy bear familiar to her back.\r\n\r\nIn real life, she received an [[aircraft catapult]] for a float plane in place of her aft torpedo mount and one of her main guns, allowing the ship to launch a Kingfisher scout observation plane. The catapult turned out not to be operationally suitable for the intended purpose and was ultimately removed from Halford in October 1943. However, in World of Warships, she get her catapult back while having her AA Defenses upgraded and she participated during Leyte Gulf. The Aircraft she carried are Floatplane versions of the [[F8F Bearcat]]s.\r\n\r\nh4.

Although it has generally declined in real life, it still has many followers and remains popular in various Japanese media, particularily the manga & anime industry.\r\n\r\nIt has many diverse substyles, with some commonalities. Gyaru style typically involves styled and coloured hair, trendy and often sexy gyaru-style clothing (especially from the shops in the mall Shibuya 109), and heavy makeup, with a focus on false [[eyelashes]], enlarging the eyes, contouring, and circle lenses. Additionally, many gyaru use the \"gyaru-moji\" (ギャル文字) style of typing and certain specialized slang (ギャル語). There are also certain common hobbies among gyaru: dancing [[Para Para]] was at one time a very popular activity in gyaru circles.\r\n\r\nTwo common elements of gyaru looks, especially in anime and manga representations, are tanned skin ([[ganguro]] - especially for older or throwback styles) and bleached hair. However, not every gyaru has tanned skin or bleached hair, and not every character with tanned skin and bleached hair is a gyaru.\r\n\r\nIn mainstream media, gyaru are usually depicted as either an energeric or an extroverted character, while adult media depicted either as a high-school student [[prostitution|prostitute]] or a character with unusually high sex drive.\r\n\r\nMale [[gyaru]]s are known as [[gyaruo]]\r\n\r\nh4.

The real life factions are replaced by fictional counterparts (such as Empire of Japan being called as \"Sakura Empire\", United States as \"Eagle Union\", etc.)\r\n\r\nUnlike KanColle, the game has made an effort to distance itself from WW2 in most aspects in order to appeal to a broader audience, pushing for most fantastical designs, the implementation of collabs unrelated to WW2 naval history, the release of shipgirls based on fictional warships without proper historical precedent, post-war era warships, WW1 warships, dark versions of its existing shipgirls (METAships), shipgirls from the Age of Sail, child and idol variants of its characters, and so on.\r\n\r\nh4. Media\r\n\r\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. [[Azur Lane: Crosswave]], a [[PlayStation 4]] / PC game, was released in 2019. A TV anime adaptation aired during Fall 2019. The game has also held an annual collaboration with [[World of Warships]] since 2017. [[Azur Lane: Slow Ahead]], a slice-of-life [[4koma]] series, was adapted into an anime in early 2021.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\n[i]Azur Lane[/i] was launched on May 25th, 2017 in China, on September 14th, 2017 in Japan, on March 27th, 2018 in Korea, on August 16th, 2018 in English, and around September 2019 in Taiwan. As of 2024, the number of players registered surpassed at least 41 million.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging\r\n\r\nDon't tag shipgirls with [[mecha musume]], [[personification]],  [[World War II]], or [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], unless these things are present outside of the shipgirls themselves.\r\n\r\nShipgirls of the same class may be tagged as [[sisters]], see forum #239409 and topic #24859.\r\n\r\nh4.

Despite setbacks and financial losses that could've ruined the developer a few months into the game's relaunch, \"the CEO continued to invest in the game\":https://www.khgames.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=235475, taking out loans when necessary, and ended up finding success within the casual playerbase after its first anniversary.

Mega Man was produced by a small team specifically for the home [[game console]] market, a first for Capcom, who previously focused on [[arcade]] titles.\r\n\r\nThe game begins the struggle of the [[android]] and player-character [[Mega Man (character)|]] against the mad scientist [[Dr. Wily (mega man)|]] and the six \"Robot Masters\" under his control. Mega Man's nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in a boss battle against one of the Robot Masters that awards the player-character a unique weapon. Part of the strategy of the game is that the player must carefully choose the order in which to tackle the stages so that they can earn the weapons that will be most useful for future stages.\r\n\r\nCritics praised Mega Man for its overall design, though the game was not a commercial success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that would define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs in the [[Mega Man (classic)|]] franchise. \r\n\r\nThe first game has since been featured in game compilations, including Mega Man Legacy Collection for Windows, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Nintendo Switch]], rereleased on mobile phones, and become a part of console emulation services.

She loves experiments, and is motivated by finding new things to hold her attention; if it's not interesting, she's not interested. Rather than being scouted by Producer, she chose him as part of one of her experiments. She sniffed the Producer and his smell convinced her that he was the right one for the experiment. She became an idol for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt's implied she uses pheromones to attract fans, and even in idol form, her hair looks messy and uncombed.\r\n\r\nIn the 11th Magic Hour SP, she revealed that she went to an American university before being an idol, but she got bored of it and returned to Japan. She attends a Japanese high school and lives on her own. She likes tabasco sauce and her forte is chemistry, but she dislikes wasabi and waking up early.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Shiki is introduced by [[Yanagi Kiyora]]. Her sniffing habits show up as early as her first line and her “Nyahaha” laugh appeared soon after. She seems to be friends with [[Sagisawa Fumika]] and [[Jougasaki Mika]], who both also know of her nose. Her smelling often causes her to fall asleep and she highly regards the Producer’s jacket as a source of soothing smells. Shiki got a job as a background character in a Wild West film.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 8th set of CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Tachibana Arisu]], [[Shiomi Syuko]], [[Katagiri Sanae]], and [[Sakurai Momoka]]. She is voiced by [[Aihara Kotomi]] [藍原 ことみ].\r\n\r\nh4.

The hilt has a noticeably large cross-guard in relation to the pommel, and interestingly, it is somewhat reminiscent to the seal of the royal family. The blade has a large ricasso (unsharpened blade portion near the hilt suitable for a second grip), although Link is never portrayed using it in any of the games.

Introduction\r\n\r\nIn here you will find the meaning behind most of the terms Danbooru users use. This also covers terms of other sites relevant to the Danbooru.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Dictionary\r\n\r\nh5. User actions\r\n\r\n* [b]1up[/b] - When a better version of an existing post is uploaded, especially if the existing version hadn't been approved yet and ends up deleted because the new one was better. Was commonly seen with Pixiv posts 1upping Twitter posts back when Twitter reduced the quality of images.\r\n\r\n* [b]Gardening[/b] - Curating items by adding/removing/changing data, this term is usually applied to any edit action done in bulk, such as on:\r\n** \"artists\":/artists\r\n** \"artist commentaries\":/artist_commentaries\r\n** \"notes\":/notes\r\n** \"pools\":/notes\r\n** \"posts\":/posts - This includes edit actions on posts other than adding/removing tags.\r\n** \"tags\":/tags - Adding them to posts that should contain them or removing them to posts that shouldn't.\r\n** \"wiki pages\":/wiki_pages\r\n\r\n* [b]Sniping[/b] - When someone uploads an artwork with few tags in an effort to be the first uploader. This is usually frowned upon.\r\n\r\n* [b]Mintagging[/b] - Tagging an upload with the bare minimum of tags or below; usually associated with sniping, but can also be a sign of laziness which is also frowned upon.\r\n\r\n* [b]Nuke[/b] - Completely deleting a tag, usually done through a BUR.\r\n\r\nh5. Users\r\n\r\n* [b]Contributor[/b] or [b]Contrib[/b] - In a way, everyone who contributes to the site is a contributor, but this term refers to users whose uploads are automatically set as active ([[Help:Users]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Gold+[/b] - a short way of saying \"Gold level or higher\"\r\n\r\n* [b]Janitor[/b] - This term usually refers to approvers ([[Help:Users]]). \r\n\r\n* [b]Moderator[/b] - Users at the Moderator+ levels, who moderate the actions of users ([[Help:Users]]). Be aware that many of the people who approve/disapprove posts are Approvers but are not Moderators.\r\n\r\n* [b]Platinum-[/b] - A short way of saying \"Platinum level or lower\"\r\n\r\n* See [[help:users]] for a list of the different levels.\r\n\r\nh5. Posts\r\n\r\n* [b]Appeal[/b] - If you think a deleted post is undeserving of deletion, you can appeal it ([[Howto:appeal]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Blacklist[/b] - Danbooru hides posts if they contain a tag from your blacklist ([[Help:Blacklists]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Purged[/b] or [b]Expunged[/b] - Usually deleted posts are still on the server, so they can be undeleted if there was a mistake, or blocked from being reuploaded if not. Expunged posts are completely erased and gone for good, for example, post #6. This usually only happens in extreme circumstances—for example, illegal content.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] The primary reason this is not usually done is that it makes it possible to reupload the exact same image, which would now be unbanned/undeleted.[/tn]\r\n\r\n* [b]Flag[/b] or [b]Flagged[/b] - if a post is low quality or breaks the rules, you can flag it for deletion ([[Howto:Flag]])\r\n\r\n* [b]Hard Translated[/b] - When a translation is applied directly onto the image ([[hard-translated]]). Danbooru's notes system allows translators to put translations in boxes floating over the image without changing the file itself; this is called a [b]soft translation[/b].\r\n\r\n* [b]Normalized Source[/b] - When Danbooru uses the data provided from specific direct image links to give you normal sources that take you to the original post, eg. <https://i.pximg.net/img-original/img/2019/08/19/05/04/43/76340480_p0.png> brings to <https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/76340480>.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] This is only possible for sites where the original post is embedded in the image link somewhere.[/tn]\r\n\r\n* [b]Parent[/b] and [b]Child[/b] - A way to group together different versions of similar posts, or related posts ([[Help:Post relationships]])\r\n\r\nh5. Tags\r\n\r\n* [b]BUR[/b] - Stands for \"Bulk Update Request.\" By filling out \"this form\":[/bulk_update_requests/new], you can request one or more aliases, implications, or mass updates between tags.\r\n** [b]alias[/b] - When two tags mean the same thing, one can be set as an alias of the other, so that the aliased tag gets automatically changed to the destination tag on every post using it, and searching for the aliased tag searches for the destination instead ([[Help:Tag aliases]]).\r\n** [b]implication[/b] - When the presence of one tag will always mean a second tag should be added to the image, the first can be set to imply the second ([[Help:Tag implications]]).\r\n** [b]mass update[/b] - Changing one or more tags. For example, [[kancolle]] -> [[kantai collection]] would remove [[kancolle]] and replace it with [[kantai collection]] to all posts which contain the [[kancolle]] tag.\r\n** [b]rename[/b] - Renames a tag, moving all of its wiki and history data to the new name.\r\n** [b]category[/b] - Changes the category of a tag. Required on all tags with a post count greater than 1000, or those going to or from the [b]Meta[/b] category.\r\n\r\n* [b]Pet Tag[/b] - A tag created and maintained by a single user, which usually has narrow or confusing guidelines (for example arbitrarily omitting certain kind of artworks) and has low value to other users in its present state.\r\n\r\n* [b]Qualifier[/b] - A word in parenthesis used as suffix for tags that have the same name, for example [[arrow_(projectile)]] and [[arrow_(symbol)]], or [[shimakaze (kancolle)|]] and [[shimakaze_(azur_lane)]]. Qualifiers are also used on artists that share name with other artists or tags, for example  [[hammer]] and [[hammer_(sunset_beach)]]. See [[help:qualifiers]] for more information.\r\n\r\n* [b]Tag Script[/b] - Not an actual script! A special mode that users with Gold level or higher can use to add/remove tags from posts just by clicking on their thumbnails ([[Help:Tag scripts]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Umbrella Tag[/b] - A generic tag that several specific tags imply. For example, [[rose]], [[daisy]], and [[sunflower]] each imply [[flower]].\r\n\r\n* [b]Utility Alias[/b] - An alias which doesn't move any post, made to improve searchability. For example, [[japanese sweets]] is aliased to [[wagashi]], because it's an uncommon word in english. This allows people to find the tag without having to google what japanese sweets are called.\r\n\r\nh5. Other\r\n\r\n* [b]+1/-1[/b] - \"I agree\"/\"I disagree\"\r\n\r\n* [b]DMail[/b] - Private message (Direct Mail).\r\n\r\n* [b]DText[/b] - Text formatting system used for comments and forum posts ([[Help:DText]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Feedback[/b] or [b]User Feedback[/b] ([[Help:User records]])\r\n\r\nh5. Danbooru site\r\n\r\n* [b]API[/b] or [b]API Key[/b] or [b]API Limits[/b] - If you use external programs with Danbooru (for example mass downloaders or userscripts), the API is how they communicate with the site. The API Key lets your program do things that require an account; using the key tells the site that it's coming from you. The API Limit is how quickly the program is allowed to do things on the site. This limit exists to reduce the risk of massive site vandalism. See [[Help:API]] for more information.\r\n\r\n* [b]Booru[/b] - Danbooru is the name of both this website and the site's behind-the-scenes software.

Initially named Air Combat as it’s Namco System 21 arcade original.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first Ace Combat console game, the setting of the games take place in a world similar to Earth but with a radically different history, countries, geography, and having mixed existence of both real and fictional aircraft, as well as exponentially advanced technology, superweapons, submarines, and airships that are larger than life. This world is known as \"Strangereal\". Two major events have shaped many of the events of the mainline Ace Combat games: The [[ace_combat_zero|Belkan War]], and the [[ace_combat_04|Ulysses Impact]].\r\n\r\nThe typical Ace Combat plot follows a nameless/faceless fighter pilot's rise from a fledgling rookie to become a feared and respected ace in the war he is fighting, but told in narrative perspective of the people surrounding the pilot. The pilot in question will also typically face off against \"rival\" aces from the opposing nation. The music in the series has been composed by quite a few talented people within Bandai Namco sound team, with Tetsukazu Nakanishi, Hiroshi Okubo, and Keiki Kobayashi among them. Who also worked on other projects such as [[Tekken]], [[Ridge Racer]], and [[SoulCalibur]].\r\n\r\nh4.
