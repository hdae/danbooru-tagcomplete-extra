Her sniper rifle allows for a scope zoom with varying magnifications, making her the ART with the longest reach in all the game. This is somewhat downplayed by her limit of 3 shots per time, although a lucky player may be able to cripple the target with them.\r\n\r\nRinka Lynx was originally a Garapon Bot, however two variations of her were added to the shop: a orange-haired version with 3 Tune-Up slots per part and a black-haired version with a single slot per part. Those two, while their stats are identical to those of the original, come with an incredibly nerfed Sniper Rifle, rendering her sniper gameplay pratically useless. However, all her sniper rifles can be swapped between her variations, therefore a player with an useless rifle can swap her with another more useful one if he manages to obtain another Rinka variation but doesn't wishes to swap robots.\r\n\r\nSince Rinka was released alongside [[Kururu Gradd]], Kururu is often seen as Rinka's \"Partner Bot\", much like [[Melfi]] and [[Elisalotte]], even though they have no storyline together, or storylines at all. Their only connection, which in itself is still questionable, is Kururu's \"Rinka Chainsaw\" Wonder Bit.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["リンカー・リンクス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":59540,"created_at":"2014-10-22T11:03:25.014-04:00","updated_at":"2014-10-22T11:03:25.014-04:00","title":"mitabi","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nTumblr: http://mitabi.tumblr.com/ (deleted)","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":55714,"created_at":"2014-06-28T21:07:51.606-04:00","updated_at":"2014-10-22T10:43:22.152-04:00","title":"durian","body":"The King of Fruits.\r\nInfamous for its strong smell, but also famous for its heavenly taste.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ドリアン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":59538,"created_at":"2014-10-22T09:19:41.678-04:00","updated_at":"2014-10-22T09:19:41.678-04:00","title":"haku-un","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Hakuun_(m2230)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":59535,"created_at":"2014-10-22T06:18:40.180-04:00","updated_at":"2014-10-22T06:18:40.180-04:00","title":"emi_(emi3yoyoyo)","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Antera_(emi)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":59531,"created_at":"2014-10-22T05:36:25.671-04:00","updated_at":"2014-10-22T05:45:45.854-04:00","title":"viera_(sennen_sensou_aigis)","body":"(Not clear if there's an official romanisation)\r\nSailor Viera is a character in [i][[Sennen Sensou Aigis]][/i].\r\nShe has [[long hair|long]] [[blonde hair]] and [[large breasts]].\r\n\r\nh4.

In-game, Mialy is an Artillery Bot introduced in the Inventor Gara with a cat theme and obviously focused in fan-service, with long, red hair tied in [[twintails]] and thin clothes that barely cover her chest and leave her panties exposed.\r\n\r\nMialy and Rouche are constantly trying to outsmart each other by building the best weapons, although their competition apparently always ends in a draw. Mialy focuses on powerful railguns and Pursuit Bits, portable railguns whose purpose is to follow and eliminate designed enemies without endangering the user. Her constant inventions resulted in 6 alternate versions in-game with different, but similar, weapons: Type.X, Type.H, HW, WD and Type.T.\r\n\r\nSome time after Mialy invented her Type.X weapons, she met [[Illumis]], a young inventor who viewed her as a role model, and who soon improved so much along with Rouche that Mialy, struggling to keep up, built Type.H. Soon, Illumis also joined the competition, being on par with Rouche and Mialy, but also helped Mialy when possible, leading to several breakthroughs, as stated in Illumis' Type.Q's description.\r\n\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":58251,"created_at":"2014-09-06T16:52:46.230-04:00","updated_at":"2014-09-06T17:43:50.601-04:00","title":"sonokawa_momoka","body":"Main character of [i][[Sabagebu!]][/i].\r\nShe has a [[pink hair]] in a [[ponytail]] and [[pink eyes]].
