It was also one of, if not, the deadliest battle in history of warfare, with the Siege of Leningrad (also during WWII) being another contender.\r\n\r\nToday, the Battle of Stalingrad is universally regarded as the turning point in the European theatre of war, as it forced the Oberkommando der [[Wehrmacht]] (German High Command) to withdraw considerable military forces from other areas in occupied Europe to replace German losses on the Eastern Front, ending with the rout of the six field armies of Army Group B, including the destruction of Nazi Germany's 6th Army (more than a million men) and an entire corps of its 4th Panzer Army.

Unlike with [[unofficial Sailor Senshi uniform]], which just has one base design, Precure has multiple uniform designs for its main Cures and some villain teams. This is why the tag uses the term [i]costume[/i] rather than [i]uniform[/i] so that all of the designs for each series can be covered here.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t include merely an alternate color or an adaptation of an existing costume. The designs for both the character and clothing should be entirely different and not canon. This is usually depicted with fan designs for characters who never become Cures wearing their own unique adaptation of an existing uniform. It is possible for an existing Cure to [[cosplay]] as another one to the point of changing their hairstyle and adding/reducing embellishments to match the character they’re cosplaying. Another possibility is a [[light persona]] or [[dark persona]] being depicted in a fan made uniform based off of an existing one.\r\n\r\nThis tag could go hand-in-hand with [[alternate universe]] if it is a full-on scene of a fanmade character design interacting with canon characters, rather than a character just standing there showing off an outfit (post #1400262).\r\n\r\nConsider adding [[in-franchise crossover]] if the fan design for one series’ Cure(s) is directly based off of another series’ Cure(s).

Unlike [[help:tags|tags]] or [[help:post relationships|parent/child relationships]], the posts in a pool have a specific order.\r\n\r\nPools are typically for series of related images, such as [[comic]]s or sets of related images by an artist. These pools are called [b]series[/b] pools and have purple-colored names.\r\n\r\nAnother use of pools is for collections of posts that share a common, subjective theme. These pools are called [b]collection[/b] pools and have blue-colored names. Some of these pools are organized under the [[pool groups]] page.\r\n\r\nh4. Rules\r\n\r\n* Don't create pools for personal collections of your favorite posts. Use [[help:favorite groups|favorite groups]] for that. Personal pools will be subject to deletion in topic #8282.\r\n* Avoid creating collection pools when a tag would do.\r\n\r\nh4. Howto\r\n\r\nh6. Name a pool\r\n\r\nSeries pool names should generally follow the format \"Copyright - Title (Artist)\". \r\n\r\n* If the pool spans multiple series, you can use \"Various\" as the copyright.\r\n* If the pool contains images by multiple artists, you can use \"various artists\".\r\n* If the pool has an unknown artist (e.g., for official art pools), you can omit the artist part.\r\n* If the pool title is not English, you can either translate it or use the original language title. Unicode characters are supported in pool names. \r\n* If the artist has not given a title to the series, try to pick something relevant to the series.\r\n* If the pool is a sample of a series, add [sample] after the title.\r\n\r\nh6. Create a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the \"Pools\":/pools page in the top menu, then click on \"New\":/pools/new in the top submenu. Type the name of the pool, set its category, and write a description of it. Click submit to create the pool.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tag a post with [code]newpool:name[/code], where [code]name[/code] is the name of the new pool.\r\n\r\nh6. Add posts to a pool\r\n\r\nClick on [b]Add to pool[/b] from the post's page. A window will pop up where you can search for the pool you want by typing part of its name.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tag a post with [code]pool:<name>[/code] to add it to a pool. For example, to add a post to the \"Disgustingly Adorable\":/pools/903 pool, you could tag the post with {{pool:Disgustingly_Adorable}} or {{pool:903}}.\r\n\r\nLastly, you can go to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, then add the post's ID in the [b]Posts[/b] field.\r\n\r\nh6. Remove posts from a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, search for the post's ID in the [b]Posts[/b] field, and remove the ID from the list.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tag a post with [code]-pool:<name>[/code] to remove it from a pool. For example, to remove a post from the \"Disgustingly Adorable\":/pools/3550 pool, you could tag the post with {{-pool:Disgustingly_Adorable}} or {{-pool:903}}.\r\n\r\nh6. Modify a pool's order\r\n\r\nClick the [b]Order[/b] link at the top of the page while viewing the pool. You can then drag and drop the posts into the correct order.\r\n\r\nFor pools with over 1000 posts, the [b]Order[/b] link will not appear. To order these large pools, you should instead go to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, search for the IDs of the posts you want to reorder in the [b]Posts[/b] field, and reorder them within that text field.\r\n\r\nh6. Rename a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, change the [b]Name[/b] field, then click save.\r\n\r\nh6. Delete a pool\r\n\r\nGo to the pool's [b]Edit[/b] page, then click the [b]Delete[/b] link in the top menu, then click the confirm button. To undelete a pool, click the [b]Undelete[/b] button. Pools can be safely deleted and undeleted with no loss of information.\r\n\r\nDeleting and undeleting pools may only be performed by Builder-level users and above.\r\n\r\nh4.

They also announced a [i]SideM[/i] anime adaptation, with further details being revealed on \"315 Day\" (March 15).
