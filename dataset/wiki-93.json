This staff generally comes in three forms: [b]hooked[/b], in the shape of a shepherd's crook (curled off to one side); [b]tau[/b], in the shape of a T with downwards-curving arms topped by a small [[cross]]; and [b]serpentine[/b], with a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons curled back to face each other in an upwards-facing U with a small cross between them. \r\n\r\nThe [[fantasy]] version of the crosier tends to resemble a bastardized version of one (or several) of the above, with a small sphere or circular symmetrical  \"shepherd's crook\" bisected or topped by a large cross (the overall profile will often resemble a [[Celtic cross]]). Some versions may just be a large cross mounted on the end of a staff (with the whole staff resembling a [[Latin cross]], like the [[Pope]]'s [i]ferula[/i]). Another common fantasy variant has a scepter-like head topped off with a small cross.\r\n\r\n[[Priest]]s and fantasy [[priestess]]es are often depicted holding a crosier. Some may instead be depicted wielding a generic [[mage staff]]; such examples should not be tagged crosier.\r\n\r\nh4. Notable examples\r\n* [[Arch bishop (ragnarok online)|]] ([[Ragnarok Online]])\r\n* [[Pope_(ragnarok_online)|The Pope]] ([[Ragnarok Online]])\r\n* [[Martha_(fate)|]] ([[Fate (series)]])\r\n* [[Victorious_(azur lane)|]] ([[Azur Lane]])\r\n** Wields a golden crosier tipped with a sun cross, surmounted with a ship's bell.\r\n* [[Fan la Norne]] ([[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]])\r\n\r\nh4. Tag usage notes\r\n* Tag crosier for the priest's staff described above—both the real versions and the fantasy variants.\r\n** As a general rule, any fantasy staff that appears vaguely [[christianity|Christian]]-like (i.e. festooned with crosses and Christian motifs) will also tend to qualify.\r\n* Avoid tagging crosier for 'generic' looking staves that may be better off tagged [[staff]] or [[mage staff]].\r\n** Fantasy [[priest]]([[priestess|ess]])es are sometimes depicted holding a 'generic' crystal or gem-tipped staff without any religious trappings, one that would not look out of place being wielded by any other magic user. These examples should be tagged [[mage staff]] and not crosier.\r\n** Fire Emblem characters belonging to the priest or cleric class lines tend to just wield generic [[mage staff|mage staves]] because of [[Nintendo]] being allergic towards the depiction of crosses and other religious iconography.\r\n* [b]Do not[/b] tag [[shakujou]] (i.e. Buddhist staves) with crosier.\r\n* The [[Pope]]'s staff is a Papal ferula, but this can be tagged with crosier for now.\r\n\r\nh4.
