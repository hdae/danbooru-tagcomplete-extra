Directed by Keiichiro Toyama and written by Naoko Sato (previously known for the Siren series and the first Silent Hill), the core mechanic of the game is the player's ability to manipulate gravity, allowing unique movements and navigation. The graphics are cel-shaded, which in Toyama's opinion stand out from the western photorealistic trend.\r\n\r\nThe game started off back in 2008 as a PlayStation 3 project called Gravité, before being eventually transferred to PS Vita. AI and visuals were slightly simplified during the process. However, Gravity Rush director thinks overall Vita suits the game better, because of \"its handy and accessible nature\" and \"the impression of a different world existing beyond the screen\" the player gets by tilting the device.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is currently available exclusively in Japanese, though it has started to introduce some English-language graphical assets, and accessing the game for non-Japanese players requiring unconventional means.\r\n\r\nh4. Gameplay\r\n\r\nGameplay is centered upon building squadrons composed of individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. The player takes on the role of an [[Admiral (kancolle)|]] (提督 [i]teitoku[/i]) and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing.\r\n\r\nEach of the characters are moe [[personification]]s of [[World War II]] naval [[warship]]s, which are depicted as cute girls known as \"ship girls\" (艦娘, [i]kanmusu[/i]). These personified warships are based on real life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real life vessel.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the roster of the shipgirls was designed to be limited to the IJN and major players of the Imperial Japanese Army, and its final mission being an attack on the base, akin to how World War 2 played out for Japan. Due to the game's popularity, it has since introduced shipgirls from other Axis nations and wartime rival factions, including ships from the U.S. Navy, the British Royal Navy and even the somewhat-neutral Swedish Navy. \r\n\r\nAs of early 2022, KanColle features ships from following navies: Imperial Japanese Navy, Imperial Japanese Army, Maritime Safety Agency/Japan Coast Guard, United States Navy, British Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Dutch Koninklijke Marine, French Marine nationale, Italian Regia Marina, German Kriegsmarine, Военно-морской флот СССР, Swedish Svenska marinen, and Republic of China Navy. With the most numerous non-Japanese navies being United States Navy and Regia Marina.\r\n\r\nh4. Media\r\n\r\nThe game has developed into a much larger media franchise; various media including multiple manga series and light novels have been released, in addition to an officially licensed [[tabletop rpg|tabletop role-playing game]]. A [[PlayStation Vita]] game was released February 2016. A [[Kantai Collection (anime)|television anime adaptation]] aired Winter 2015, with a sequel season airing in 2022, and an anime movie was released in 2016. There is also a Japan only 3D arcade game [[Kancolle Arcade]] that was released in 2016.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe web browser game was launched on April 23, 2013, originally designed to run in Adobe Flash. An Android app version was released on August 1st, 2016. As of January 2015, the game had 2.5 million registered players. The game migrated to HTML5 prior to worldwide decommissioning of Adobe Flash in browsers.\r\n\r\nh4.

It serves as another major source of images on Danbooru.\r\n\r\nThis page will describe how to upload from DeviantArt, in addition to how to handle new artist entries in the case an entry doesn't already exist for the artist you're uploading a work from.\r\n\r\nh4. Uploading\r\n\r\nHere's the ideal procedure when uploading a DeviantArt artist:\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Upload with the \"danbooru bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], or paste in the URL of the work you wish to upload in the upload page. This way, you don't have to upload the image from your computer and risk it being an [[image sample]]. For more technical details, you may expand the following:\r\n\r\n[expand]\r\nUpload from DeviantArt (not from your computer) with the [b]full image URL[/b] if possible. On the right side, there should be a link to the URL labeled \"Download\". If it's not there, zoom into the picture as much as possible and copy the image URL from there. \r\n\r\nSince Danbooru supports direct linking to the image URL, the source URL should look like one of the following:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nhttp[i]:[/i]//[b]orig[/b]10.deviantart.net/b1f7/f/2015/169/1/b/1b095k69ceedwac54177e18132g8a084-d8xbdx0.jpg\r\nhttp[i]:[/i]//[b]orig[/b]09.deviantart.net/cb07/f/2015/172/f/1/k_by_sampleartist-d4kso7f.png\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nOr if the original source URL cannot be accessed for whatever reason (that is, when the download button will not be present):\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nhttp[i]:[/i]//[b]img[/b]14.deviantart.net/2d53/i/2015/156/a/c/___sample_work___by_sampleartist-d8w7vhm.jpg\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nDeviantArt has reduced-size versions of its images known as [[deviantart sample]]s, none of which should be uploaded here. Your source URL should not look like these:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nhttp[i]:[/i]//[b]pre[/b]03.deviantart.net/31ed/th/pre/f/2015/172/f/1/k_by_sampleartist-djy6akj.png\r\nhttp[i]:[/i]//[b]pre[/b]07.deviantart.net/1a1f/th/pre/f/2015/169/1/b/1b095069ceedfacfdty177e18132b8a084-d4dudx0.jpg\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Use the artist tag detected by Danbooru under Related Tags, if there is one. If not, follow the rest of this howto to create a new artist tag.\r\n\r\n* Do a [[help:cheatsheet|source:*username* search]] for the DeviantArt username. The username is usually found in image source URL. For example, search {{source:*shirononochiko*}} if the source URL is http[i]:[/i]//orig00.deviantart.net/e1d7/f/2013/096/7/2/nonexistent_work_by_[b]shirononochiko[/b]-gj83sbo8.png.\r\n* If you find any posts and they already have an artist tag, use that tag. You will need to update the artist entry so that Danbooru will automatically detect the artist tag for future uploads. See [b]Artist Entries[/b] to learn how to do this.\r\n* If this search didn't turn up any posts, or you find posts but they don't have an artist tag, then you will have to make a new artist tag yourself. Edit the post and add [b]artist:artist_name[/b] to the tags. See [b]Artist Naming[/b] for advice on choosing a name. After making a new artist tag, you will also have to create an artist entry. See [b]Artist Entries[/b] to learn how to do this.\r\n\r\nh4. Artist Naming\r\n\r\nThe first choice is to use the artist's full real name, if you can find it. On the main profile under the artist's username, there should be a section that shows the artist's real name, gender, and location. The name should have both a first and a last name. If it's in non-English letters, follow Danbooru's [[howto:romanize|romanization guidelines]]. Otherwise, check any personal websites or blogs they may list in their DeviantArt profile. See [[help:artists]] for advice on finding the artist's name on their website.\r\n\r\nThe second choice is their DeviantArt username.\r\n\r\nh4. Artist Entries\r\n\r\nAfter creating a new artist tag, click the '?' next to the artist tag in the tag list to create a new artist entry. In the artist entry add:\r\n\r\nh6.

Colloquially by fans and in-game they are all usually just referred to collectively as demons. Use the general [[Demon (Megami Tensei)]] tag whenever they are featured in posts.\r\n\r\nFor Danbooru purposes this tag is exclusively used for the set of mainline games and [[Megami Tensei]] is used for the overarching franchise.
