With political support, the shogunate would come to its official end and Imperial power would be restored, remembered as the Meiji Restoration. Shortly thereafter, the [[Boshin War]] began in 1868, and later that year, Edo was renamed to Tokyo, the Emperor was crowned in October, and officially the [i]Keiō[/i] era was formally changed to the Meiji era. The Boshin War ended in Imperial victory in 1869.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of hasty modernization and westernization, as Japan transitioned from being a feudal society to an emergent regional great power by Western standards.

It was a long era spanning the majority of the 20th Century and generally divided into periods before and after the end of [[World War II ]] and the subsequent occupation era.\r\n\r\nThe first half was defined by militaristic Imperial Japan's involvement in several wars, especially the two World Wars.\r\n\r\nThe second, post-war age is when restored democratic Japan became an economic power and the era ended with Japan in the midst of an economic bubble. When the Japanese say something is Shouwa-like and nostalgic, they usually mean something from the [[1980s (style)|]], [[1970s (style)|]], or possibly [[1960s (style)|]].\r\n\r\nIt was succeeded by the [[Heisei]] era.\r\n\r\nh4.

They are lobe-finned fish (from where tetrapods come), as opposed to the most common ray-finned fishes.\r\n\r\nThey are easily distinguished by their large rhomboidal anal fin, and their characteristic second dorsal fin which is lobed; ray-finned fishes either don't have a second dorsal fin, or it's not lobed.

In Dream SMP, his character is the estranged son of [[Wilbur Soot]].\r\n\r\nHis persona is an [[furry male|anthropomorphic]] red [[fox boy|fox]] who wears a [[white shirt]] with a black [[open jacket]], and a black [[kepi]].\r\n\r\nHis hat is modeled after [[Kujo Jotaro]]'s, though the cosplay tag should only be added if the hat is a direct match, as to avoid flooding the tag. The easiest way to distinguish the hats is by the shape of the hat ornaments: Fundy's has an L shape (post #8007010), while Jotaro's is rectangular (post #8064715).\r\n\r\nh4.

Intro\r\n\r\nYou can annotate images with notes. This is primarily used to translate text. Please do not use a note when a comment would suffice.\r\n\r\nIf you have an issue with an existing note or have a comment about it, instead of replacing the note, post a comment. Comments are more visible to other users, and chances are someone will respond to your inquiry.\r\n\r\nh5. Create\r\n\r\nYou can toggle the note creation mode via the [b]Add note[/b] link in the sidebar. You can also [b]press the 'n' key[/b] on your keyboard.\r\n\r\nClick and drag on the image to create an empty note. You can also simply click the image to create a note of a preset size. You can drag this note inside the image, and you can resize the note by dragging the small triangle on the bottom-right corner of the note.\r\n\r\nh5. Move/resize hotkeys\r\n\r\nClicking a note enables its movable mode. Once engaged, the border will turn blue, moving the cursor away will make the note transparent, and the arrow keys can be used to control its position. Using shift plus the arrow keys can be used to control its size. Clicking the note again will turn the movable status off. Clicking any other note transfers the movable status to the other note.\r\n\r\nIf you are just moving a pre-existing note and not changing text, you need to open the pop-up box and click save for the note's new position to be saved.\r\n\r\nh5. Edit\r\n\r\nWhen you mouse over the note box, the note body will appear. You can click on the body with \"[b]Click to edit[/b]\" or note caption and another box will appear where you can edit the text. Unlike most of Danbooru, note editing uses HTML instead of DText. All HTML code will be sanitized. You can place small translation notes by surrounding a block of text with [code]<tn>...</tn>[/code] tags. [tn](see [[About:Note formatting]] for other things you can do)[/tn]\r\n\r\nThis box will also contain five links:\r\n\r\n* [b]Save[/b] - This saves the note to the database.\r\n* [b]Preview[/b] - This allows you to see what the note will look like once rendered, but will not save the note.\r\n* [b]Cancel[/b] - This reverts the note to the last saved copy. The note's position, dimensions, and text will all be restored.\r\n* [b]Delete[/b] - This removes the note from view. It does not remove it from the database; you can undelete a note by reverting to a previous version.\r\n* [b]History[/b] - This will redirect you to the history of the note, where it is possible to view and revert to its former versions. All versions of the note are saved and not destroyed, so you can always revert to an older version from the history page.\r\n\r\nYou can copy all notes to another post via the [b]Copy notes[/b] link in the sidebar. This link only appears beside posts which currently have notes.\r\n\r\nh5. Search\r\n\r\nFrom the \"notes search page\":[/notes/search], you can search by various methods.\r\n \r\n* [b]Body:[/b] Searches for the text that gets displayed in the notes. Using * in the search converts it to a raw string search, allowing for HTML or CSS markup to be found.\r\n* [b]Author:[/b] Searches by the creator of the note.\r\n* [b]Tags:[/b] Searches by the tags of the post that the note is on.\r\n* [b]Other:[/b] Adding the following manually to the URL will add additional functionality.\r\n** [b]search[post_id][/b] The post ID the note is on.\r\n** [b]search[creator_id][/b] The creator's user id.\r\n** [b]search[is_active][/b] Can be: true, false\r\n\r\nh4.

The drawings are called \"frames\" because their position in time is measured in frames on a strip of film. A sequence of keyframes defines which movement the viewer will see, whereas the position of the keyframes on the film, video or animation defines the timing of the movement. Because only two or three keyframes over the span of a second do not create the illusion of movement, the remaining frames are filled with inbetweens.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is a raw still shot that was used directly for the producing the animation. This covers parts, or even all of, the draft sketch to test out plot flow, pre-color scenes, cel that was used for the animation, or complete film still. It is primarily used to complete the animation, since key frames themselves do not show any movement; it is important however, if not most important in developing animations.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessarily same thing as [[anime screenshot]], which captures the final material in presented medium. Key frames in general strictly internal-use only.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese word 原画 ([i]genga[/i]) can mean \"key frame\", but more literally means \"original illustration\". Thus works tagged with this on Pixiv should not be automatically tagged as key frame here.\r\n\r\nSee also [[official art]], [[production art]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キーフレーム","关键帧"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":205985,"created_at":"2024-08-31T23:48:43.394-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-31T23:48:43.394-04:00","title":"urthr_(phantom_of_the_kill)","body":"Illustrator：はるまき","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ウルズ(ファンキル)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":99477,"created_at":"2018-07-19T11:10:23.927-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-31T23:13:21.926-04:00","title":"masked_man_(pokemon_adventures)","body":"The [b]Masked Man[/b], also known as [b]Mask of Ice[/b], is the main antagonist of the Gold, Silver and Crystal chapter of [[Pokemon Adventures|Pokémon Adventures]].\r\n\r\nh4.
