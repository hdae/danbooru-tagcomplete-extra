These memes and resulting interest in the manga itself would spark a boom in [[yaoi]] and [[yuri]] content that continues on to this day. It is often paired with [[Manatsu no yo no Inmu]] (Inmu-chu) and [[gachimuchi|Gachimuchi Pants Wrestling]] as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ), since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nFor April Fools 2023, an anime \"adaptation\" of the manga was announced, entitled Shin Yaranaika, to be produced by Anime Tokyo and Studio Leo, and directed by Itou Pierre, as a medium-length all-ages OVA. Later that month, more details on the project were revealed before a crowdfunding campaign was launched to aid in funding the project. The project would meet its crowdfunding goal in late May, and a release date for April Fools 2024 was announced later in October.\r\n\r\nh4.

A Ugoira is a Zip file of images, played back using a custom Javascript player.\r\n\r\nTo download a Ugoira, use the \"Save as video (right click and save)\" link beneath the image. This is a WebM conversion that can be played on regular video players, but is not lossless in quality.\r\n\r\nTo upload a Ugoira, paste the Pixiv URL into the source field on the upload page, or upload using the \"bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet]. Uploading a Ugoira file from your computer will not work.\r\n\r\nTechnically, a Ugoira consists of Zip file containing each frame in JPEG or PNG format, and a separate JSON file containing the delay between each frame. Since each frame has a separate delay, it's possible for a Ugoira to have a variable frame rate. A \"custom Javascript player\":[https://github.com/pixiv/zip_player] is used to play animations back. Since the JSON file containing the frame delays is separate from the Zip file containing the images, saving raw Ugoiras and playing them outside of a browser is difficult.\r\n\r\nUgoira is a custom format exclusive to Pixiv. Animations from other sites cannot be Ugoira.\r\n\r\nUgoira is often considered inferior to animations found on other sites due to Pixiv's limitations on uploading GIFs or MP4 videos. As a result, artists may convert their animations to GIFs before uploading, introducing [[gif artifacts|dithering]] and/or [[color banding]], and Pixiv's recompression process can introduce additional [[JPEG artifacts]], affecting the overall quality of Ugoira animations.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* topic #11108\r\n* topic #10712\r\n* [[emofuri]]\r\n* [[ugoira conversion]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["うごイラ","東方うごイラ","アニぱい","乳揺れ(うごイラ)","우고이라","動圖"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":99863,"created_at":"2018-08-01T21:01:51.307-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-27T12:21:30.275-04:00","title":"arms_under_breasts","body":"When both of a character's upper arms are underneath one or more of their breasts.\r\n\r\nOften seen with [[crossed arms]] or [[covering breasts]]\r\n\r\nWhen only one arm is under the breasts, see [[arm under breasts]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Pleased with the results, he sealed away her memories and continued to look for ways of speeding up his lord's revival.

He murdered the current head of the clan, [[Kagura Maki]], to break the seal's power.\r\n\r\nSometime after the 1995 tournament, he also decided to track the Three Sacred Treasures that previously defeated his lord.

It walked on four legs and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the Southwestern [[United States]], the majority coming from a geological deposit called the Red Beds of [[Texas]] and Oklahoma.
