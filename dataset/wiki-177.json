campaign hat (also campaign cover, drill instructor cover, drill sergeant hat, lemon squeezer, Montana Peak, Mountie hat, ranger hat, sergeant hat, Scouts hat and Smokey Bear) is a broad-brimmed felt or straw hat, with a high crown, pinched symmetrically at the four corners (the \"Montana crease\").\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is associated with the New Zealand Army, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the World War I ground forces of the United States Army, contemporary U.S. military drill instructors, US state police forces, park rangers (and from them, their logo-cartoon and mascot Smokey Bear), Boy Scouts, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the campaign hat is occasionally referred to as a Stetson, this is from its common manufacture in the late 19th century by that company. It should not be confused with the quite different Stetson hat type with a different brim and crease, commonly known as the cowboy hat, and which is more commonly meant by the term \"Stetson\" today. The campaign hat also should not be confused with a slouch hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral U.S. state police services (for example, the Utah Highway Patrol), and federal agencies (for example, the United States Border Patrol) wear campaign hats. These state troopers are responsible for state and interstate highway safety, and in this capacity are variously referred to in different states as State Police, Highway Patrol, State Patrol, and State Highway Patrol. So common is use of the campaign hat among state highway police that they are sometimes referred to as \"smokey bears\" or \"smokeys,\" after Smokey Bear the famous logo-character of the U.S. Forest Service. The only State Police agencies that do not employ the “smokey bear hat”, are the New York State Police, Connecticut State Police, New Jersey State Police, Texas Highway Patrol, Maryland State Police, New Mexico State Police, and the Michigan State Police. There is no direct association between the cartoon bear and the Highway Patrol; they both derive their hat styles ultimately from the U.S. Cavalry.\r\n\r\nMany other police agencies, including numerous county sheriffs' services including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, use campaign hats. Some local police use it for particular duties or divisions; for example, officers of the Los Angeles Police Department's and Chicago Police Department's mounted units employ the hat, and deputy sheriffs assigned as cadre of the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp wear campaign hats.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50987,"created_at":"2013-12-09T07:54:03.355-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:04.792-04:00","title":"brains_(pokemon)","body":"See [[brains and brawn (pokemon)|Brains and Brawn]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50988,"created_at":"2013-12-09T07:57:23.813-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:04.484-04:00","title":"brawn_(pokemon)","body":"See [[brains and brawn (pokemon)|Brains and Brawn]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50991,"created_at":"2013-12-09T12:12:09.921-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:04.250-04:00","title":"shochan1962","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[pottsu]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50992,"created_at":"2013-12-09T12:31:44.572-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:03.977-04:00","title":"taputya","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[hori shin]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50995,"created_at":"2013-12-09T13:55:51.350-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:03.705-04:00","title":"shiozaki_salt","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Shiozaki_Shio]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50996,"created_at":"2013-12-09T13:57:06.999-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:03.456-04:00","title":"shiozaki","body":"Ambiguous tag.\r\n\r\nFor the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Shiozaki_Shio]].\r\n\r\nFor some potential artists named shiozaki: \"shiozaki_* search\":/artists?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search[name]=shiozaki_*&search[sort]=Date&commit=Search | \"*_shiozaki search\":/artists?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search[name]=*_shiozaki&search[sort]=Date&commit=Search\r\n\r\nFor some characters named shiozaki: \"shiozaki_*\":/tags?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search[name_matches]=shiozaki_*&search[category]=4&search[hide_empty]=yes&search[sort]=date&commit=Search | \"*_shiozaki\":/tags?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search[name_matches]=*_shiozaki&search[category]=4&search[hide_empty]=yes&search[sort]=date&commit=Search\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50997,"created_at":"2013-12-09T15:35:00.659-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:03.135-04:00","title":"steven_donegani","body":"Canadian artist.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51000,"created_at":"2013-12-09T19:44:54.418-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:02.635-04:00","title":"kaikyoukaisou","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Hyoumon_(saihokutan)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51004,"created_at":"2013-12-10T11:05:17.825-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:01.800-04:00","title":"plasma","body":"This may refer to the \"plasma state of matter\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29 or to \"blood plasma\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma .","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51005,"created_at":"2013-12-10T11:17:14.800-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:01.557-04:00","title":"production_note","body":"Footnote used by artists for either coloring note, guides on how to draw, or for producing animation, such as cel number indicator and footnote.\r\n\r\nThis tag should be reserved for sketches and/or uncolored artworks, for most parts.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51013,"created_at":"2013-12-11T04:39:12.993-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:01.005-04:00","title":"manaita_petako","body":"真名板ペタ子\r\n\r\nAn [[original]] character by [[Moegi Nenene]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51015,"created_at":"2013-12-11T15:30:26.948-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:00.675-04:00","title":"kumacy","body":"[[Perona]]'s pet bear/zombie/stuffed toy in [[One Piece]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51019,"created_at":"2013-12-11T22:24:50.589-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:03:00.170-04:00","title":"gekka_oriuta","body":"月花檻唄 (げっかおりうた)\r\n\r\n[[Hirokawa Tomo]]'s one-shot [[eromanga]] in the August 2001 issue of Tatsumi-Shuppan's Comic Penguin Club Sanzokuban.

The weapon was fired from a small two-wheeled gun carriage which fired a rocket-propelled, fin-stabilized grenade with a shaped charge warhead, similar to the grenade of the Panzerschreck but not the same. Approximately 3,000 units were completed from 1943 to 1945. It was made in much smaller numbers than either the Panzerschreck, which was based on the American Bazooka, or the Panzerfaust, which was a disposable recoilless rifle firing an anti-tank grenade. This is partly because it was realized that a simple hollow tube with an ignition device was all that was needed to launch the 88 mm rocket, rather than an elaborate miniature artillery piece with carriage and breech. Due to the carriage and better sights, the accuracy was better, and the range more than double that of the Panzerschreck.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_Raketenwerfer_43","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51952,"created_at":"2014-01-27T22:08:26.159-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:33.339-04:00","title":"mori_anzu","body":"For the character formerly tagged here, see [[mori_an]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51957,"created_at":"2014-01-28T08:18:43.007-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:32.998-04:00","title":"esperanza_(wp)","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Tappa_(esperanza)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51963,"created_at":"2014-01-28T15:43:56.448-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:32.340-04:00","title":"asuko","body":"Pixiv ID: http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=2562306","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51965,"created_at":"2014-01-28T17:47:08.222-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:32.100-04:00","title":"hanarain","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Sarashina_Kau]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51968,"created_at":"2014-01-29T00:34:38.571-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:31.771-04:00","title":"color_trap","body":"A paint-based attack used by [[Miss Goldenweek]] in [[One Piece]] that influenses the emotions of the target.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51970,"created_at":"2014-01-29T01:29:33.413-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:31.494-04:00","title":"pixpixpix","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[shimita_(erode)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51974,"created_at":"2014-01-29T05:40:41.826-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:30.796-04:00","title":"drill_yashima","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[Sachiroyu]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51976,"created_at":"2014-01-29T08:08:42.945-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:30.485-04:00","title":"amenomurakumo26","body":"This tag moved to [[shirona_(amenomurakumo26)]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51987,"created_at":"2014-01-29T22:44:54.015-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:29.580-04:00","title":"nanto_kanaru","body":"This tag is possibly ambiguous because the nickname is used by several artists.\r\nIt's a wordplay for the Japanese phrase ”\"[i]nantoka naru[/i]”\":http://tangorin.com/general/%E4%BD%95%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B (to be able to manage somehow or another).\r\n\r\nFor the artist formerly tagged here, see [[nanto_kanaru_(canal_grande)]].\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51993,"created_at":"2014-01-30T20:31:33.623-05:00","updated_at":"2017-08-05T11:57:29.338-04:00","title":"benesse","body":"Benesse Corporation (ベネッセコーポレーション) is a Japanese education & publishing company.
