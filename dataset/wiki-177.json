She is one of the artists whose withdrawal is the most regretted and there are many voices wishing for her return. \r\n\r\nHer works, if spoken kindly about, could be said to have individuality, or if spoken negatively about may be said to be poorly drawn pictures. The unnatural left-over unpainted areas and each parts of the face that were drawn well, that stated \"These are just a joke by someone who is actually good at art\" versus \"These are simply the crappy art of someone who can't draw well\", which led to the unfolding of a lively debate on a certain online boards.

Because she withdrew from the SNS, her true identity is unclear anymore. \r\n\r\nOn Pixiv, there are many illustrations that resemble her work which have the tag \"幻想夜曲氏リスペクト (Homage for Gensou Yakyoku)\" attached to them. The titles and commentaries often contain parodies of her doujin titles.

Unlike the previous game, this installment features a proper crossover of [i][[Mighty No. 9]][/i], [i][[Azure Striker Gunvolt]][/i], [i][[gal_gun|Gal☆Gun]][/i] into a full-fledged game. In an attempt to bring the ill-received [i]Mighty No. 9[/i] into a positive light, this game's plot follows after the events of that game, where [[beck_(mighty_no._9)|Beck]] finds himself unable to leave the virtual-reality training program that Professor White had created for him to train Beck for future battles, which is where he runs into a teenage boy who resembles Gunvolt and claims to be the program's GM, challenging Beck to face off against his Septimal powers. Similarly, in [[Gunvolt]]'s scenario, while on a mission one night, he and [[joule_(gunvolt)|Joule]] gets sucked into the virtual-reality training by a blinding light that Beck was trapped in, except they were being challenged by Beck into a tournament to take him and Mighty Number siblings into battle.\r\n\r\nExpanding on its predecessor, [i]Mighty Gunvolt Burst[/i] features a full-length [i][[Mega Man (series)|]][/i]-esque campaign built around the \"Burst\" mechanic, where players can earn score bonuses for finishing off enemies in close-range, and features a robust weapon customization system where, depending on the character, can create various types of attacks for their character of choice with each character possessing unique abilities of their own. Initially, [i]Gal☆Gun[/i] was shown less prominently than the previous game, but eventually became featured along with the other two series through later updates and releases. Some of the other characters from each represented series, such as [[call_(mighty_no._9)|Call]] ([i]Mighty No. 9[/i]), [[acura_(gunvolt)|Copen]] ([i]Azure Striker Gunvolt[/i]), and [[kurona_(galgun)|Kurona]] ([i]Gal☆Gun[/i]) later made playable appearances as DLC characters for the game.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":48527,"created_at":"2013-09-01T19:22:04.166-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-28T01:05:15.995-04:00","title":"mighty_no._9","body":"[b][i]Mighty No. 9[/i][/b] is a side-scrolling action game, co-developed by \"Keiji Inafune\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiji_Inafune, Comcept LLC, and \"Inti Creates\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inti_Creates together with an all-star team of experienced [[Mega Man (series)|]] developers. It shares the spirit and DNA of the classic Mega Man series, while also introducing new innovative gameplay elements.\r\n\r\nThe game follows the titular Mighty No. 9, [[beck_(mighty_no._9)|Beck]], along with his companion [[call_(mighty_no._9)|Call]] as they their battle against the Mighty Numbers after a viral outbreak causes nearly every robot in America to go berserk and turn against mankind.\r\n\r\nThe project and its multiple stretch goals were successfully funded on Kickstarter from September 1st until October 2nd 2013 with more than $4,000,000 pledged. Its release date was originally planned for April 2015, but was delayed multiple times until it was finally released on June 21, 2016 for home systems. Meanwhile, it has yet to be released for any portable system.\r\n\r\nDue to a host of problems behind the scenes and the finished product coming out somewhat underwhelming, it is regarded as one of the worst games of 2016 and has been set as an example of crowdfunded projects gone wrong. With the negative reception towards the game and Inafune, [i]Mighty No. 9[/i] unfortunately ended up becoming his swan song and his company was bought out by [[level-5|Level-5]]. Despite this, Beck (and later the other Mighty Numbers) would go on to feature prominently in the [i]Mighty Gunvolt[/i] series of spin-offs, which have been met with much more positive reception.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was also tested as a remote minesweeper, but was too vulnerable to mines and too expensive. During the Battle of France, German engineers from the 1st Panzer Division converted 10 Panzer I Ausf Bs into demolition and mine clearing vehicles, using them to place timed charges on bunkers or minefields without losing the vehicle. The Waffenamt found the idea valuable, and ordered the B IV's development as a remote-controlled demolition vehicle. The first vehicles were delivered in 1942.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Borgward IV was much heavier than the Goliath, and carried a much larger payload. The Borgward IV was operated by radio and the Goliath was wire guided, due to the Borgward IV's much longer range a driver in the vehicle would bring it independently to its destination before dismounting and conducting it to its target by radio. When it reached the target, the vehicle would drop the charge and leave the danger area. This put Borgward IV operators in great danger. While the Borgward IV was armored, its armor was inadequate by 1942-43, and its larger size than the Goliath made it much easier to spot.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgward_IV","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":122155,"created_at":"2021-03-19T20:50:25.592-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T20:50:36.235-04:00","title":"moofie_(artist)","body":"Artist page for [[Moofie (vtuber)|]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":122153,"created_at":"2021-03-19T19:26:13.979-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T19:26:13.979-04:00","title":"fours_(artist)","body":"Furaffinity: https://furaffinity.net/user/fourssss/\r\nInkbunny: https://inkbunny.net/Fours\r\nNewgrounds: https://fours.newgrounds.com\r\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/fourssss\r\nPillowfort: https://pillowfort.social/Fours\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fours441","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":122151,"created_at":"2021-03-19T14:54:06.833-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T14:55:30.772-04:00","title":"arsanlin","body":"Original character of the [[taiwan|Taipei]] Municipal Government Bureau of Finance.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["230","230-chan","アーサンリン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":122148,"created_at":"2021-03-19T10:08:36.421-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T10:08:36.421-04:00","title":"yamanaka_koyomi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["山中暦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":122147,"created_at":"2021-03-19T10:07:35.627-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T10:07:35.627-04:00","title":"asanaka_yomogi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["麻中蓬"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":122146,"created_at":"2021-03-19T10:07:03.823-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T10:07:03.823-04:00","title":"gauma","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガウマ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":115872,"created_at":"2020-08-22T12:08:46.299-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-19T09:04:10.660-04:00","title":"skort","body":"A portmanteau of [[skirt]] and [[shorts]].

She is a hunter (adventurer) living in a pseudo-fantasy world.  In her previous life she died saving the life of someone important for the future of humanity, and as a reward a god granted her reincarnation into another world with enhanced abilities.  Her response on enhancing her abilities was \"Please, make my abilities average!\", as she already lived a life standing out and wished for a quieter life.  Her abilities though end up far from what she had in mind for average, with many aspects of her life determined by mid-range (average between the lowest and highest values), thus her new life is anything but average.\r\n\r\nMile is the alias of Adele von Ascham as she lives her life as an adventurer.  In her previous life her name was Kurihara Misato (栗原海里).
