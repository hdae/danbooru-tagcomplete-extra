Adobe, recognizing that Flash lost its relevance over time, announced in 2017 that in-browser Flash plugins would no longer be supported after December 2020; all major browsers permanently removed Flash support by the end of January 2021.\r\n\r\nDuring its lifetime, Adobe made a change to the Flash player after version 9 that broke many older files. As of now, the 51 posts with this tag have been fixed by flipping a flag in the header, as detailed in topic #15331, but if such a file was found, it was recommended to try and view it in version 9's stand-alone player.\r\n\r\nAs of March 2021, Danbooru is set up to automatically load all Flash posts using Ruffle.js, which uses \"WebAssembly\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly] to emulate Flash in modern browsers as a part of the broader \"Ruffle Project\":[https://ruffle.rs]. While this means you can view Flash posts without falling back on an outdated browser that's old enough to still support the original Flash Player, please keep in mind that Ruffle's core emulation of Flash [b]is still in an alpha state[/b] and it's less likely to work with files that are newer and/or more complex. See [[ruffle compatible]] for posts that have been manually confirmed to work with the version of Ruffle.js that Danbooru is currently using.\r\n\r\nh4.

He is often depicted as wearing a golden [[headdress]] with pheasant [[feathers]] and riding his horse, [[Red Hare]] while wielding a [[Fangtian Ji]].\r\n\r\nOriginally a subordinate of a minor warlord [[Ding Yuan]], he betrayed and murdered Ding Yuan and defected to [[Dong Zhuo]] in the early 190s. In 192, he turned against Dong Zhuo and killed him after being instigated by [[Wang Yun]] and [[Shisun Rui]] (fictionalized using [[Diao Chan]]), but was later defeated and driven away by Dong Zhuo's followers.\r\n\r\nFrom 192 to early 195, Lü Bu wandered around central and northern China, consecutively seeking shelter under warlords such as [[Yuan Shu]], [[Yuan Shao]], and [[Zhang Yang]]. In 194, he managed to take control of Yan Province from the warlord [[Cao Cao]], but Cao took back his territories within two years. In 195, Lü Bu turned against [[Liu Bei]], who had offered him refuge in Xu Province, and seized control of the province from his host. Although he had agreed to an alliance with Yuan Shu earlier, he severed ties with him after Yuan declared himself emperor and joined Cao and others in attacking the pretender. However, in 198, he sided with Yuan Shu again and came under attack by the combined forces of Cao and Liu, resulting in his defeat at the Battle of Xiapi in 199. He was captured and executed by strangulation on Cao's order.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lü Bu is described in historical and fictional sources as a nearly unchallenged and peerless warrior, he was also notorious for his unstable behaviour and brutish/ruthless behavior. He switched allegiances erratically and freely betrayed his allies. He was always suspicious of others and could not control his subordinates. All these factors  eventually became the reason of his downfall.\r\n\r\nh4.

He is commonly depicted as tall with big ears. Thanks to [i]Romance of the Three Kingdoms[/i], Liu Bei is widely regarded as the ideal benevolent and humane ruler who cared for his people and selected good advisers for his government, which attracts to his side many capable and heroic subordinates like [[Guan Yu]], [[Zhang Fei]], [[Zhao Yun]], [[Zhuge Liang]], and [[Pang Tong]].\r\n\r\nAlthough he was a distant relative of the Han imperial family, he grew up poor and impoverished, selling shoes and straw mats. He studied under [[Lu Zhi]] with [[Gongsan Zan]]. He gathered a militia army to fight the [[Yellow Turbans]] with [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], later participating in the coalition against [[Dong Zhuo]]. Following this, he joined his childhood friend Gongsun Zan and fought under him against [[Yuan Shao]], who then sent him to help [[Tao Qian]] against [[Cao Cao]]. Thanks to the support of the influential Mi and Chen families along with Tao Qian's last will, Liu Bei inherited the Xu Province. After his defeat against Cao Cao, [[Lu Bu|Lü Bu]] joined him, but betrayed him with Yuan Shu and seized Xu Province. Later Liu Bei joined Cao Cao and they defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Although he was treated well by Cao Cao, Liu Bei received a secret edict from the emperor to kill Cao Cao and rebelled. After a brief alliance with Yuan Shao, Liu Bei was quickly defeated by Cao Cao and had to fflee. He was sent by Yuan Shao to create uprisings behind Cao Cao's main base, and later joined his kinsman [[Liu Biao]]. After Liu Biao's death, Liu Bei and his supporters joined [[Liu Qi]] in Xiakou where they allied with [[Sun Quan]]. Together they opposed Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\r\n\r\nAfter Cao Cao's defeat, Liu Bei quickly took control of the majority of Jing Province and married Sun Quan's sister. Sun Quan then agreed to \"lend\" him Nan Commandery. Liu Bei later led his army to join another kinsman, [[Liu Zhang]], in his war against the warlord [[Zhang Lu]]. Based on the advice of his advisors, Liu Bei betrayed Liu Zhang and seized the Yi Province from him, before declaring himself \"King of Hanzhong\" and setting up his headquarters in Chengdu. However soon after [[Guan Yu]] was killed by Liu Bei's \"ally\" Sun Quan who took the rest of Jing province. Liu Bei was furious and led his army against his former ally but was defeated by [[Lu Xun]]. Ashamed by his failure, he never returned to Chengdu and settled in Baidicheng where he died one year later. He urged his heir, [[Liu Shan]] not to emulate him and rather be as virtuous as possible. Before he died Liu Bei appointed Zhuge Liang to advise his son on domestic matters with Li Yan to advise him on the military matters. \r\n\r\nh4.

Later, she would have been part of the [[Operation Ten-Gou|Ten Go]]-style \"suicidal sortie\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_order_of_24_October_1918] of the German Navy's High Seas Fleet in late October 1918, but mutinies broke out that forced the cancellation of the sortie.

History\r\nIn real life, [i]Ryuujou[/i] was designed to exploit a loophole in the original Washington Naval Treaty that excluded carriers from total tonnage if they weighed 8,000 tons or less. To that end, she was given a slim cruiser hull, no armor, and a single hangar. However, the 1930 London Naval Treaty closed the loophole, while IJN planners insisted on doubling her air group so a second hangar was placed atop the original, leaving her as the only ship of her class and suffering from questionable seakeeping and stability. She was rebuilt after sustaining storm damage in 1935.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the war, she was the only carrier available to the IJN for Southeast Asian combat support operations (while the Kido Butai did provide support in the Dutch East Indies, they only did so when needed). Alongside [[Junyou (Azur Lane)|]], they participated in the Aleutians campaign before transferring to Guadalcanal. She was sunk by aircraft from [[Saratoga (Azur Lane)|]] in the battle of the Eastern Solomons in late August 1942.\r\n\r\nh4.

Each class has access to a personal selection of cards in addition to a general pool (which is counted as a ninth class not playable on its own). \r\n\r\nEach player can mulligan their starting hand to find better cards in case of a bad draw. The player who goes first gets 2 evolution points, and the player who goes second gets 3 evolution points. \r\n\r\nAt the start of their turn, each player draws one card from their deck and places it in their hand. The player who goes second draws two cards on the first turn. Cards in the deck can't be seen during battle.\r\n\r\nh4.

It's also an allusion to his sire's name.[/tn]\r\n\r\nReal Life Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse. Sired by [[Lord Kanaloa (racehorse)|]] and foaled by Miss Pemberley (this makes [[Montjeu (racehorse)|]] his damsire), he is famed for his extreme front-runner running style that is reminescent of both Twin Turbo and [[Silence Suzuka (racehorse)|]].\r\n\r\nHe is a bay horse with no markings. He is usually distinguished with his mane tufts and his red and white hood.\r\n\r\nDue to his running style and initial limited successes, he was nicknamed the \"Twin Turbo of the Reiwa era\". But then, starting in late 2021, he started winning bigger and bigger races and was particularly successful overseas, culminating with first G1 win at the 2022 Dubai Turf (albeit, a dead heat, sharing the prize with another horse) and then, despite being more of a turf horse, he won his second G1 win at the 2023 Saudi Cup, which happens to be the race with the largest purse ever held. With this feat, he became the first Japanese horse to have won G1 wins overseas on both turf and dirt as well as instantly catapulting him into second place of Japan's top earning racehorses, having more than doubled his earnings in that one race. Due to his successes overseas, he was rechristened \"Panthalassa of the world\", a nickname that mirrors his sire's own nickname.\r\n\r\nAnother race of note for Panthalassa was the 2022 Autumn Tenno-sho. The race saw the front-running horse lead the race by a wide margin, on top of the fact that he ran the race at the same time as Silence Suzuka's ill-fated run of the same race in 1998, even though the race concluded with [[Equinox (racehorse)|]] catching up to Panthalassa and winning the race by a horse length. \r\n\r\nIn the context of [i][[Umamusume]][/i], he is most often refered to in fanart in the context of fellow front-runners [[Twin Turbo (umamusume)|]] and [[Silence Suzuka (umamusume)|]] but also in light of [[Maeda Rena]] proclaiming she is Panthalassa's mother, leading to pictures where [[Grass Wonder (umamusume)|]] is treating a baffled horse girl Panthalassa as if she was her baby. Typically, a horse girl Panthalassa is portrayed with a [[ponytail]] or a hairstyle with multiple ponytails, white and red [[ear covers]], a marine-style costume or something that evokes Pangaea and an accessory on or around [b]her right ear[/b].\r\n\r\nh5.

There are many styles, but it typically is a long, form-fitting dress with a [[mandarin collar]], an asymmetric left-over-right opening, high-to-medium [[side slit]]s, and embellished with Chinese [[pankou|frog fasteners]] on the lapel and the collar.
