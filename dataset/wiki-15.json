It became extremely popular in several different countries. \r\n\r\nA second animated spin-off series called [[She-Ra Princess of Power|She-Ra: Princess of Power]] was released in 1985. It also became quite popular, but not as much as the first series. It was rebooted in 2018 as [[She-Ra and the Princesses of Power]].\r\n\r\nDesigner Roger Sweet claims to be the chief creator of He-Man and MOTU, although this is not officially acknowledged by Mattel and is disputed by some other contributors. The earliest storybooks and much of the original backstory were written by Donald F. Glut, while the final production sculpt of the very first 1982 He-Man [[action figure]] was done by Tony Guerrero.\r\n\r\nh4.Remastered original intro\r\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzNARHgDROw\r\n\r\nh4.Masters of the Universe characters \r\n* [[Teela]]\r\n* [[Man-At-Arms]]\r\n* [[Orko]]\r\n* [[Battle Cat (masters of the universe)|]]\r\n* [[King Randor]]\r\n* [[Marlena Glenn]]\r\n* [[Prince Adam]]\r\n* [[Ram Man]]\r\n* [[mossman_(he-man)|Mossman]]\r\n* [[sorceress_(he-man)|Sorceress]]\r\n* [[Man-E-Faces]]\r\n* [[stratos_(motu)|Stratos]]\r\n* [[Keldor]]\r\n* [[Evil-Lyn]]\r\n* [[Beast Man]]\r\n* [[Tri-Klops]]\r\n* [[Mer-Man]]\r\n* [[Trap-Jaw]]\r\n* [[Faker (he-man)|]]\r\n* [[Shokoti]]\r\n\r\nh4.Princess of Power characters\r\n* [[She-Ra]]\r\n* [[Adora (she-ra)|]]\r\n* [[Hordak]]\r\n* [[Catra]]\r\n* [[Mantenna]]\r\n* [[Shadow Weaver]]\r\n* [[Scorpia]]\r\n* [[leech_(she-ra)|Leech]]\r\n* [[Entrapta]]\r\n* [[Horde Trooper]]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[Castle Grayskull]]\r\n* [[Sword of Power]]\r\n* [[Sword of Protection]]\r\n* [[Fabulous Secret Powers (meme)|]]\r\n* \"Wikipedia article\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe\r\n* [i]\"Wiki Grayskull\":http://he-man.wikia.com/wiki/He-Man_Wiki [/i]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["He-Man","MOTU","マスターズ超空の覇者","マスターズ_超空の覇者","He-man","he-man","HE-MAN","themastersoftheuniverse","mastersoftheuniverse"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":254210,"created_at":"2025-08-12T21:05:48.405-04:00","updated_at":"2025-08-12T21:05:48.405-04:00","title":"tamamo_no_mae_(mikotto!_bride_training)_(fate)","body":"[[Tamamo no Mae (fate)|]] in her apron from the [b]Mikotto!
