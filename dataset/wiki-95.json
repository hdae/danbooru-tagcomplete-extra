This feature helps to distinguish Kamchatka lilies from [[lily (flower)|true lilies]] and [[tulip]]s. The leaves are lance-shaped.\r\n\r\nNote that its Japanese name, クロユリ (黒百合 [i]kuro-yuri[/i], lit. black lily), can be used for both fritillarias and black colored [[lily (flower)|lilies]] (genus Lilium).

Designed by [[Zol]]\r\nShe almost died drowning, though she survived, she is now effected by her own Ninja Art and is stuck near the sea.\r\nBecause of her appearance, physique, and the presence of an evil spirit possessing her, few people would want to get close to her, and she also has few friends and acquaintances because she doesn't want to cause trouble to others with her constitution. Regardless, she wishes to be close to others at times, which can allow her powers to go slightly out of control.

Her clothes tend to be very frilly and covered in flower motifs. She's from a wealthy upbringing.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Momoka is a mature girl who appears to have a lady-like aura about her. While she often tries to act older than she is, Momoka still is a young girl at heart and is susceptible to things girls her age enjoy. She was scouted by considering herself the prize in the Production Match Festival. She regularly holds tea parties with the younger idols, and takes them very seriously. Her favorite tea seems to be “Rose Hip Tea”, although she can occasionally be distracted from it via the antics of her guests.\r\n\r\nMomoka found a friend in [[Umeki Otoha]], as they both shared a similar demeanor. She appears to enjoy teasing [[Kamiya Nao]], as she notes Nao chooses her clothes and costumes with the Producer in mind. Momoka also really likes the glasses [[Kamijo Haruna]] gave her, and enjoys selecting kimonos with friends. She holds the Producer in very high regard and shows that she will put herself on the line in order to show him that she cares about him.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 8th CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Tachibana Arisu]], [[Ichinose Shiki]], [[Katagiri Sanae]], and [[Shiomi Syuko]].\r\n\r\nVoiced by [[Terui Haruka]].\r\n\r\nh4.
