However, due to poor production, it unexpectedly became popular online. After the 「例のアレ」meme into China, this material was discovered by【美男(BiliBili ID)】, named it【潮汕英豪传（Legend of Chaoshan Heroes）】, and tried to learn from Niconico's creative style to develop it into a subculture similar to 【Gachimuchi】or【Inm】. \r\n\r\n【潮汕英豪传】has developed for the second time since 2018. Many of the main authors are Chaoshan natives (including the organizer of Chaoshan Touhou Only), who can easily understand the video content across the dialect barrier. This helps the development of this meme has been closer to subculture rather than only be a otomad material, and can build a set of world views and stories based on the original video. Therefore, the【潮汕英豪传】 can be said to be one of the few 「例のアレ」memes from  China，Or it can be called Chinese style「例のアレ」memes\r\n\r\nThe company is located in Jieyang City, Guangdong Province, China. Most of the actors in the film use local language, this dialect is called Chaozhou dialect(潮州話/潮汕話). In Southeast Asia, British colonists often heard the language spoken by immigrant laborers from the Chaoshan region.

Its armaments include a modular [[gunpod]], [[laser]] cannons and several different types of [[missile]]s. It can be equipped with modular attachments such as [[reactive armor]] and external fuel/thruster packs.\r\n\r\nThanks to its FF-2001 thermonuclear engines it can fly in both an atmosphere and outer [[space]]. The VF-1 [[variable fighter]] can also transform into fighter, [[gerwalk]] and [[battroid]] (giant robot) modes.\r\n\r\nThere are several different variants of the fighter, called [[VF-1A]], [[VF-1J]], [[VF-1D]], [[VF-1S]], [[VF-1J Armored]], [[SDP-1 Stampede Valkyrie]], [[VE-1]], [[VT-1]], [[VT-1 Super]], [[VF-1 Super]] and [[VF-1 Strike]].\r\n\r\nIt first appeared in [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross]] (1982) where it was created by the [[U.N. Spacy]] to fight a race of humanoid alien [[giant]]s called [[Zentradi]]. It was eventually succeeded by the far more advanced [[VF-4]] [i]Lighting III[/i].\r\n\r\nIn [[real life]] the VF-1 was designed by [[Kawamori Shouji]] in the early [[1980s_(style)|80s]]. The design of the mecha's fighter mode is loosely based on the [[f-14_tomcat|F-14]] combat jet and its name is a tribute to the [[XB-70]], Kawamori's favorite aircraft.\r\n\r\nThis mecha was called the [b]VF-1 Veritech[/b] in the [[ROBOTECH]] American adaptation of Macross. In that continuity the mecha was developed from alien [i][[ZOR|Robotechnology]][/i] and the term VERITECH is an acronym which stands for [b]V[/b]ariable [b]E[/b]ngineering and [b]R[/b]obotics [b]I[/b]ntegration [b]TECH[/b]nology. \r\n\r\nh4.

Its task is to debug and maintain the virtual side of the city. Its secondary function is to seek out and disable illegal AR devices, software, and viruses, making it a menace to the characters of the series. Searchmaton can deploy up to four spherical drones to aid in its task. While Searchmaton can patrol the city streets freely, it is prohibited to enter private property such as houses, and other spaces such as temple grounds and schools, because they lie outside of the responsibility of Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration. The protagonists utilize this and other predictable aspects of Searchmaton's behavior to escape its grasp. Searchmaton, striking terror into the hearts of children, is ironically painted with a smiley face and punctuates its violent attacks with the cute catch phrase \"I'm Satchī!\" (僕サッチー boku Satchī?) which [[okonogi_yuuko|Yasako's]] father had a part in developing. [[harakawa_tamako|Tamako]] often hijacks Searchmatons for use as her personal digital henchmen. They are later replaced by the upgraded Searchmaton 2.0 in the form of cubes which have upgraded weapons and shielding, and can combine like the Q-chan to perform wide area re-formatting. Since the 2.0s are under government jurisdiction they can enter areas inaccessible to Satchī including shrines, and also private property when authorised.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)","is_locked":false,"other_names":["サッチー","サーチマトン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":118130,"created_at":"2020-11-07T16:42:20.650-05:00","updated_at":"2023-06-09T01:00:05.655-04:00","title":"mike_(drawingchisanne)","body":"[b][i]ミケ[/i][/b]\r\n\r\nA recurring character in [[chai (drawingchisanne)|]]'s artworks.
