He lives on top of a hill and must go to Wobbletown at the bottom of the hill to do errands. He shouts to Mrs. Crumb, the baker, \"I'D LIKE A LOAF OF BREAD!\" and he shouts to Mr. Bacon, the butcher, \"I'D LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT!\" Having just about had it with Mr. Noisy's noisiness, Mrs. Crumb and Mr. Bacon come up with a plan. Next day, when Mr. Noisy goes shopping at both their shops again, Mrs. Crumb and Mr. Bacon just pretend not to hear him. Next day, when Mr. Noisy tries again at both shops, he realizes that he has to be quiet if he's to get what he wants. He also learns not to clump his shoes, not to open and shut doors loudly, and he also learns to whisper.\r\n\r\nIn the 2008 TV series The Mr. Men Show, Mr. Noisy remains relatively the same in looks, though he is given a megaphone-styled bullhorn to emphasize his character trait. He lives next door to Mr. Quiet in a stereo-shaped house. Every time he walks his boots make loud stomping sounds like an elephant. The ironic thing would be that even though he tells people to keep quiet, he is the one making the noise (as proven in Books and Music).In the episode Travel Miss Magic accidently turned him into a giant, red, loud whale.In the US and UK Versions he is voiced by Richard Epcar and Rob Rackstraw.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["氏騒々しいです"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":67702,"created_at":"2015-08-15T03:17:59.496-04:00","updated_at":"2015-08-15T03:17:59.496-04:00","title":"the_mr._men_show","body":"The Mr. Men Show (sometimes simply called Mr. Men) is a British/American animated television series based on the original Mr. Men and Little Miss books created in the late 20th century by British author Roger Hargreaves and his son Adam Hargreaves.
