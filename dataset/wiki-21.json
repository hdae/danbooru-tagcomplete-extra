You can view a list of them \"here\":/users?commit=Search&search%5Blevel%5D=>=37.\r\n\r\nh4. How does the modqueue work?\r\n\r\nh6. In Short:\r\n1. A new post is uploaded by a user who is below [[help:users|contributor level]].\r\n2. The post is placed in the modqueue.\r\n3. Approvers review the post.\r\n4. If there are no approvals within 3 days, the post is deleted.\r\n5. If any approver approves the post, the approved post is now active and remains on Danbooru indefinitely.\r\n6. If the post is flagged by another user, go to Step 2.\r\n\r\nPosts which are in the Queue are distinguished by their blue border when browsing thumbnails. \r\n\r\nThe full Queue may be listed by using the search metatag [b]{{status:pending}}[/b]. Approvers may use [b]{{status:unmoderated}}[/b] outside of the modqueue interface to see the pending posts they haven't made a decision on.\r\n\r\nh6. Exceptions and Exemptions:\r\n\r\n\"All contributors and above\":/help/users can post directly to active status, bypassing the modqueue.

Help Us Keep Our Gallery Clean!\r\n\r\nIf you find a particularly low quality post that doesn't belong on Danbooru, you may [[howto:flag|flag]] the post to have it return to the modqueue for a second check.\r\n\r\nSimply open the post in full view, and click on [b]Flag[/b] on the left pane, third choice from the top under [b]Options[/b]. You will be prompted to enter your reason for returning the post to the Queue. Click on OK, and the image's approval will be reconsidered.\r\n\r\nh4. What should I do about my deleted Posts?\r\n\r\nMost of the time, it is safe to assume that every post in the Queue has been reviewed at least once.\r\n\r\nIf an upload isn't approved after three days, it is mostly because it doesn't meet our quality standards. It is comparatively rare for a high-quality post to end up getting deleted because the Queue missed it.\r\n\r\nWith the understanding that the manual and subjective process of the modqueue has its inherent flaws, post deletions may be appealed.

However, unlike [[Kantai Collection]], where most of the ships originally came from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], Warship Girls R from the start featured ships from various naval forces around the world. \r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe game was initially released by \"Suzhou Paiqu Network Technology\":[http://www.p7game.com/], as Warship Girls, for Android and iOS devices in September, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn July 2015 there was a split between the publisher of the game and its developer, MoeFantasy (幻萌), and from then on each company developed and released its own version of the game, which differed in available characters, interface design, etc.\r\n\r\nOn August 29th 2015 at ComiCon16, Shanghai, MoeFantasy revealed via trailer the development of [i]Project R[/i], a major overhaul of the game including new features, updated UI and a new animated combat system. This version was released in November the same year as client version 2.0 and was dubbed 战舰少女R (Warship Girls R). The MoeFantasy version would become the main focus of all community efforts, from wikis to drop data libraries and fan works.\r\n\r\nOn June 23rd 2016, it was announced on the community's Baidu forum and later as official statements that a settlement had been reached between the two companies. SPNT shut down its servers on September in the same year.\r\n\r\nOn October 24th 2017, a Japanese translated version and server released under the name 戦艦少女R, or Senkan Shoujo R.\r\n\r\nOn December 18th 2018, a Global server and Korean server were officially released.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2018, on September 8th, a spinoff was released that was made by MoeFantasy's Japanese branch, entitled 蒼青のミラージュ or [[steelblue mirage|MiST: The Mirage of Steelblue]]. Due to various reasons, it became unavailable on March 15th, 2020, with refunds beginning at the same time, ending on June 15th.\r\n\r\nThe Global server and Korean server were shut down on the 31st of August, 2021.\r\n\r\nh4.

The word jūji is also found in \"jūjika\" (十字架), meaning a cross.\r\n \r\nIn general, the practitioner secures an arm at the wrist of the opponent, trapping it by squeezing the knees together. The attacker's legs end up across the opponent's chest, with the arm held between the thighs, with the elbow pointing against the thigh or hips. By holding the opponent's wrist to the attacker's chest with the pinky finger on the sternum and the thumb facing up (arm semi-supinated or semi-pronated), the practitioner can easily extend the opponent's arm and hyperextend the opponent's elbow. The attacker can further increase the pressure on the elbow joint by arching their hips against the elbow.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n* [[judo]]\r\n* [[martial arts]]\r\n\r\nh4.
