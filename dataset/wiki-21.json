Haruka becomes acquainted with six of her classmates, who are all competing to become idols. For her project, she must team up with another student as an idol-producer team, and if they are successful, they will join Shining Agency after graduation.  \r\n\r\nThe franchise features three idol groups: the main group [[STARISH|ST★RISH]], [[QUARTET NIGHT]] - a band made up of the seniors of ST★RISH in the 2013 game [i]Uta no Prince-sama: All Star[/i], and HE★VENS - an anime-only idol group introduced in [[uta no prince-sama maji love 2000%|Uta no Prince-sama: Maji Love 2000%]] and not seen before in the games who become rivals to ST★RISH\r\n\r\nh4.

Using this technology, humanity began migrating to Mars and settling there. After settlers discovered additional advanced technology, the Vers Empire was founded, which claimed Mars and its secrets for themselves. Later, the Vers Empire declared war on Earth, and in 1999, a battle on the Moon's surface caused the hypergate to explode, shattering the Moon and scattering remnants into a debris belt around the planet. Cut off from Mars, the remnants of the Vers Empire established several massive orbital space stations within the debris belt and a ceasefire was established. 15 years later, in 2014, an attack on the Vers princess during a peace mission causes the Empire to launch a new attack on Earth, this time determined to conquer it once and for all.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her skirt is now unambiguously a shortened [[hakama]], her left [[tasuki]] loses its prominent bow, her sleeves gain ribbon trimming, and her [[thighhighs]] are replaced by [[tabi]] with black thighhigh gaiters. Her gear is built up from base with (at Kai Ni) two extra [[quiver|quivers]] on her hips, a black [[flight deck]], a black [[yumi (bow)|yumi]], and more modern AA guns (long 10cm guns). \r\n\r\nIn her Kai Ni E remodel, she is dimly lit for night operations, reflecting her new ability to fight in night battles, and her eyes gain a slight glow (although this can be attributed to how the iris interacts with light). Compared to her Kai Ni gear, she replaces her AA gun and her left quiver for a [[sword]]. \r\n\r\nThese remodels are essentially hypotheticals, reflecting what she could have been if she hadn't been sunk at Midway. There were plans to modernize Akagi after Midway that would have remedied aiming and firing radius problems with her 120 mm twin mounts by moving them one deck up for cross-deck fire, and ultimately replacing these 120 mm with newer 127 mm dual purpose twin mounts.\r\n\r\nh4.

In August 2016, [i]Princess Connect! Re:Dive[/i] was announced as a remake of the original game and advertised as an Anime RPG.\r\n\r\nIn February 2018, the game was officially released for Android and iOS. The remake is notable for using an anime-style format to tell its story complete with an \"opening song\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8uuBB7SoM], \"cutscenes\":[https://youtu.be/xCX1Qx40sUM?t=447], \"ending credits\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XXC4TSTuxU], and even a next \"episode preview\":[https://youtu.be/xCX1Qx40sUM?t=739]. Wit Studio is credited for the anime portions of the game. A global version was released on January 19, 2021, and later \"ended\":[https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2023/3/30/an-important-update-regarding-princess-connect-re-dive] on April 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay in the remake is heavily reliant on team composition to progress through the more difficult portions of the game and encourages raising multiple characters to complete certain challenges. Despite differing initial rarities, all characters can be raised to the maximum rarity which unlocks their full stories and maximum potential.\r\n\r\nIn the original story, the game was set in \"Legend of Astrum\", an MMO where the player would meet various girls and recruit them. Because of the MMO setting, each girl had a fantasy version and a real-life version. The story in the remake plays out as a sequel, starting the narrative with a \"Bad End\" to the original series in which the characters remain in the MMO, unaware of there ever being a separate real world.\r\n\r\nh4.

She has a loving infatuation with - and at least as of [[Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves]], is engaged to - fellow Shiranui-ryuu practitioner [[Andy Bogard]], whom she trained with at a relatively young age and she came to see as a good man (though she tended to move the relationship a little too quickly for Andy's liking).

The manga was first published in 1982 on [[Weekly Shounen Jump]].\r\n\r\nThe original anime adaptation created by [[Toei Company]] in 1984 sparked a massive controversy due to the anime featured massive amount of violence (especially for its time when \"Adult content air time\" did not exist), most notably gore. leading to massive usage of censorship on the anime, and the creation of \"Adult content air time\", a slot of airing time on Television specifically for violent anime.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the series' extreme violence and masculine-heavy theme had later inspired other action shounen and seinen manga and anime, particularly during late 80s and 90s era.

Story (anime adaptation)\r\n\r\nNear the end of the 20th century, a nuclear war engulfed most of the Earth's surface, reducing most of the world into a vast desert wasteland. The survivors of mankind banded together in tribes in order to fight over the few supply of uncontaminated food and water still left in the world, with the strong often preying on the weak. [[Kenshiro]], the successor of the assassination art known as Hokuto Shinken, wanders the wasteland after being separated from his fiancee [[Yuria (Hokuto no Ken)|]] by his friend-turned-enemy [[Shin_(hokuto_no_ken)|Shin]]. Accompanied by two young children, [[Bat (Hokuto no Ken)|]] and [[Lin (hokuto no ken)|]], Ken becomes a savior to the weak and innocent from the various gangs and ruthless bandits threatening their survival. Throughout the course of his journey, Kenshiro encounters various formidable rivals and adversaries, ultimately culminating with Kenshiro's eldest adoptive brother [[Raoh (hokuto no ken)|]], an oppressive tyrant who challenges Ken for the right of the Hokuto Shinken succession.\r\n\r\nSeveral years afterward, Kenshiro reunites with the now grown Bat and Lynn in order to stand up against a corrupt Imperial Army. The three, with the help of other rebels, manage to expose a conspiracy within the Imperial Army to keep the Heavenly Empress ([spoiler]Lynn's estranged twin sister, Lui[/spoiler]) imprisoned. The Empress is saved, only for Lynn to be taken to the \"Land of Asura\", a country of warriors where only the mightiest survive. Kenshiro crosses to Asura in pursuit of her, only to find himself fighting against the three generals who rule over the land.

The Saints have sworn to defend the reincarnation of the benevolent Greek goddess [[Athena (saint seiya)|]] in her battle against other evil Olympian and Norse mythology gods who want to dominate Earth.\r\n\r\nThe manga was adapted into an anime television series by [[Toei Company]] with character designs and art by [[Araki Shingo]] that ran from 1986 to 1989, before being continued in the form of three original video animation series between 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\nFour animated feature films were shown in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989, with a fifth in 2004 and a sixth in 2014. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, creator Kurumada published a sequel manga titled [[Saint Seiya: Next Dimension]]. Several spin-off manga by different authors have also been created, as well as a standalone anime and original net animation.\r\n\r\nSaint Seiya has been very successful, with over 34 million copies sold in Japan alone. The series began to be known in the west after it became popular in France in 1988, where it was given the French name of [i]Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque[/i]; this was also the first foreign release of the series. Since the early 90s the series also became very popular in Spanish-speaking countries after it was released in Spain as \"Los Caballeros del Zodiaco\". \r\n\r\nBecause of its popularity many RPG, action and fighting video games based on the series have been released in the last decades.\r\n\r\nh4.
