Black hair, dark eyes (highlight color depends on the ambient light). \r\nAn extremely happy-go-lucky, carefree personality, optimistic. \r\nBeing gentlemanly, she can't leave troubled girls alone; a gentlewoman who wants to make them happy. A lady-killer. \r\nA bit theatrical/dramatic, she is the type of person to use smug pick-up lines without hesitation. \r\n\r\n\"I can't leave a troubled girl alone, can I?\" \r\n\r\nWith both a manly mind and body, there's hardly any traces of femininity in her. There are lots of cases where people mistake her gender upon first meeting her (generally they are able to tell by her huge boobs). \r\nSince she herself is also not very aware of her gender, she feels uncomfortable when people treat her like a girl. \r\n\r\nWithout being concerned with particulars, she makes passes at any girl that catches her eye and goes out with them one after the other. \r\nThe tone of her voice is androgynous. \r\n\r\n\"C'mon, it's fine isn't it, if you become mine, just for a little bit\" \r\n[tn]Tweaked it to make it sound a little more natural, feel free to re-tweak.[/tn]\r\n\r\nShe fell in love with first sight when she met [[sekai_(karakuri_shoujo)|Sekai]]. At first, she had a hard time with Sekai being unable to read between the lines. Once she is able to convey her thoughts to her, they become clingy love birds. \r\n(Nevertheless, her wavering towards other girls doesn't diminish)\r\n\r\nSince she's handsome, she's popular.\r\nBecause she's well-aware of her own superiority, there is a part of her that is narcissistic and self-centered.\r\nThere isn't really anything she's fussed about being the best at in particular, but she's the type that wants to be superior at something or other. \r\n\r\nHaving nerves of steel, no matter what, she is impressed with everything. Without thinking of the consequences, she's a go-getter that relentlessly butts into things. She is the type that will die quickly. \r\n\r\nDespite being a human, she is invulnerable. Even with wounds or on the verge of death, she has a physical constitution that heals her on the spot without leaving any wounds.\r\nHer sense of pain is generally about average, so though she does heal herself, she openly dislikes being wounded. \r\n\"I thought I was gonna die\" is her catchphrase. In reality, she did. \r\n\r\nAccording to [[lilian_(karakuri_shoujo)|Lilian]] — she is a human who loves Sekai. (She also says she's got some hefty \"plot armor\":http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor)\r\nBecause of that, she is rough about everything and no matter what happens, thinks she'll \"be able to manage somehow or another\". \r\n\r\nShe is aware of her pushiness due to her selfish greed, and deprecates herself saying \"I'm not a good person in the least\". \r\nRegarding her relationships with women, bluntly put, she's trash. \r\n\r\n[spoiler]\r\nShe is the reincarnation of \"Sora\":https://www.uchinokomato.me/chara/show/12786. Her constitution is the result of a \"curse\" in her past life.\r\nAs a human who has cut off her negative mindset, it's as though there is no such thing as \"despair\". \r\nA person who would enjoy themselves up till they die.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nShe likes girls, Sekai, and wide open places where you can look out at the sky. \r\nHer dislikes/weaknesses are complicated things, things she's worried about, and formal, ceremonious things.

He retained most of his characteristics but was given a different name so that trolls wouldn't find him.
