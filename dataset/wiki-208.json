Without any base in the anime, this Houki parody came out to mock and laugh at other anime for selling poorer than I.S. (or as likely, going to sell poorer than I.S.) or just laugh at this and that (like sales trend or related manga/novel sales), but when she was proven wrong, then she would smilingly declared that she knew all along the other anime will do well or that she is in fact a fan all along. Now its use is so ubiquitous that you see her in book stores, game centers, video rental stores etc to make sales speech over this or that.

Among the folktales in which the short, demon-like humanoid called [[amanojaku_(creature)|Amanojaku]] appears, this story is the only type which is widely recounted throughout Japan.\r\n\r\nIn a basic summary of the story, a baby born from a melon is carefully raised by an old couple, and she grows up to be a beautiful young woman skilled at weaving. While her adoptive parents are away from their home, Amanojaku tricks and kidnaps her. The demon impersonates Uriko-hime, but while the impostor is going to a wealthy man's home to marry him, the fake Uriko-hime is accused by the cawing of a crow, and reveals her true identity, whereupon his true form is revealed, and the old couple and accompanying villagers beat him to death (or alternatively, he runs away).\r\n\r\nThis folktale is known for the countless variations on the story depending on the region. In southwestern Japan, her clothes are stolen and she is tied up to a tree, but in many cases she escapes unharmed and lives happily in the end. In northwestern Japan, in many versions the poor young woman is tricked to climb a persimmon tree from which she falls to her death. Amanojaku flays her skin and impersonates her by wearing it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tale, it is often accompanied by an explanation that the place where Amanojaku was killed was a field of buckwheat, and that is why buckwheat stalks are red.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Wikipedia: \"Amanojaku\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanojaku \r\n* Wikipedia (JP): \"うりこひめとあまのじゃく\":https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%86%E3%82%8A%E3%81%93%E3%81%B2%E3%82%81%E3%81%A8%E3%81%82%E3%81%BE%E3%81%AE%E3%81%98%E3%82%83%E3%81%8F ","is_locked":false,"other_names":["瓜子姫"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":56231,"created_at":"2014-07-13T05:58:57.495-04:00","updated_at":"2014-07-13T05:58:57.495-04:00","title":"shiori_(ssb)","body":"The name you wanted to search is probably a certain banned artist  who was tagged as [[shiori_(artist)]] on danbooru.\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":45653,"created_at":"2013-05-19T06:43:02.669-04:00","updated_at":"2014-07-13T05:20:42.930-04:00","title":"wakamiya_shinobu","body":"若宮 詩暢\r\nA character in [[Chihayafuru]].
