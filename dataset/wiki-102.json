Additionally, Kio Shimoku announced in the manga that a new TV anime adaptation of the [i]Second Generation[/i] manga was in the works with the title [i]Genshiken Nidaime[/i] (げんしけん 二代目 - [i]Genshiken Second Generation[/i]), later airing in Japan from July 6 to September 29, 2013.\r\n\r\nA [i]Genshiken Second Season OAD[/i] or Original Animation DVD was bundled with the limited edition of the 15th volume of the Genshiken manga.

Frequently, she can be made to appear thuggish instead of smirking.  Plasma-chan is also a highly violent \"dark-side\" version of Inazuma, usually threatening people (or eggplants) with weapons or martial arts (see post #1726517). Alternately, simply behaving in a manner deliberately the opposite of the \"pure and innocent\" normal Inazuma (see post #1703511).\r\n\r\nPlasma-chan was, in the Twitter images that originated her meme, violently opposed to an artist named [[Nasu (tenpurakkusu)|]] (Japanese for \"[[eggplant]]\") and featured the [[solid circle eyes]] and [[diamond mouth]] face as her salient traits in the series.  Some references to Plasma-chan just have her head and a \"nasu\" speech bubble. \r\n\r\nInazuma's name means \"lightning\" in Japanese, so she becomes \"plasma\" as her dark side. \r\n\r\nInazuma's catchphrase \"[[nanodesu_(phrase)|]]\" (なのです) may be [i]just slightly[/i] altered into \"な゛の゛て゛す!
