This game features the characters as mostly SD chibis and is not graphic like the other games are.\r\n\r\n[i]Splatterhouse Remake[/i] (not official title), was released on November 23rd of 2010 for Western markets and is a 3D third person remake of the first game.\r\n\r\nIn the games, the player controls [[rick_(splatterhouse)|Rick Taylor]], a man who has, through his fusion with an Evil Mask, become extremely strong and who resembles to a great degree [[Jason Voorhees]], of the [[Friday the 13th]] movies.\r\n\r\nThe games take place in a variety of locations, but all have a common setting, in and around a frightening mansion filled with disgusting demons and monsters.\r\n\r\nThe point of the games, with the exception of part 3, is to save Rick's girlfriend, [[Jennifer (Splatterhouse)|]], who has been targeted for one reason or another by the various demons and evil forces that inhabit the game's localities. \r\n\r\nIn part 3 the player must use the map to find and save both Jennifer and their child from the demons, so it differs from the other games, which are mostly 2d side scrolling. Part 3 differs also because time limits are in place for the family saving mission portions of the game. Part 3 also differs in that Rick can 'power up' himself for a brief time to use vastly increased physical power to do drastic damage, as well as using some special moves. Finally, part 3 differs because enemies can be grabbed and slammed, headbutted, etc.\r\n\r\nRick can punch, kick, jump, equip various melee weapons, and perform a sliding kick. In most instances, his strength is evidenced by the brutal mutilation of the enemies due to the hitting power of his attacks. For example, zombie like enemies burst in half when struck. In part 2 and 3, it is revealed that the mask which granted him this power has an infernal, evil personality.\r\n\r\nWeapons include: 2x4, Lead Pipe, Explosive Potion, Cleaver, Shotgun, Rock, and others.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested by the storyline of the first two games that the monsters have come about due to an unholy mix of science and magic and that the mask is a conduit of some ancient, hellish force that is not specifically named but that has much to do, albeit in the background, with the monsters and demons being there in the first place.\r\n\r\nPlay-through videos are avaliable at www.youtube.com.\r\n\r\nSources: Wikipedia pages.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スプラッターハウス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":173617,"created_at":"2023-09-30T03:40:47.663-04:00","updated_at":"2023-09-30T03:40:47.663-04:00","title":"yarofes:2023","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["野郎フェス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":141332,"created_at":"2022-04-08T16:30:43.647-04:00","updated_at":"2023-09-30T03:18:00.737-04:00","title":"paripi_koumei","body":"An ongoing 2019-to-present manga series written by [b]Yotsuba Yuuto[/b] with art by [[Ogawa Ryou]].

However, due to the advanced state of her construction as a battleship before conversion, [i]Shinano[/i] has a dispropotionally small hangar size of 47 aircrafts (in comparison, the light aircraft carrier [[Ryuujou (kancolle)|]] accommodated 48 aircrafts despite her displacement is almost 7 times less than that of Shinano's). Due to this, the IJN planned to use [i]Shinano[/i] as a support carrier to tend the other fleet carrier's air wings.\r\n\r\n[i]Shinano[/i] was launched October 8, 1944 (originally planned to launced May 1945, but her construction was expedited due to the \"Battle of the Philippine Sea\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea)]) and commissioned November 19, 1944. [i]Shinano[/i] was dispatched from Yokosuka to Kure with an inexperienced crew to finish her fitting out and embark her aircraft, but she was sunk en-route by  \"[i]USS Archerfish[/i]\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Archerfish_%28SS-311%29 on November 29, 1944.

He directed the anime film [[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]] in 1984, when he was only 24 years old.\r\n\r\nKawamori attended Keio University in the same years as Macross screenwriter Ōnogi Hiroshi and character designer [[Mikimoto Haruhiko]] (where they had a [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] fanclub called \"Gunsight-1\"). He occasionally used the alias 黒河影次 Kurokawa Eiji early in his career when he started as a member of Studio Nue. \r\n\r\nKawamori Shouji is also an accomplished visual artist and [[mecha]] designer. Some of his early anime works include designs for [[Techno Police 21C]], [[Ulysses 31]] and [[Crusher Joe]]. He may be best known as the designer of the legendary [[VF-1]] [b]Valkyrie[/b] from [[MACROSS]] and the original [b]Convoy[/b] ([[Optimus Prime]]) toy for [[Transformers]]. \r\n\r\nEach and every variable fighter from the Macross series (except those from [[Macross 2]]) was created by him. \r\n\r\nThese and other designs have established Kawamori as a (perhaps the) master of transforming mecha. He’s also known for designing the [[Gundam GP-01 Zephyranthes]] and the [[Gundam GP-02 Physalis]] from [[Gundam 0083]]. Kawamori has also created designs for videogames like [[Choukou Senki Kikaiou]] ([[Rafaga]]) and the [[Armored Core]] series. He still works with Studio Nue on certain projects. The majority of his designs are sleek and aerodynamic although he’s quite versatile – many people have trouble identifying Kawamori designs. He is sought after as a mecha designer and has worked on a large variety of projects and continues to produce and direct anime TV series and OVA’s.\r\n\r\nKawamori is currently executive director at the animation studio Satelight. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, ecological concern... and lots of music idols. \r\n\r\nh4.
