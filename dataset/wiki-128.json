It is also often interpreted as \"The Supreme Commander of Youkai\". In old literature, this name was only one of the common names for the mysterious slimy monsters.  In some old folklore stories,  a slippery sphere that appears in the sea was called Nurarihyon.\r\n\r\nFor unknown reasons, in the 18th century, this creature came to be portrayed as an old man with a large bald head like a gourd, wearing a kimono or monk's stole. \"Toriyama Sekien\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toriyama_Sekien drew a picture of this youkai in his 1776 book [[Gazu Hyakki Yagyou]], and the folklorist \"Fujisawa Morihiko\":[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E6%B2%A2%E8%A1%9B%E5%BD%A6] introduced it in his book published in 1929-30 by adding unsourced commentary to it: まだ宵の口の燈影にぬらりひよんと訪問する怪物の親玉 (\"The boss of monsters unexpectedly slips into someone's house, being illuminated with a lamplight in the early evening.\") A variety of people such as manga artists, novelists, and occult writers expanded the interpretations of this short paragraph by adding almost random commentary. [[Mizuki Shigeru]] integrated these commentaries and circulated it in his manga and anime, and thus the current Nurarihyon was born.\r\n\r\nNurarihyon in present times is explained in the following manner: He enters one's house from nowhere during the evening, and behaves like it's his own home drinking tea and tobacco. Because people do not notice him since they are too busy, or mistakenly think that he is the landlord, they cannot expel it. \r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia article\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurarihyon\r\n* \"Zack Davisson's blog: ”Nurarihyon – The Slippery Gourd”\":http://hyakumonogatari.com/2014/11/17/nurarihyon-the-slippery-gourd/\r\n\r\n* [[Nurarihyon (gegege no kitarou)|]] ([[Gegege no Kitarou]])\r\n* [[Nurarihyon (nurarihyon no mago)|]] ([[Nura Rikuo]]'s grandfather) ([[Nurarihyon no Mago]])\r\n* [[Nurarihyon (gantz)|]] ([[GANTZ]])\r\n* [[Nurarihyon (youkai watch)|]] ([[Youkai Watch]])\r\n* [[Nurarihyon (monster girl encyclopedia)|]] ([[Monster Girl Encyclopedia]])\r\n\r\n* [[Tag Group:Legendary Creatures]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ぬらりひょん"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149519,"created_at":"2022-08-31T12:29:02.655-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:29:14.826-04:00","title":"amadeus_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アマデウス","アマデウス(アリスフィクション)","Amadeus"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149518,"created_at":"2022-08-31T12:26:27.011-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:26:27.011-04:00","title":"agent_ace_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エージェント・エース","에이전트_에이스","에이전트에이스","Agent_Ace","AgentAce"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149517,"created_at":"2022-08-31T12:23:06.584-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:23:06.584-04:00","title":"andromeda_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アンドロメダ","안드로메다","Andromeda"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149515,"created_at":"2022-08-31T12:02:41.606-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:02:41.606-04:00","title":"andersen_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アンデルセン","안데르센","Andersen"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149514,"created_at":"2022-08-31T12:01:50.295-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:01:50.295-04:00","title":"minato_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ミナト","미나토","Minato"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149513,"created_at":"2022-08-31T12:00:56.343-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:00:56.343-04:00","title":"???_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["???"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":148931,"created_at":"2022-08-22T12:16:58.119-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T12:00:35.501-04:00","title":"neu_(alice_fiction)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ネウ","네우","Neu"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149509,"created_at":"2022-08-31T11:46:20.264-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-31T11:57:23.267-04:00","title":"alice_fiction","body":"A puzzle RPG game created by WonderPlanet. \r\n\r\nh4.

There just wasn't any available time for her.\r\n\r\nLoraine finally decided to go on vacation she'd been putting off for years, and she built an amusement android that only existed in a blueprint for the first time. That's how a specialized android AA72, different from the MK series tasked with battle or housework came to be. Loraine was so touched from how the AA series would actively search out tasks. She ordered a specially made swimsuit from Kamazon for it to wear.\r\n\r\nWhen AA72 disappeared on the beach, Loraine lost her usual composure and became quite flustered. An android running away was unprecedented. On top of that, a cooling device, which was AA72's major component, had gotten loose. She immediately sent androids to search the beach, and even asked for help from the lifeguard. Loraine didn't expect the lifeguard would run away with AA72.\r\n\r\nAfter she returned to Heavenhold from vacation, Loraine first established a duty hand-off procedure for androids. Various improvements in different fields, such as enhanced hand-off procedures, additional monitoring systems, and duty confirmation systems were added to prevent similar incidents from occuring. Some androids complained about how their vacation made more troublesome tasks, but all of them fell silent after they had a meeting with Loraine.\r\n\r\nThis year's 'Summer Focus' picked Loraine as ’The top hottest trending woman'. Sohee caused a scene asking why she wasn't picked for 1st place while Loraine said such rankings are meaningless.

The Focus special article about Loraine is preciously placed within the album.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["夏の旅館の主ロレイン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":141177,"created_at":"2022-04-05T21:51:23.748-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-26T22:58:32.610-04:00","title":"exorcist_miya","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ミヤ(ガーディアンテイルズ)","冬の恋人ミヤ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":149170,"created_at":"2022-08-26T22:47:55.194-04:00","updated_at":"2022-08-26T22:48:41.394-04:00","title":"canaan_(yong_jie_wujian)","body":"Wiki: https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BF%A6%E5%8D%97/57491859","is_locked":false,"other_names":["迦南"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":41693,"created_at":"2013-01-15T13:42:07.267-05:00","updated_at":"2022-08-26T22:39:25.058-04:00","title":"hanna_rudel","body":"Hanna U.
