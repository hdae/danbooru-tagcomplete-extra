Haruka becomes acquainted with six of her classmates, who are all competing to become idols. For her project, she must team up with another student as an idol-producer team, and if they are successful, they will join Shining Agency after graduation.  \r\n\r\nThe franchise features three idol groups: the main group [[STARISH|ST★RISH]], [[QUARTET NIGHT]] - a band made up of the seniors of ST★RISH in the 2013 game [i]Uta no Prince-sama: All Star[/i], and HE★VENS - an anime-only idol group introduced in [[uta_no_prince-sama_maji_love_2000_percent|Uta no Prince-sama: Maji Love 2000%]] and not seen before in the games who become rivals to ST★RISH\r\n\r\nh4.

The player is able to collect Pokémon to form a personalized team, train them to make them stronger, choose their known skills and command them to fight against other Pokémon. People who do that are Pokémon Trainers. Many NPCs are Pokémon Trainers available to fight against the player.\r\n\r\nThe storyline advances as the player gains eight [[gym_leader_badge|badges]] for defeating different Gym Leaders and eventually challenges the Elite Four and the current Champion; defeating them all grants the player the title of Champion for himself/herself. Typical side quests, such as finding a specific item or person, are also required at certain points.

to the \"Stand\" powers in [[JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken]], which typically are portrayed as ghost-like projections of a person's psyche or fighting spirit. The special powers vary widely, such as the ability to [[the fool (stand)|control sand]] or summon a [[silver chariot|sword-wielding warrior]]. They first appear in Part 3 of the manga, with the powers becoming increasingly more complex and abstract as the series goes on.\r\n\r\nIn Part 3 the first group of Stands are named after the Major Arcana of [[tarot|Tarot cards]] (such as [[Star Platinum]] and [[Hierophant Green]]). As the story continues the new enemy Stands are named after Egyptian gods (such as [[Anubis (stand)|]] and [[Horus (stand)|]]). Near the end some Stands are named after western music groups (such as [[Cream (stand)|]]).\r\n\r\nFrom Part 4 onwards, the vast majority of the Stands' names are named after various western music groups, albums, and songs (such as [[Killer Queen]], [[Aerosmith (stand)|]], [[Foo Fighters (jojo)|]], and [[20th Century Boy (Stand)|]]).\r\n\r\nAlthough usually featured with their \"Stand User\", it is not uncommon for Stands to be featured by themselves or with other people in fanart. An increasingly common example is [[Dio Brando]]'s Stand [[The World]], which is often featured with [[Touhou]]'s [[Izayoi Sakuya]].\r\n\r\nh4. List of tagged Stands\r\n\r\n\r\nh5.

This second arm can be either 'open' or clenched closed, and is usually also holding another object: generally a test tube, flask, ray gun, wrench, or some other 'sciencey' implement.\r\n\r\nh4.

After being assigned to several bombardment mission in late 1943, she took part in the \"Battle of Surigao Strait\":/pools/9549 before sent back to the United States in late 1944 for her first overhaul. After completion, she was sent to cover fire support at [[Iwo Jima]] before being struck by a kamikaze attack on 13 May 1945, forcing her to return to the US and receive her second overhaul. After the war, she has been converted two times, first in 1950 as an escort destroyer, before being converted back into a destroyer in 1962.  On 6 Febuary 1968, [i]Bache[/i] was stuck by a gale during her visit on the Isle of Rhodes, Greece, and ran aground. Ironically for the in-game emphasis on her character, the US Navy deemed her unrecoverable and she was sold for scrap there.\r\n\r\nh4.

Known as the NX during development. The first production model went on sale on March 3rd, 2017. \r\n\r\nThe Nintendo Switch has two dedicated [[game controller]]s (one for each hand) called [[Joy-Con]]s. These can be attached to and removed from the console at will, essentially making it a hybrid home/handheld platform.\r\n\r\nA smaller version, the [[nintendo switch lite|Switch Lite]], was revealed July 10th, 2019, built strictly for handheld gaming. The Lite has no detachable Joy-Cons; the controllers are hard-built into the console. It also has no HDMI output so cannot be connected to a TV like the original model Switch can. A [[nintendo switch - oled model|higher-end version]] featuring an OLED screen was released on October 8, 2021. \r\n\r\nThe platform has enjoyed a positive reception and high sales numbers in the years since its release. In addition to carrying many popular flagship titles like [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]] and [[Super Mario Odyssey]], the Switch has also become a welcoming home for many older games from last-gen systems. This led the Switch to be the [i]de facto[/i] portable way to play popular older titles like [[Diablo 3]], [[Dark Souls I]] and [[Castle Crashers]] which had previously only been playable on non-portable platforms. As of early 2023, the combined Switch product line is one of the best-selling platforms in Nintendo's entire history, outselling both the [[Wii]] and the [[Game Boy]] and now second only to the [[Nintendo DS]].\r\n\r\nFor tagging purposes, if the Switch has its Joy-Cons detached (or is being controlled by other compatible controllers), tag it as a [[game console]] (post #3259420, post #3528468). If the Switch has at least one Joy-Con connected or the console itself is the Lite, tag it as a [[handheld game console]] (post #3471232, post #3470179).\r\n\r\nh4.

Originally formed in 2022 as the Kastus Kalinouski Battalion, it was later expanded into a regiment due to an influx of volunteers. Named after [[Kastus Kalinouski]], a 19th-century Belarusian revolutionary, the unit consists of Belarusians opposing the pro-Russian regime of [[Alexander Lukashenko]] and supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression.\r\n\r\nThe regiment operates as part of [[Ukrainian_Ground_Forces|Ukraine’s Armed Forces]] and has participated in multiple engagements against Russian forces. While it is primarily a military unit, it also represents a broader anti-Lukashenko resistance movement, advocating for a democratic Belarus free from Russian influence.\r\n\r\nSince its formation, the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment has been a target of Russian and Belarusian state propaganda, which portrays it as a terrorist organization and an instrument of Western influence. Despite this, the regiment remains a key symbol of Belarusian opposition to authoritarian rule and continues to attract volunteers.\r\n\r\nh4.

It has since played a pivotal role in intense combat operations, including the defense of Bakhmut and the liberation of areas like Kherson and Andriivka.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch like its predecessor, the Azov Regiment, the 3rd Assault Brigade has faced scrutiny for its historical ties to far-right ideologies and the use of symbols such as the [[Wolfsangel]] in its early days, sparking controversy over alleged neo-Nazi associations. Critics point to its origins within the broader Azov movement, while supporters argue it has evolved into a professional fighting force, distancing itself from extremist roots as it merged with the Ground Forces. Russian propaganda continues to amplify these criticisms, portraying the brigade as a symbol of extremism to justify its actions in the conflict.

However, some experts argue that the regiment has evolved beyond its origins as street militia, tempering its neo-Nazi underpinnings as it became part of the Ukranian National Guard. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, criticism of the Azov Regiment has been a recurring theme of Russian politics and more recently as [[Vladimir Putin]]'s justification for invading Ukraine, the prominence of the unit in Ukraine's military forces being expanded and exaggerated by Russian media to this day.\r\n\r\nThe most recent official Azov Regiment logo now only uses a heavily altered Wolfsangel symbol, while the SSO (special forces) units don't use it at all (they use a [[tryzub]] formed out of swords instead).\r\n\r\nh4.
