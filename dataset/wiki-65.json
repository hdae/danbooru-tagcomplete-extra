Regardless, she wishes to be close to others at times, which can allow her powers to go slightly out of control.

It serves as a symbol of the country's unity, independence, and democratic ideals. \r\n\r\nThe design of the American flag consists of 13 horizontal stripes alternating between red and white, representing the original 13 colonies that declared independence from [[united_kingdom|British]] rule. In the top left corner, commonly referred to as the canton, there is a blue rectangle containing 50 white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine rows. These stars represent the 50 states of the United States. The design of the flag has evolved over time as new states joined the Union. The current version with 50 stars became official on July 4, 1960, after [[Hawaii]] became the 50th state.\r\n\r\nThe colors of the American flag also hold symbolic meaning. Red represents valor and bravery, white signifies purity and innocence, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe American flag is widely recognized and displayed in various contexts, including government buildings, schools, homes, and during public events and holidays such as Independence Day ([[fourth_of_july|July 4th]]). It is treated with respect and reverence, and there are guidelines and protocols for its proper handling, folding, and display.\r\n\r\nFor images that only show patterns or other symbols representing the United States rather than the flag itself, use the [[United States]] tag.\r\n\r\nh4.
