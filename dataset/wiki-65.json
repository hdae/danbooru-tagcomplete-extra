It was the first console released in the 16-bit era, albeit still utilizing an 8-bit CPU. Originally intended to \"beat\" the Nintendo [[Famicom]] (which it achieved in Japan), it ended up competing against the likes of the [[Sega Mega Drive]], [[Super Famicom]], and even the [[Neo Geo]] AES.\r\n\r\nThe TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit GPU; and is capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of 14 cm×14 cm×3.8 cm (5.5 in×5.5 in×1.5 in), [b]the NEC PC Engine holds the record for the world's smallest game console ever made[/b].\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, Telegames released a slightly altered version of the American model simply as the TurboGrafx around 1990 in extremely limited quantities. Although there was no full-scale PAL region release of the system, imported PC Engine consoles were largely available in France and Benelux through major retailers thanks to the unlicensed importer Sodipeng (Société de Distribution de la PC Engine, a subsidiary of Guillemot International).\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the PC Engine was very successful. It gained strong third-party support and outsold the Famicom at its 1987 debut, eventually becoming the Super Famicom's main rival. However, the TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and sold poorly, which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing. \r\n\r\nAt least 17 distinct models of the console were made, including portable versions and those that integrated the CD-ROM add-on. An enhanced model, the PC Engine SuperGrafx, was rushed to market in 1989. It featured many performance enhancements and was intended to supersede the standard PC Engine. It failed to catch on—only six titles were released that took advantage of the added power and it was quickly discontinued. The final model was discontinued in 1994. \r\n\r\nTwo major revisions, the [[PC Engine SuperGrafx]] and the PC Engine Duo, were released in 1989 and 1991, respectively. The entire series was succeed by the unsuccessful PC-FX in 1994, which was only released in Japan after the TurboGrafx-16 and its revised variants failed to gain enough market share in North America.\r\n\r\nNote that this tag is for a game console.

It was the first step before the intended subsequent invasion of Britain by the Germans ([i]\"Operation Sea Lion\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion[/i]).\r\n\r\nThe battle was the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces. The RAF was also supported by several squadrons of Polish pilots who escaped to Britain after the conquest of [[Poland]] by Nazi Germany. The British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as [b]the Blitz[/b], that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.\r\n\r\nThe battle ended with a British victory after they regained air superiority over the island. The failure of the Luftwaffe to subdue the UK along with the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union resulted into a cancellation of the planned invasion of Britain, allowing the UK and western allies to refocus their war effort to the North Africa campaign.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["バトル・オブ・ブリテン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":224961,"created_at":"2025-02-06T13:11:44.841-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-06T13:11:44.841-05:00","title":"lotus26","body":"[[AI-generated|AI]] prompter.

The other common name is jonquil, after a particular species of the family.\r\n\r\nDaffodil flowers grow at about a right angle to the stem and have a cup- or trumpet-shaped protruding center surrounded by 6 petal-like tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals). The flowers may come in a limited variety of colors, most often white and yellow, sometimes orange. Depending on the species, the tepals may be a different color than the center.\r\n\r\nIn the east, they are considered a symbol of wealth and good fortune, and since they bloom in early spring are often associated with the Chinese New Year. The bulbs are mildly poisonous and must be handled with care but were once a part of traditional Japanese medicine.\r\n\r\nh4.
