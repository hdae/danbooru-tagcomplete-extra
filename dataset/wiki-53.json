[i]Rebaxan Columni[/i] was the Chadra-Fan aliens' company responsible for the production of the MSE-6-series repair droid. \r\n\r\nThe MSE-series was a popular line of MSE Mouse Droids. These droids were usually programmed with a single function that varied per assignment. Once they were set on the task, they would do nothing else. \r\n\r\nThe MSE-Series General-Purpose Droid was originally sold to the Chadra-Fan homeworld. They mimicked the pleeky, a common household pet. They thought that the Galactic market would consider it \"cute\", and manufactured these droids in the billions. They sold very well at first but eventually  most of them were returned, as they reminded people of disease-carrying vermin. \r\n\r\nIn one event, the entire Aar'aa [[alien]] species sent them back. The reason was that the little droids skittering underfoot made them uncomfortably hungry. \r\n\r\nEventually [i]Rebaxan-Columni[/i] directors became so desperate that they offered every one of the droids to the Imperial Navy, as they were short on droids and needed to catch up with the other Imperial forces. They offered them for a small price and gave all to the [[Galactic Empire (star Wars)|]]; every ship in the fleet had hundreds of them. Their use was only limited by their owner's creativity.\r\n\r\nThe Mouse Droids were often used to carry messages in vast Imperial ships and battle stations as well as leading troops through mazes of corridors to their assigned posts. They also have two small internal arms and can do a variety of tasks such as sanitation and security. On the [[Death Star]]s they usually led [[stormtrooper]]s through its many hallways and levels. These droids were programmed to melt their processors upon capture, creating a small, localized explosion.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":76296,"created_at":"2016-06-08T01:27:16.556-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-27T09:32:53.959-04:00","title":"orson_krennic","body":"A character from the [[Star Wars]] science fiction series.\r\n\r\nHe appears in the [[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]] Anthology film from 2016.\r\n\r\n[b]Director Orson Krennic[/b] is a [[Galactic Empire (star Wars)|]] Military Director.

The Imperial-class Star Destroyers, along with Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s, represented the might of the Imperial Military throughout the [[galaxy]] during the reign of the Galactic Empire. \r\n\r\nThe Imperator-class was originally used by the Republic Navy toward the end of the Clone Wars, and served alongside the Tector-class in a few task forces during the conflict. It was at the time one of the largest warship classes in the Republic Navy.

Following the [[Jedi]] Purge, the class was renamed to Imperial, but the original name was used in some official documents. \r\n\r\nThe Imperator Star Destroyer is a triangle shaped massive spaceship armed with many turbo lasers, ion cannons and proton torpedo launchers. It has a bridge on top of its main superstructure, as well as a potent sensor array and two massive reflector shield generators above it. This vessel also has a hangar bay at the bottom, equipped with powerful tractor beams and with hundreds of [[TIE Fighter]]s and other dedicated military craft packed inside.\r\n\r\nIt came to symbolize the tyranny of Imperial rule and was used throughout the galaxy for many decades, even long after the fall of the Empire and the establishment of both the New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance, who appropriated many vessels and used them in their own navies.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["imperialstardestroyer"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":52757,"created_at":"2014-03-08T09:47:01.640-05:00","updated_at":"2024-09-27T09:32:53.832-04:00","title":"wehrmacht","body":"The  unified [[germany|German]] [[military|armed forces]] in [[World War II]], including the [i]Heer[/i] ([[Army]]), [i][[Luftwaffe]][/i] (Air Force) and [i][[Kriegsmarine]][/i] (Navy). \r\n\r\nSeparate from the [[Waffen-SS]], the paramilitary branch of the [[Nazi]] Party.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetics of Wehrmacht [[military uniform|uniforms]] influenced various fictional military factions such as the [[Galactic Empire (star Wars)|]], [[Protect Gear]] armor from [[Kerberos Saga]], [[Zanscare]], as well as [[Zeon]] and [[Neo Zeon]].\r\n* !post #7976714: From left to rightーUniforms with their respective insignia of the Heer, Waffen SS, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe. \r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[Fallschirmjaeger|Fallschirmjäger]]\r\n* [[Russian Liberation Army]]\r\n* [[Stahlhelm]]\r\n* [[List of Uniforms]]\r\nh1.

The tentacles themselves contain a penis or a vagina inside the tips.\r\n\r\nOn 4chan, the species was nicknamed with the term [[sea angel]] due to their sleek, aquatic appearance.

However, both women were replaced by the male characters \"Sid\" and \"Billy\" for the western SNES home console versions of Final Fight released in 1991. Allegedly, this was done to appease concerns of players beating up female characters.\r\n\r\nRumours about her gender, coupled with her very sexualized and [[curvy]] design, gained Poison unusual fame.

In a 2011 interview, he stated that Capcom does not have an official stance on Poison's gender, and it is left to the viewer's interpretation.\r\n\r\nh4.
