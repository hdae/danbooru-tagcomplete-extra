This second arm can be either 'open' or clenched closed, and is usually also holding another object: generally a test tube, flask, ray gun, wrench, or some other 'sciencey' implement.\r\n\r\nh4.

Known as the NX during development. The first production model went on sale on March 3rd, 2017. \r\n\r\nThe Nintendo Switch has two dedicated [[game controller]]s (one for each hand) called [[Joy-Con]]s. These can be attached to and removed from the console at will, essentially making it a hybrid home/handheld platform.\r\n\r\nA smaller version, the [[nintendo switch lite|Switch Lite]], was revealed July 10th, 2019, built strictly for handheld gaming. The Lite has no detachable Joy-Cons; the controllers are hard-built into the console. It also has no HDMI output so cannot be connected to a TV like the original model Switch can. A [[nintendo switch - oled model|higher-end version]] featuring an OLED screen was released on October 8, 2021. \r\n\r\nThe platform has enjoyed a positive reception and high sales numbers in the years since its release. In addition to carrying many popular flagship titles like [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]] and [[Super Mario Odyssey]], the Switch has also become a welcoming home for many older games from last-gen systems. This led the Switch to be the [i]de facto[/i] portable way to play popular older titles like [[Diablo 3]], [[Dark Souls I]] and [[Castle Crashers]] which had previously only been playable on non-portable platforms. As of early 2023, the combined Switch product line is one of the best-selling platforms in Nintendo's entire history, outselling both the [[Wii]] and the [[Game Boy]] and now second only to the [[Nintendo DS]].\r\n\r\nFor tagging purposes, if the Switch has its Joy-Cons detached (or is being controlled by other compatible controllers), tag it as a [[game console]] (post #3259420, post #3528468). If the Switch has at least one Joy-Con connected or the console itself is the Lite, tag it as a [[handheld game console]] (post #3471232, post #3470179).\r\n\r\nh4.

Initially rooted in the Azov Special Operations Forces (SSO) and [[Territorial_Defence_Forces_(Ukraine)|Territorial Defense]] volunteers, the brigade was officially integrated into the Ukrainian military structure in January 2023. It has since played a pivotal role in intense combat operations, including the defense of Bakhmut and the liberation of areas like Kherson and Andriivka.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch like its predecessor, the Azov Regiment, the 3rd Assault Brigade has faced scrutiny for its historical ties to far-right ideologies and the use of symbols such as the [[Wolfsangel]] in its early days, sparking controversy over alleged neo-Nazi associations. Critics point to its origins within the broader Azov movement, while supporters argue it has evolved into a professional fighting force, distancing itself from extremist roots as it merged with the Ground Forces. Russian propaganda continues to amplify these criticisms, portraying the brigade as a symbol of extremism to justify its actions in the conflict.

However, some experts argue that the regiment has evolved beyond its origins as street militia, tempering its neo-Nazi underpinnings as it became part of the Ukranian National Guard. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, criticism of the Azov Regiment has been a recurring theme of Russian politics and more recently as [[Vladimir Putin]]'s justification for invading Ukraine, the prominence of the unit in Ukraine's military forces being expanded and exaggerated by Russian media to this day.\r\n\r\nThe most recent official Azov Regiment logo now only uses a heavily altered Wolfsangel symbol, while the SSO (special forces) units don't use it at all (they use a [[tryzub]] formed out of swords instead).\r\n\r\nh4.
