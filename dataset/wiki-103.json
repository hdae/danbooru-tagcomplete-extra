Axis positions near El Alamein, only 106 km (66 mi) from Alexandria, were dangerously close to the ports and cities of Egypt, the base facilities of the Commonwealth forces and the Suez Canal. However, the Axis forces were too far from their base at Tripoli in Libya to remain at El Alamein indefinitely, which led both sides to accumulate supplies for more offensives, against the constraints of time and distance. The first battle of El Alamein officialy ended in a stalement.\r\n\r\nThis battle and the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] three months later remain important to some of the countries that took part. In [[New Zealand]], this is due to the country's significant contribution to the defense of El Alamein, especially the heavy role the Māori Battalion played.

It was involved in several wars throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, including Russo-Japanese war, both Sino-Japanese wars, and [[World War II]].\r\n\r\nThe IJA became infamous throughout the world during 30s and 40s due to their countless war crimes and atrocities commited during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and other conflicts in Asia (including but not limited to: cannibalism, large-scale rape, mass-murder, use of chemical and biological weapons, \"forced human experimentation on captured civilians\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731 , guerillas, and murder and torture of prisoners of war) committed during this time period (especially during the rule of [[toujou_hideki|Hideki Tojo]].) With some even suggest them to be even worse than the [[Nazi]] Germany regime itself.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Japanese surrender, the IJA was dissolved and during 1950s its role as Japan's military's land warfare branch was taken over by the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] which was modeled after the US Army.\r\n\r\nh1.
