Obsidian is hard and brittle; it therefore fractures with very sharp edges, which had been used in the past in cutting and piercing tools, and are still used as surgical scalpel blades.\r\n\r\nWell-crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. \r\n\r\nPlinths for audio turntables have been made of obsidian since the 70s.\r\n\r\nObsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a [[obsidian (gemstone)|gemstone]].

For example, \"se\" or \"sec\" work in place of s or seconds. \r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{age:2weeks..1mo}}\r\n\r\n[i]Note: not specifying the time unit is no longer supported and will return no results. \"m\" will also return no results as it is ambiguous between minutes and months.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: singular and plural forms of units can be used interchangeably.[/i]\r\n\r\nh6. Filesize units\r\n\r\nThese units are used together with the [i]filesize[/i] metatag.\r\n\r\n* b (bytes)\r\n* kb (kilobytes)\r\n* m (megabytes)\r\n\r\nOnly the shorthand versions will work, i.e. bytes, kilobytes and megabytes are not part of the syntax.\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{filesize:<=10kb}}\r\n\r\n[i]Note: if no unit is specified it defaults to bytes.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: for anyone curious, 1m = 1024kb and 1kb = 1024b.[/i]\r\n\r\nh6. Ratios\r\n\r\nFor the metatag [i]ratio[/i], fractions are commonly used but you may use decimal notation also.\r\n\r\nThe aspect ratio denotes the relationship between the width and height of an image. For example, a 1:1 ratio means the width and height are equal whereas a 4:3 ratio means the width is one third longer (4/3) than the height. Useful aspect ratio tool: http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n[code]ratio:[width]/[height]\r\nratio:[number][/code]\r\n\r\n[i]Examples:[/i]\r\n* {{ratio:16/9}}\r\n* {{ratio:1.78}}\r\n\r\n[i]Note: colons are supported in place of slashes; e.g., {{ratio:16:9}}.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Note: using ratios won't always result in pixel perfect results as the ratios are rounded to two decimal points, i.e. a search for {{ratio:16/9}} may result in a picture with the dimensions 1920x1078 instead of 1920x1080.[/i]\r\n\r\nh6. Why should you use ratios?\r\n\r\nRatios can be used to assist in finding wallpapers. For example, if you have a 1920x1080 monitor, you can use {{ratio:16/9 width:>=1920}} to find wallpapers for it.\r\n\r\nh6. Tip\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid calculating ratios altogether, then you can use dimensions directly.\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{ratio:1920/1200}} is equivalent to {{ratio:8/5}}\r\n\r\nh6. \"Basic syntax\":[#dtext-basic]\r\n\r\nYou can use basic syntax with ratios; though, take note if you use fractions.\r\n\r\nFirst, the site will calculate all fractions into a decimal notation and round it off to two decimals, e.g. {{ratio:16:9}} becomes {{ratio:1.78}}.\r\n\r\nAt this point it's regular numbers and normal basic syntax will work as expected.\r\n\r\n[i]Example:[/i]\r\n{{ratio:16/10..16/9}} becomes {{ratio:1.6..1.78}} (Note: 16/9..16/10 won't work. See under Intervals on this page)\r\n{{ratio:..16/9}} becomes {{ratio:..1.78}}\r\n\r\nh4.
