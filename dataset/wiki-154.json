Tiger anthromorphs are born in their tiger form. When they begin to realize their abilities, they can change freely between their tiger and human forms at will. Kanna also had a hard time changing into her human form at first, but she can now change freely from practicing. She can even transform only certain body parts as well. Kanna usually stays as a tiger, but she fell in love with using human objects after coming to Heavenhold. Now she stays in her human form instead.\r\n\r\nShe's Kang's older sister, and loves her little brother very much. There are only a few Tiger anthromorphs, and they have strong family bonds. However, Kanna's love for Kang is quite eccentric even for the rare white tiger anthromorphs. Kanna taught her little brother how to take his first steps and guided him on his first hunt. She came to Heavenhold because Kang had followed the Knight there first. She's always watching Kang from a distance, but rarely Intervenes. She believes personal growth can only be achieved by overcoming threats.\r\n\r\nKanna calls herself an exceptional Druid, but everyone else seems to think differently. Everyone rather believes the title of 'Super Anthromorph' is more fitting because of her amazing grip strength. She loves animals and plants. Despite Kanna's love, all the animals are afraid of her and the plants she raises end up wilting. Kanna severely injured a cute puppy by accident from petting it. After the incident, she claims she can only watch the cute and lovely animals from afar and does so. Kanna still calls herself a 'Druid' because of her ability to tame predators. No matter how ferocious, a loving and 'powerful' embrace from Kanna turns them into gentle lambs. \r\n\r\nEveryone can tell Kanna's strength is what definitely makes the predators submit. But no one has objected to Kanna's claim that she's a Druid because she can transform freely from beast and human form and tame predators.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147515,"created_at":"2022-07-26T14:21:12.868-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T14:22:30.012-04:00","title":"batsugun","body":"[i][b]Batsugun[/b][/i] is a 1993 [[science fiction]] vertically scrolling \"bullet hell\" [[arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed and published by [[Toaplan]] in [[Japan]] and published in Europe by [[Taito]], as well as in [[Korea]] by Unite Trading. \r\n\r\nThe last shoot 'em up created by Toaplan, the title takes place on a distant Earth-like planet where a global takeover operative led by king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII is set into motion, as players assume the role from one of the six fighter pilots conforming the Skull Hornets squadron taking control of submersible jets in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invading military force from the planet. \r\n\r\nIts gameplay mainly consists of shooting mixed with role-playing game-esque elements using a main two-button configuration.\r\n\r\nHeaded by Fire Shark designer Tataka Yuko, Batsugun was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and who would later go on to join one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 to continue working in the bullet hell sub-genre. \r\n\r\nThough first launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the [[Sega Saturn]] by Gazelle and published exclusively in Japan by [[Banpresto]] on 25 October 1996, featuring various changes and additions compared with the original version.\r\n\r\nBatsugun garnered positive reception from during its initial release in arcades but was later met with mixed critical reception on the Saturn as an import title. Nevertheless, the game garnered awards from Gamest magazine. It has been heralded by many as the first manic shooter due to its evolution of various gameplay features in the shoot 'em up genre and as an inspiration for other similar titles. \r\n\r\nAs of 2019, the rights to the project are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Yuge Masahiro and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":128192,"created_at":"2021-09-19T12:08:31.565-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T13:15:03.427-04:00","title":"mandragora_(arknights)","body":"Mandragora is a boss enemy in [[Arknights]] and the final boss of Episode 09.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["蔓德拉","マンドラゴラ","マンドラゴラ(アークナイツ)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147508,"created_at":"2022-07-26T12:42:08.612-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T12:42:08.612-04:00","title":"queen_mother_of_the_west","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["西王母"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147503,"created_at":"2022-07-26T06:22:14.366-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T06:29:25.159-04:00","title":"covered_piercing","body":"Where the impression of a [[piercing]] can be seen through clothing.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147502,"created_at":"2022-07-26T05:46:04.740-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T05:46:04.740-04:00","title":"nokkers_(fumetsu_no_anata_e)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ノッカー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147500,"created_at":"2022-07-26T03:33:40.406-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T03:33:40.406-04:00","title":"kuramochi_keito","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["倉持恵都"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147497,"created_at":"2022-07-26T01:42:53.012-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-26T01:42:53.012-04:00","title":"1g","body":"For the artist formerly tagged here, see [[1g no izumi]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":147493,"created_at":"2022-07-25T22:23:56.741-04:00","updated_at":"2022-07-25T22:23:56.741-04:00","title":"inari_(sennen_sensou_aigis)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["妖狐イナリ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":51067,"created_at":"2013-12-14T13:41:13.091-05:00","updated_at":"2022-07-25T22:11:48.027-04:00","title":"seed","body":"The fetal form of a plant.

This summer, she's the lifeguard in charge of safety on the beach!\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the news about rising injuries on the beach when it's supposed to be a fun vacation spot during the sweltering summer, Succubus Adventurer Yuze took on the role of a lifeguard. Even when there aren't any accidents happening, the sight of Yuze standing on the lifeguard tower overseeing the beach with binoculars makes it feels as if dangers in and out of the water disappear. If an accident really does happen, Yuze will rush to the scene. Whether they're on the sands, in the middle of the ocean, or deep underwater she always rescues those in danger. Yuze will not stop, no matter how sweaty or wet she gets! Thanks to her, people struck by 'someone' while on a stroll or swimmers flailing in the water because of a sudden grenade launched by 'someone' are able to make it to safety.\r\n\r\nShe uses her monster-handling skills and powerful grip as an adventurer to face off against the dangers without any hesitation, whether it's a shark or Sohee. Her specially enchanted lifebuoy aids those she rescues by giving them a speedy recovery with healing spells and makes suppressing threats easier with offensive spells.\r\n\r\nYuze takes her role as a lifeguard with utmost seriousness, but can't just understand why she's gathering more energy faster compared to when she streams her adventures on NewTube. The conclusion Yuze could come up with was: 'the scenes of rescue are direr compared to adventuring on NewTube, so that's why they must be more popular.' There's been a shortage of lifeguards on the beach ever since Sohee emerged, but when Yuze started volunteering as a lifeguard, more people recently started signing up for the task as well.

Styling\r\n\r\nStyles can be applied to the embedded notes box by using the CSS class \"note-box-attributes\". Allowed styles applied to an element with this class will apply the styles to the outer note box. It's best to use an empty element to avoid apply the same styles twice to inner text.\r\n\r\nh6. Allowed styles\r\n\r\n* [code]background-color[/code] - Sets the background color the box.\r\n* [code]border-radius[/code] - Sets the radiuses of the 4 box corners. \"[1]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n* [code]transform[/code] - Applies a transformation to the box. \"[2]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n** The only allowed transformation is a rotation.\r\n* [code]justify-content[/code] - Sets the horizontal alignment of inner containers. \"[3]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n** [b]flex-start[/b] - Left alignment.\r\n** [b]flex-end[/b] - Right alignment.\r\n** Not the same as \"text-align\", which is used to set the text alignment of an inner container.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] Without this the note box defaults to a center alignment.[/tn]\r\n* [code]align-items[/code] - Sets the vertical alignment of inner containers. \"[4]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n** [b]flex-start[/b] - Top alignment.\r\n** [b]flex-end[/b] - Bottom alignment.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] Without this the note box defaults to a center alignment.[/tn]\r\n\r\nh6.

Stacking order\r\n\r\nSince embedded notes are opaque, there is the possibility that one note box could cover up a portion of another box, to include the text in that box. However, the order of which box goes over which can be controlled by adding an additional class to the [code]note-box-attributes[/code] element: [code]level-1[/code], [code]level-2[/code], [code]level-3[/code], [code]level-4[/code], [code]level-5[/code]. \r\n\r\nA box with a higher level will be placed over a box with a lower level, e.g. a [code]level-2[/code] note box would be seen above a [code]level-1[/code] note box.\r\n\r\n[tn][b]Caveat:[/b] Note boxes without a level set are at the lowest level, almost like a level 0.[/tn]\r\n\r\nh6. Examples\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n<div class=\"note-box-attributes level-1\"></div>\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nh5. Alignment\r\n\r\nAs mentioned under the [b]Styling[/b] section \"above\":[#dtext-styling], [code]align-items[/code] and [code]justify-content[/code] can be used to set the placement of the text containers inside the note box, since by default, the text containers are aligned towards the center of the note box. In order to get this to work properly, the text containers must be block elements, which can be achieved by either surrounding the text with a [code]<div></div>[/code] text container, or by choosing another HTML container tag (e.g. [code]<span></span>[/code]) and setting the [b]display[/b] style to \"block\".\r\n\r\nTo set the horizontal alignment of the text inside the text containers, you must also use a block text container and set the [code]text-align[/code] style property to either [b]left[/b], [b]right[/b], [b]center[/b], or [b]justify[/b]. \"[5]\":[#dtext-external-links]\r\n\r\nh6.
