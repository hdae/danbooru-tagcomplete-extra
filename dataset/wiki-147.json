The name comes from the GRAU index. 1PN is the GRAU index of night vision devices, where PN stands for [i]Nochnoy Pritsel[/i] (Russian: Ночной прицел) meaning night sight. It is also called NSPUM (НСПУМ) or NSPU-1. The scope was introduced into Soviet [[military]] service in the early 1970s and is still used by many of the Soviet Union's successor states, and has been used in numerous armed conflicts around the world.\r\n\r\nThe 1PN58 gathers light into a refractor which can be protected with an aperture cover. The center of the cover has a circular aperture with dark glass allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier. For zeroing the sight the left side of the scope has two perpendicular knobs, of which the elevation knob has a detachable scale. The scope comes with seven different, detachable elevation scales, one for each of the supported weapons.

The [[rifle]] was designed by German small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch, and shares design and engineering with their [[h&k g36|G36]] rifle.\r\nThe XM8 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle, firing from a closed rotary bolt. Its design and functioning is similar to that of the G36, of which it is a derivative.\r\n\r\nThe materials used to build the XM8 are almost entirely composites, with the notable exception of the cold-hammer-forged steel barrel. Preliminary tests in [[desert]] and arctic conditions have shown the XM8 to be a rugged weapon, though some complaints arose.\r\n\r\nWhile the XM8 fell out of favor with the US military, Heckler & Koch sought to market the rifle globally. In the meantime, the Malaysian Armed Forces expressed interest in using the rifle and by 2007 openly stated its intention to purchase the XM8 rifle. By 2010, the Royal Malaysian Navy special unit PASKAL began using the XM8 along with other Heckler & Koch assault rifles including the [[h&k hk416|HK416]] and G36.\r\n\r\n\"Wikipedia page\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_XM8]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":154893,"created_at":"2022-12-18T23:10:01.360-05:00","updated_at":"2022-12-18T23:10:01.360-05:00","title":"last-ditch_effort","body":"[[Cyberpunk]] action-adventure game by [b]Moonwell Games[/b].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":154886,"created_at":"2022-12-18T20:54:02.374-05:00","updated_at":"2022-12-18T22:52:32.373-05:00","title":"exploding_watermelon_challenge","body":"A challenge in which [[rubber band]]s are placed around a [[watermelon]] until it explodes.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スイカ輪ゴム実験","輪ゴムスイカ割りチャレンジ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145018,"created_at":"2022-06-09T17:51:03.253-04:00","updated_at":"2022-12-18T22:32:45.296-05:00","title":"miyako_(real)_(princess_connect!)","body":"A character from [[Princess Connect!|Princess Connect!

The late wrestling legend [[Eddie Guerrero]] has a variation of the Texas Cloverleaf where he performs the maneuver from a standing position, which enabled him to pull the opponent's legs up high enough to where he could add pressure to the hold by sticking one of his knees into the other wrestler's back.

To preserve Japan's territories, coastal cities sprung up, one after the other. Eventually, they became marine cities, and along with the expansion of sea-lanes to connect them, the need arose for a sizable staff to protect the seas.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, maritime jobs were becoming more popular among women. Hence, the Blue Mermaids, tasked with keeping the seas safe, had become every female student's dream job. This is when childhood friends Akeno Misaki and Moeka China enroll in a marine high school in Yokosuka, along with other girls who share their goal of becoming a Blue Mermaid.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4.
