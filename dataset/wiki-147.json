Even though G3s were officially classified as battlecruisers in design they were closer to what we would today consider fast battleships; featuring main battery of 9 406mm guns mounted in three triple turrets, 16 155mm secondary guns in 8 twin turrets, 356mm (magazines) to 305mm (machinery spaces) thick armored belt, 203mm to 73mm thick armored deck (areas around magazines being once again significantly more heavily armored than those around machinery spaces), heavily armored turrets  (444mm thick faces, 330mm to 229mm sides, 203mm roof), and armored bulkheads 305mm to 254mm thick, with design speed of 32 knots and full displacement of 54k tons. G3's most notable feature (and the one which allowed to it to as heavily armored as it was) was its rather unorthodox turret placement; 2 turrets (A and B) forward with B turret superfiring over A turret, one turret midship (X), this layout allowed the armor to be concentrated in much smaller area than it would had been possible if a more conventional turret layout had been used.

Although he still secretly pines for his days on the battlefield, his injury ensures he will likely never pull a chariot again. He tries hard to maintain a calm and professional demeanor in front of his students, and has convinced himself that he behaves logically and rationally, but in truth, he has inherited much of his former master's bombast and bravado. His impulsive side comes through when he gets worked up, and he often ends up acting before he thinks. He has even been known to forget about his injury in the heat of the moment and try to break into a sprint, only to be painfully reminded of it moments later.

It follows [[Freyjadour Falenas]], the prince of Falena, as he leads a rebellion against the usurpers who overthrew his mother. Unlike every other game of the series, Freyjadour does not become the host of a True Rune.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in response to the mixed reaction to [i][[Gensou Suikoden III]][/i] and generally negative reaction to [i]Gensou Suikoden IV[/i], [i]Gensou Suikoden V[/i] hearkens back heavily to [i][[Gensou Suikoden II]][/i], which is widely regarded as the high point of the series. Many [i]Gensou Suikoden II[/i] characters appear or are alluded to in [i]Gensou Suikoden V[/i], and the gameplay eliminates most of the changes introduced in later games in favor of an upgraded version of [i]Gensou Suikoden II[/i]'s battle system. This effort to restore fans' faith in the series seems to have worked, as [i]Gensou Suikoden V[/i] is generally regarded as the second best of the series, with many even ranking it as the best.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["幻想水滸伝V","幻想水滸伝5","幻水V","幻水5"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129826,"created_at":"2021-10-30T05:19:19.183-04:00","updated_at":"2021-10-30T05:19:19.183-04:00","title":"egawa_kusumi","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["江川樟美"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":75522,"created_at":"2016-05-14T23:36:55.482-04:00","updated_at":"2021-10-30T03:06:55.703-04:00","title":"no_male_underwear","body":"A male character not wearing [[male underwear]] under [[pants]], [[shorts]] or similar lower-body clothing.\r\n\r\nIf the character has no lower-body clothing (ie pants, etc) at all, use [[bottomless]].\r\n\r\nUse [[no panties]] or [[no bra]] for the female equivalent.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129824,"created_at":"2021-10-29T23:46:44.962-04:00","updated_at":"2021-10-29T23:46:44.962-04:00","title":"mahoroba_youjo_kitan","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["まほろば妖女奇譚","まほたん"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":21964,"created_at":"2010-08-26T16:35:51.562-04:00","updated_at":"2021-10-29T22:50:49.720-04:00","title":"strength_(black_rock_shooter)","body":"A [[white eyes|white]] (or [[yellow eyes|yellow]]) eyed, [[dark-skinned female|dark skinned]], [[white hair]]ed girl who was featured in the [[Black_Rock_Shooter|Black ★ Rock Shooter OVA]] and TV series.

Her parents were highly sought-after business consultants and coaches for powerful CEOs around the world. Though her parents paid little attention to her (mostly leaving her in the care of the family’s omnic butler, [[bob (overwatch)|Bob]]), they ensured that Ashe had every opportunity to succeed. But a chance meeting with a local ruffian, named [[cassidy (overwatch)|Jesse McCree]], and an impromptu string of crimes committed together opened her eyes to her true calling. The satisfaction of outwitting her targets and the thrill of getting away with it set her on the outlaw path.\r\n\r\nAlong with the other three founders of the Deadlock Gang, Ashe started to make a name for herself with bigger and more extravagant heists. The Deadlock Gang’s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together.\r\n\r\nAshe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). Her principles: keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal.\r\n\r\nNo longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe is now writing her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that has put her at top of the authorities’ most-wanted lists and cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend.\r\n\r\nh4.
