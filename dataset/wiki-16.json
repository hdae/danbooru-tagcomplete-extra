Born in Vienna in Lower Austria, after naturalization in Japan, he changed his name to Takeyama Atsumi. Founder and center of the famous rock group ATSSOL. The sixth Chancellor of the [[Holy Roman Empire (Chronicle of Myers)|Holy Roman Reich]] after its restoration. He is protagonist of \"Keirichslied\".\r\n\r\nIt is said that Keirich's rock style is somewhat close to that of John Lennon.\r\n\r\nHe is the father of Takeyama Ai and [[Stellus Keirich|Takeyama Hoshi]], and has lived as [[Shibatou Atsumi]].\r\n\r\nh6. Trivia\r\n* Some of Keirich's service in the Knights is a reference to real-life Korean stars who have partially served in the military, such as G-DRAGON.\r\n* Keirich dislikes being called a \"sound nerd\" or a \"noisemaker\" the most.\r\n* Keirich has dual German and Austrian citizenship (because his birthplace of Vienna is part of the Austrian region until after 2045, when Keirich renounced his Holy Roman citizenship and became a Japanese citizen and changed his name to Atsumi Takeyama), but after the re-establishment of the Holy Roman Reich, he even rocked the national anthem of the Holy Roman Republic \"Kaiserhymne\" in the capital Rome, which was appreciated by the Holy Roman Kaiser [[George Myers|George I]]. He was naturalized as a Japanese citizen after the end of World War III.\r\n* Keirich's music genre is J-POP.\r\n* Keirich is a music-game player.\r\n* Keirich's date of birth is March 13, which is the same time as the Anschluss.\r\n* Some of Keirich's early settings are similar to those of the ''[[Love Live!]]'' series characters [[Kosaka Honoka]] (personality), [[Shibuya Kanon]] (guitar), and [[Wien Margarete]] (Austrian nationality), but Keirich and Honoka share the same color and hair color.\r\n* Some of Keirich's later settings are references to Hoshino Ai from Oshi no Ko.\r\n* [spoilers]Keirich was the only Holy Roman Chancellor to be assassinated, and his death was very similar to that of the third presidents of the Republic of Korea, Park Chung-hee and John Lennon and [[Hoshino Ai (oshi no ko)|]] from ''[[Oshi no Ko]]''.[/spoilers]\r\n* Keirich is not very good at cooking, not to mention that tempura is sometimes made with cheese and sausage.\r\n* Keirich occupies center-position (far right) in the poster for the 2057 ATSSOL concert in London, similar to [[John Lennon]] on the album cover of [[Abbey Road]] in reality.\r\n\r\nh4.

When fans online discovered this, it quickly became a meme, with many fan artists exaggerating Aine's bust size in their illustrations.

She is one of many \"Friends\" in Japari Park.\r\n\r\nShe first appeared in the original 2015 mobile game, and later appeared in [[Kemono Friends Pavilion]] and [[Kemono Friends 3]] with an updated character design. In these games, she tends to be depicted as an energetic Friend with a good sense of responsibility; this is fairly different from other bat Friends, who tend to be easygoing and/or tricksters. This may be inspired by the brown long-eared bat's unique nature as a species, being a relatively slow-flying and largely diurnal bat.\r\n\r\nIn September 2022, a [[virtual YouTuber]] based on Brown Long-Eared Bat debuted under the franchise's [[Kemono Friends V Project]] label as a member of its second wave, debuting alongside [[Siberian Chipmunk (Kemono Friends)|]] and [[Jungle Cat (Kemono Friends)|]]. KemoV's Brown Long-Eared Bat, commonly addressed by her nickname <i>Usako</i>, is a peppy and humorous girl who enjoys horror games and incorporates verbal tics associated with her [[Kemono Friends 3]] counterpart into her speech. She has a notably different design from her video game counterpart, having [[official alternate hair length|longer hair]] featuring a [[official alternate streak color|pink streak]] and a [[alternate breast size (larger)|dramatically larger chest]] as well as the [[official alternate costume|differing outfit]] that most other KemoV streamers have compared to their inspirations.\r\n\r\nh4.
