Her [i]nom de guerre[/i] is the codename [b]Killer Bee[/b] (christened in [[Street Fighter Zero (series)|Street Fighter Zero 3]] and kept for herself afterwards). She first appeared in the fighting game [[Street Fighter II (series)|Super Street Fighter II]] (1993) as one of the titular \"New Challengers,\" the four new characters introduced in that title. She is the second female character in the Street Fighter series, following [[Chun-Li]].\r\n\r\nCammy is a female clone of [[M. Bison]], originally serving within his organization Shadaloo as both Bison's potential replacement body should his original body fail, and, until then, the leader of the [[Shadaloo dolls|\"Dolls\"]] - Bison's personal unit of brainwashed bodyguards and underlings. She later went rogue after her encounter with [[Dhalsim]] nullified Bison's Psycho Powered mind control. As of [[Street Fighter II (series)|]] onward to the present in [[Street Fighter 6]], she serves as a member of Delta Red, a British special forces unit with connections to MI6. She has made it her personal mission to locate, rescue, and rehabilitate the Dolls. She collaborates closely with most of the other World Warriors on her assignments, notably [[Chun-Li]].\r\n\r\nTrained extensively in close-quarters combat, Cammy likes to strike with quick, sharp attacks like a stinging bee (hence her codename) and use takedowns to immobilize and cripple her foes. Her signature techniques include the [i]Spiral Arrow[/i] and [i]Cannon Spike/Strike[/i] - both flying kick attacks that send Cammy lunging feet first at sharp angles, whether straight forward, up into the sky, or down from the air - as well as the [i]Hooligan Combination[/i], where she hurls herself into close quarters to either grapple the opponent to the ground or strike from odd angles.\r\n\r\nh4.

[[Street Fighter V]] adds a [[chest harness]] and a [[thigh holster]] on her right leg, but loses the green patches of [[bodypaint]] originally seen on her legs. The bodypaint does make a return in Street Fighter 6 as part of her Street Fighter V form/\"younger self\" alternate skin. Her appearance in [[Fortnite]] as a Gaming Legends outfit skin adds [[pantyhose]] with a [[camouflage]] pattern to her Street Fighter V outfit.\r\n\r\nIn her Alpha/Zero \"Killer Bee\" appearance, which takes place during the time she was a member of M. Bison's Dolls, she instead wears a light blue long-sleeved [[ribbed leotard|ribbed]] [[highleg leotard]] with a matching color [[garrison cap]] and a small yellow necktie with a black armband on her left arm. Like in her original form, she has bodypaint patches on her legs, except they are blue to match her leotard and somewhat [[lightning bolt symbol|lightning bolt]]-shaped.\r\n\r\nIn [[Street Fighter 6]], Cammy has [[short hair|cut her hair short]], and she now sports a [[blue jacket|blue]] [[cropped jacket|bolero]] with [[Union Jack]] print, [[black sports bra]] and black [[yoga pants]].\r\n\r\nh5.

Simplified: 春丽) is a character in the [[Street Fighter]] series by [[Capcom]]. She is the first female playable character to appear in a 1-on-1 fighting game.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in [[Street Fighter II (series)|]], Chun-Li was the youngest member of the roster and only female character in the game, the self-proclaimed \"strongest woman in the world,\" and while not as physically powerful as the other characters, she was by far the quickest. Her most famous attack is the [i]Hyakuretsukyaku[/i] (\"Hundred Crack Legs\", alternately known as \"Lightning Legs\"), where she repeatedly kicks her opponent from a tilted standing position with incredible speed.\r\n\r\nIn the Street Fighter series, Chun-Li was an Interpol investigator from [[China]] who had been searching for clues to the recent death of her father. Getting into a friendly spar with an old teacher of hers and friend of her father, [[Gen (street fighter)|]], he gives her a lead into who may have killed her father—the mysterious crime syndicate Shadaloo and its tyrannical leader [[M. Bison]]. After an encounter where M. Bison confirms he slew her father, a tearful Chun-Li swore vengeance and made it her life's mission to destroy Shadaloo and bring M. Bison to justice. She collaborated closely with [[Guile]], [[Cammy White]], [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|]], and the other World Warriors throughout the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter M. Bison's supposedly final death during [[Street Fighter V]], her mission complete, Chun-Li retired from Interpol and opened an orphanage to live a quieter life.

What defines a character?\r\n\r\nGenerally, it is self-evident who are characters and what aren't. For example, [[Edward Elric]], [[Pikachu]], and [[Simon (ttgl)|]] are obviously characters, while the [[philosopher's stone]], [[Ecruteak City]], and the [[core drill]] are not.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes it isn't as clear cut. While there is no official policy on what a character is, the unofficial rule of thumb seems to be: [b]If it talks, acts on its own, or is otherwise shown to be sentient in the source material (game, anime, manga, novel), it is a character.[/b]\r\n\r\nThus, something can be considered a character even if it is an object, for example [[Bardiche (nanoha)|]] or Plankton's computer wife [[Karen (spongebob)|]].\r\n\r\nh5. What types of things SHOULD NOT be a character tag?\r\n\r\nLocations and non-[[mecha]] vehicles are not characters. (See forum #34022)\r\n\r\nSometimes, artists draw an object (computer, software, vehicle, food, etc.) as a humanoid. This is called a [[personification]]. However, the object is still not considered a character, so it should remain a general tag. If the personified version becomes a character in its own right, a separate character tag can be created for it. For example, [[strawberry]] is the food and [[strawberry-chan]] is the personification.\r\n\r\nh5. How to make a character tag.\r\n\r\nTo make a tag be a character tag, prefix it with \"character:\" or \"char:\". Remember to replace spaces with underscores (like_this).\r\n\r\nh6. Name and Name Order\r\n\r\nCharacter tags should be the same name and name order that are used in the original source material. For example, [[Kiyama Hiroto]], not \"Hiroto Kiyama\" or \"Xavier Foster\". If an alternate name, such as a nickname or a name from the English version, is widely used, you may \"request an alias\":[/bulk_update_requests/new] from that to the original language title.\r\n\r\nHowever, some copyrights are [b]exceptions[/b] to this rule. Characters from the following should be tagged with their [b]English-language names[/b] when possible:\r\n* [b][[Ace Attorney]] (Gyakuten Saiban)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Advance Wars]] (Famicom Wars)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Animal Crossing]] (Doubutsu no Mori)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Castlevania (series)|]] (Akumajou Dracula)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Final Fantasy]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Fire Emblem]][/b]\r\n** <tn>To be tagged with the names used in the North American localizations (preferably [i]Fire Emblem Heroes[/i]). See topic #16149.</tn>\r\n* [b][[Golden Sun]] (Ougon no Taiyou)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Granblue Fantasy]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Kid Icarus]] (Hikari Shinwa)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Mario (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Mega Man (series)|]] (Rockman)[/b]\r\n* [b][[Monster Hunter (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Pokemon]][/b] (human and creature)\r\n* [b][[Splatoon (series)|]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Tales of (series)|Tales of...]][/b]\r\n* [b][[Xenoblade Chronicles (series)|]][/b]\r\n\r\nh6. Follow [[howto:romanize]].\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure how to romanize the character's name, ask in a comment or on the forum.\r\n\r\nh6. Only one name?\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, characters should be tagged with their full name. However, some characters are only known by a single name (like [[Chen]]). Other times, their full name may be considered a spoiler. Usually these should be tagged with the single name, adding a _(series) qualifier if it is ambiguous. (See [[help:qualifiers]])\r\nIf only their surname is known (e.g. same as their spouse or children), or if the full name is not well-known, it may be appropriate to tag them Mr. or Mrs. Surname. (or Dr. or Professor, etc)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* [[asuna_(sao)]]\r\n* [[yamada_(b-gata_h-kei)]]\r\n* [[bobby_(fma)]]\r\n* [[yuki_(touhou)]]\r\n* [[mrs._bradley]]\r\n* [[mr._koiwai]]\r\n\r\nHowever, if a character is from a game which is self-titled (title comes from character's name, resulting in a [code]character_(series)[/code] copyright tags), it should be left off. Example:\r\n\r\n* [[Mario]] of [[Mario (Series)]]\r\n* [[Kirby]] of [[Kirby (Series)]]\r\n\r\nIn the case of [[original]] characters, the tag should be qualified using the name of the person who designed it. This includes artists as well as non-artists, such as commissioners. The qualifier should be consistent with the name of the artist tag used on the site. Examples:\r\n\r\n* [[Lokulo-chan (Lokulo no Mawashimono)]] by the artist [[Lokulo no Mawashimono]]\r\n* [[Alyssa (SpeckTech)]] by the commissioner SpeckTech\r\n\r\nh6. No name!\r\n\r\nIf the character has no known name but is still recognizable in images (or if their name is a [[spoilers|spoiler]]), a succinct description can be used as a tag for them. If there is consensus among how fans of the series refer to them, use that. If the tag may be ambiguous, add a _(series) or _(artist) qualifier for copyrighted and [[original]] characters respectively.\r\n\r\nCopyrighted examples:\r\n\r\n* [[idoko]]\r\n* [[idoko's_stepsister]]\r\n* [[giha_village_chief]]\r\n* [[nurse_(katawa_shoujo)]]\r\n* [[girl_with_bear_(madoka_magica)]]\r\n* [[lady_in_red_(ib)]]\r\n* [[mysterious_boy_(angel_beats!)]]\r\n* [[man_with_watch]]\r\n* [[kyon's sister]]\r\n* [[girl_from_the_illusionary_world]]\r\n* [[jyushimatsu's_girlfriend]]\r\n\r\n[[Original]] examples:\r\n\r\n* [[Red Girl (Yuuhagi (Amaretto-no-Natsu))]]\r\n* [[Black-haired Demon Girl (Shimmer)]]\r\n* [[Big Sister (navigavi)]]\r\n\r\nh6. Titles and honorifics\r\n\r\nGenerally, characters do not have honorifics or titles in their names, as the honorific changes depending on who is addressing the character. However, some characters have the honorific or title as a permanent part of their name such as [[Chouzetsusaikawa Tenshi-chan]] or [[Mr. C.B. (umamusume)|]] In these cases, keep the honorific or title intact. In cases where a character is frequently addressed by their title, a utility alias can be created to help find the character, such as the alias from Arthur Kirkland -> [[United Kingdom (Hetalia)]].\r\n\r\nh6. Alternate identities, [[genderswap]]s, and other derivatives\r\n\r\nIf a character has alternate identities or forms which are visually distinct, these are tagged as well. Use the official name, or if there is none, the agreed-upon fan referent.

The device adds a CD-ROM drive to the Mega Drive console, allowing the user to play CD-based games and providing additional hardware functionality. Other benefits of the add-on include a faster central processing unit and graphic enhancements. It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs. The main benefit of the new add-on's technology was its larger disc space, allowing for larger games to be developed. This would manifest itself in the form of full motion video (FMV) games.\r\n\r\nBy the end of [[1994]], the add-on had sold approximately 2.7 million units worldwide. In [[1995]], it was announced that Sega's support would shift away from the Mega Drive and Sega CD to focus on its new console, the [[Sega Saturn]], and the add-on itself was officially discontinued in [[1996]]. \r\n\r\nRetrospective reception to the add-on is mixed, praising the Sega CD for its individual offerings and additions to the Mega Drive's functions, but criticizing the game library as a whole for its lack of depth and low value for money, as well as issues with how the add-on was supported by Sega.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["メガCD"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":50831,"created_at":"2013-11-30T12:29:17.925-05:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T06:07:57.258-04:00","title":"hm_(hmongt)","body":"Artist.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232348,"created_at":"2025-03-19T05:26:59.458-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T05:26:59.458-04:00","title":"oosaki_erika","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エリカ・大崎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232347,"created_at":"2025-03-19T05:22:04.808-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T05:22:04.808-04:00","title":"sudou_itsuka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["須藤伊津花"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232345,"created_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:54.695-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:54.695-04:00","title":"lin_jingheng","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["林静恒"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232344,"created_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:43.175-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:53:43.175-04:00","title":"can_ci_pin","body":"novel","is_locked":false,"other_names":["残次品"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232323,"created_at":"2025-03-19T01:53:37.589-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:42:51.699-04:00","title":"string_bikini_panties","body":"Use either [[string panties]] or [[string bikini]] instead.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":166530,"created_at":"2023-06-09T00:04:30.531-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-19T04:31:03.638-04:00","title":"max_(shining_force)","body":"Protagonist of [[Shining Force 1]] and [[Shining Force 2]].
