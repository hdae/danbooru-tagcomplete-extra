When [[Akebono (kancolle)|]] is your secretary ship, she will occasionally call you クソ提督 (Kuso Teitoku, lit. \"Shitty Admiral\"). This \"hostility\" towards the admiral/player character stems from how she was treated in World War II. \r\n\r\nThis tag is only for the phrase itself. Do not use this tag when the [[admiral (kancolle)|Admiral]] is merely acting like a jerk. Use pool #8302 (\"Shitty Admiral\") instead.\r\n\r\nLike [[Kasumi (kancolle)|]], her sharp tongue is based upon her historical namesake being the victim of unfair treatment by the real-life admiral in charge. The captain of Akebono was unjustly scapegoated by the admiral for letting Shoukaku become damaged during the Battle of Coral Sea, even though there was little a destroyer could do about multiple waves of aircraft. She was reassigned to the rear after that, and never again had a prestigious post. Furthermore, on her next escort mission [i][[Albacore (Azur Lane)|USS Albacore]][/i] sank her sister-ship Sazanami. When Akebono went searching for USS Albacore, it delayed her so much the transports she was escorting were also destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Leyte Gulf/Surigao Strait, she was assigned to protect Mogami after a collision with Nachi caused by the admiral's hasty retreat. Mogami was then sunk by air attacks which Akebono was powerless to stop. Akebono was afterward tasked with protecting Nachi from further air attacks in Manila, which resulted in Nachi being destroyed by aircraft and Akebono being severely damaged. Akebono was towed to dock by Ushio, but further air raids destroyed Akebono in Manila Bay alongside [[Akishimo (Kancolle)|]]. Ultimately, Ushio was not only a survivor of the war, but her better war record got her improved anti-air defenses to protect against air raids, while Akebono languished.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クソ提督"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135511,"created_at":"2022-01-24T01:10:56.209-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-11T22:37:02.900-05:00","title":"ushio_kai_ni_(kancolle)","body":"The second remodel/kai ni of [i][[Kantai Collection]][/i]'s [[Ushio (Kancolle)|]]. \r\n\r\nUpon reaching kai ni, she gains a green-and-brown [[camouflage]] painted on her [[rigging]], boots and armaments, reflective of her final camo pattern when she was stationed in Yokosuka post-Leyte Gulf.

They will be separated between the two series as well. The names are derived from fan names listed on the \"Cardcaptor Sakura wiki\":https://ccsakura.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Clothes_and_Costumes, since the series does not attribute official names for them. These chartags exist to make it more practical to search for a particular costume. Each of their wikis will detail when each costume is worn in the anime or manga, and what occurs during each instance.\r\n\r\nNote that not every single one of Sakura's costumes are given chartags, particularly those only seen on manga covers.

Description\r\nh5. Base Art\r\n\r\nRanger has long reddish-[[pink hair]] and [[blue eyes]]. She wears a white [[tank top]] with reddish-[[pink skirt|pink]] [[pleated skirt|pleated]] [[miniskirt]] with a horizontal white stripe around it with \"RNGR\" on her left, a reference to her real-life pre-war identification marks. She has a [[black jacket]] with [[long sleeves|long]] [[detached sleeves]], and [[black thighhighs]]. In addition, she wears\r\n[[pink_gloves|pink]], [[partially fingerless gloves]], [[elbow gloves]] where the index finger is full covered, the middle finger is covered up to the first digit from the knuckle, and the ring and pinkie fingers are uncovered. She also has a [[headset]] with a [[microphone]] on her left side, a [[blue_bag|blue]] [[messenger bag]], and a [[choker]] with an [[anchor]] hanging from the front. She has very [[large breasts]] that sometimes get made bigger in what fanart she gets.\r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] is her ship model turned into a large [[crossbow]]-styled launcher. It is about 3/4 of her height, with a trigger about mid-ship on port-side. Her island superstructure is featured, alongside anti-air batteries, and a [[radar dish]]. She has a [[badge]] on her bag, which is her real life crew's badge.\r\n\r\nh5. Retrofit Art\r\n[tn]See post #2930385[/tn]\r\n\r\nIn her [[retrofit (azur lane)|]], her outfit gets swapped for white [[front-tie top]], a pair of [[uneven legwear|asymmetrical]] [[tight pants]] where the left leg is wrapped with black leather strips, and a jacket-esque [[cape]]. She sports a new [[flat cap]] with a white top and red beak, and some [[armored boots]].  Her already [[large breasts]] get more emphasize if not an actual increase.\r\n\r\nHer rigging loses the crossbow aesthetic and moves the trigger and handle aft.\r\n\r\nh5. Personality and In-game Trivia\r\nRanger takes on a role of a teacher, similar to [[Langley (Azur Lane)|]], treating the Commander as one of her students. She gets easily flustered, stuttering and getting embarrassed in several of her lines, with a number of things suggesting some desire for her students.\r\n\r\nHer plane loadout is purely dive bombers (like her real-life counterpart). Her skillset is particularly RNG dependent, leading to potentially hilarious damage output.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nIn real life, [i]Ranger[/i] was the US Navy's first carrier designed and built from scratch, providing valuable training experience to Naval aviators for the likelihood of war. In World War II, she primarily saw combat in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters as her comparatively slow speed, minimal armor, and limited plane capacity prevented her from seeing service in the Pacific other than training duties from 1944 onward. She was decommissioned in 1946 and sold for scrap a year later.\r\n\r\nh4. Skins\r\n* !post #2930382: Default\r\n* !post #2930385: [[ranger_(retrofit)_(azur_lane)|Retrofit]]\r\n\r\nh4.

It is considered a result of the outcome of [[World War I]].\r\n\r\nThe belligerents formed two major factions, the Allied Powers (or \"Allies\") and the Axis Powers (or \"Axis\").\r\n\r\nWorld War II is considered the deadliest military conflict in human history. Over 60 million people died as a result of the fighting and/or resulting resource shortages, as well as deliberate mass killings throughout the war, and hundreds of millions were displaced or left destitute in the aftermath. WW2 can also be considered the deathblow to the old European empires which had dominated history up to that point; the war left them financially, militarily, and culturally even more exhausted than they had been after WW1 and saw the rise of two new super-powers with a rather anti-colonial bent to them: the [[soviet|USSR]] and the [[united states|USA]], thus kickstarting the [[Cold War]].\r\n\r\nTechnologically, WW2 saw the first usage of the many trends that still dominate warfare to this day: the first modern [[missile]]s and [[rocket]]s were used during WW2, [[aircraft carrier]]s replaced [[battleship]]s as the dominant surface warfare vessels, unmanned radio controlled vehicles saw limited use during the war, and [[StG 44]], the world's first assault rifle, entered service during the later half of the war. The most important and influential technology used, however, is the first (and only) usage of a [[nuclear weapon]] in the history of warfare: [[atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki|when the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by the atomic bombs dropped by the USA]].\r\n\r\nThis tag can be applied if the image is related to World War 2, such as featuring technology (tanks, aircraft, warships or weapons) of the era, uniforms & troops, or battle scenes.\r\n\r\nh4.

A [[terrorism|terrorist attack]] involving two planes hijacked by Al-Qaeda [[terrorist]]s flew into the [[World Trade Center|Twin Towers]], causing them to collapse top-down onto the streets of [[New York City]]. Another plane was flown into the Pentagon building in Arlington, Virginia while a fourth, presumed to be targeting somewhere in [[Washington D.C.]] was deliberately crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania as its passengers fought to regain control from the terrorists. The death toll is currently at 2,996, including 17 hijackers.\r\n\r\nThe event is widely considered by Americans to be the true start of the 2000s, as well as a catalyst of the \"War on Terror\", a series of armed involvement of the US and allies in the middle east under the pretext of eliminating terrorism. Chief among these conflicts were as the [[War in Afghanistan|American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq in 2003]], and to an extent, the [[Syrian Civil War]].\r\n\r\nDue to various factors, the event has spawned numerous jokes and [[meme]]s. The earliest was about various conspiracy theory alleged that the event was an inside job orchestrated by then-US President [[george w. bush|George W. Bush]] as a [i]casus belli[/i] for the war in the middle east, such as \"Bush did 9/11\" and \"jet fuel don't melt steel beams\". Though later on, 9/11 imagery or reference has gained resurgence as a part of Gen Z humor, primarily for the shock value or as an \"edgy\" punchline.\r\n\r\nThe most common depiction of the event depicts [[smoke]] exiting either of the towers.\r\n\r\nh4.

The exoskeleton that covers Piranimon’s head enhances the power of its jaws, helping it to crush foes with its sharp fangs.

Then it clamps down on them with its bite and rapidly spins around with Calamity Vise, riddling their body with holes as it finishes them off. Since Piranimon target lone Digimon and attack in groups, they leave behind no trace of their prey’s data.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ピラニモン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":221230,"created_at":"2025-01-08T01:14:16.386-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-08T01:14:16.386-05:00","title":"reikarts","body":"[[AI generated|AI]] prompter.
