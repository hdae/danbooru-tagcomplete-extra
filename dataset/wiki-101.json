Several types of war fans were used by the samurai class of feudal Japan and each had a different look and purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of war fan:\r\n\r\nGunsen (軍扇) were folding fans used by the average warriors to cool themselves off. They were made of wood, bronze, brass or a similar metal for the inner spokes, and often used thin iron or other metals for the outer spokes or cover, making them lightweight but strong. Warriors would hang their fans from a variety of places, most typically from the belt or the breastplate, though the latter often impeded the use of a sword or a bow. Example: post #2540638\r\n\r\n[[Tessen]] (鉄扇) were folding fans with outer spokes made of heavy plates of iron which were designed to look like normal, harmless folding fans or solid clubs shaped to look like a closed fan. Samurai could take these to places where swords or other overt weapons were not allowed, and some swordsmanship schools included training in the use of the tessen as a weapon. The tessen was also used for fending off knives and darts, as a throwing weapon, and as an aid in swimming. Example: post #1904493\r\n\r\n[[Gunbai]] (Gumbai), Gunpai (Gumpai) or dansen uchiwa (軍配) were large solid open fans that could be solid iron, metal with wooden core, or solid wood, which were carried by high-ranking officers. They were used to ward off arrows, as a sunshade, and to signal to troops. Also used by scoring referees in sumo wrestling matches.

First introduced in the PC RTS game [[Dawn of War]], the chapter have since appeared in both the tabletop and other 40k games as well. The chapter is known from their red armor and their emblem, a raven with a blood drop on its chest.\r\n\r\nWhile generally well received amongst (most of) the Imperium for their protective nature over civilians and eagerness to deal death to the enemies of the Imperium, the Techpriests of Mars and the Inquisition due to their voracious appetite for knowledge, learning and artifacts in particular, the Blood Ravens have a mixed reputation amongst the other Space Marine chapters due to both their strategies (favoring extensive recon, meticulous planning and pinpoint assaults on key enemy vulnerabilities) and their Chapter-wide tendency to produce almost unprecedented numbers of psykers and Librarians. The Space Wolves (who favor strategies involving charges and overwhelming the foe in massed melee) infamously do not tolerate Blood Raven procedures at all, with physical altercations being recorded between the two chapters at command-level meetings.\r\n\r\nAs a second-founding chapter with no official records prior to M37K, the Blood Ravens do not (again officially) have a recognizable Primarch. However, their color scheme, tendency to produce psykers and culture surrounding the acquisition of knowledge strongly suggest that they are descendants of [[Magnus the Red]], making them loyalists of the [[Thousand Sons]] traitor legion. This would also make them an indirect relative chapter of the [[Grey Knight]]s due to sharing a Founder in Janus.\r\n\r\nAs the Blood Raven arsenal contains some phenomenally unlikely artifacts (Gear belonging to the Custodes and [i]Primarchs[/i] to name but a few) that would have been under enough security to make their theft near impossible, the Blood Ravens gained the fandom reputation of being able to perform implausible acts of indefinite borrowing, such as swapping places with a Land Raider's driver while he's still inside the cockpit, acquiring Bjorn the Fell-handed's Dreadnaught for combat use (with Bjorn catching on quickly to his new circumstances and happily embracing the chance to go back to war) and involuntarily renting the Golden Throne of Terra. \r\n\r\nThe chapter have been jokingly called \"The Bloody Magpies\" by fans due to how the chapter are constantly gifted (or 'gifted', due to those same chapters not having any records stating that they ever gave the Ravens anything)  rare, powerful weapons and gear from other older chapters.  \r\nDue to their memetic shenanigans, gateway status to the 40k world and generally being a interesting chapter, the Blood Ravens are well-regarded amongst the fandom - even if the jokes about rampant theft get a little repetitive.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174176,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:37.940-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:37.940-04:00","title":"hiraga_raizou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["平賀雷蔵"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174175,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:13.627-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:43:13.627-04:00","title":"suzukaze_miharu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["涼風美晴"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":174174,"created_at":"2023-10-07T13:42:52.208-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T13:42:52.208-04:00","title":"candy_&_cigarettes","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キャンディ&シガレッツ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":148110,"created_at":"2022-08-06T18:58:17.855-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-07T12:18:33.479-04:00","title":"ariel_(yu-gi-oh!)","body":"An umbrella tag for variations of the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] [[duel monster]] Gishki Ariel who was originally printed in 2011 and has received new forms throughout the years. \r\n\r\nh4.

It's stated somewhere that you also become a Prinny if you lead a meaningless life.\r\n\r\nPrinnies slur the words at the end of their sentences as \"~ッス\", or in English localizations, say \"dood\" at the end of sentence, dood.\r\n\r\n[[Kazamatsuri Fuuka]] is a notable \"prinny\" from Disgaea 4 who wasn't fully converted into a prinny, and instead looks and acts as a girl with a prinny hat on and doesn't explode, in spite of her technical prinny status.  Other characters who die in Disgaea frequently reappear as prinnies, including some bad endings, but they are [[spoilers]]. \r\n\r\nThere are some Prinnies who break the usual standards of being one, though those instances tend to be rare. [[Big Sis Prinny (disgaea)|]] is the first to break tradition by having a woman's voice. Another is the giant yellow Prinny that [[Usalia (disgaea)|]] rides around on during battles, which doesn’t have a name and never speaks.
