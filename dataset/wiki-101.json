It is piloted by [[Banagher Links]].\r\n\r\nThe Full Armor Mode was an enhancement plan devised by [[Irei Takuya]] while aboard the Nahel Argama and is based on Takuya's extensive knowledge of mobile suits. After Banagher's Newtype potential manifests itself, the [[Psycho Frame]] changes color to a vibrant green. Unlike other mobile suits with the Full Armor designation, the FA Unicorn does not consist of any additional armor for the MS frame itself (except extra [[shield|shields]]). However it does introduce a large array of weapons, which are added to the legs, backpack and forearms.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, what appears to be a haphazard collection of weaponry is actually a superbly balanced set-up which draws out the maximum combat potential of the Unicorn. The new array of weapons includes two backpack-mounted hyper bazookas, numerous hand grenades and grenade launchers, missile pods, forearm-mounted Gatling guns, and two additional I-field-equipped shields, one on the backpack and the other on the right forearm. The backpack also features two massive vernier-boosters taken from a [[base_jabber|Base Jabber Type 94]] to compensate for the increased mass, with one of the additional shields situated between them. The unit's entire weapons load can be disconnected at any time if the ammunitions are completely spent to avoid becoming dead-weight. Like the normal Unicorn, the Full Armor Unicorn can take control of an enemy's psycommu weapons, even Quasi-Psycommu bits, when the [[NT-D]] is activated.\r\n\r\nJust like the original Unicorn, its Full Armor version is designed in real life by [[Katoki Hajime]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":47453,"created_at":"2013-07-14T21:07:23.600-04:00","updated_at":"2023-04-07T22:58:16.877-04:00","title":"fin_funnels","body":"A form of remote weapon unique to the [[Nu Gundam]]/[[Hi-Nu Gundam]] (and retroactively, its testbed unit, the [[Delta Gundam Kai]]). Despite their name, the fin funnels equipped on Nu Gundam/Hi-Nu Gundam are in function \"[[bit (gundam)|bits]]\", since they have built-in generators rather than the E-caps used by [[funnels (gundam)|]]. While this made them much more expensive to construct, and allowed less modules to be equipped than the standard, this had the enormous benefit of giving the fin funnels a tremendously long operational time. Circling the battlefield on their own, the fin funnels could be utilized in far more creative and strategic ways than standard funnels.\r\n\r\nThe actual beam fired by the fin funnels was also more powerful, given that they are emitted by a generator instead of an E-cap, allowing for better performance compared to Zeon's funnels. The fin funnels also had the ability to generate a unique beam shield, known as a \"fin funnel barrier\", to provide a defense against both beam weaponry and solid projectiles with lower outputs compared to the beam shield's power consumption. Although these unique funnels proved incredibly effective and flexible in purpose, they were also much larger than the standard funnel, making them easier targets to shoot down. With the help of the [[Psycho Frame]] technology, Nu Gundam/Hi-Nu Gundam pilot [[Amuro Ray]] can utilize these fin funnels more effectively by thoughts alone.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the Hi-Nu Gundam is capable of recharging and refueling its fin funnels, thanks to the upgrades on its backpack.\r\n\r\nThis tag can also refer to fin-shaped remote weapons or those that physically resemble the Nu Gundam/Hi-Nu Gundam's fin funnels.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フィン・ファンネル","フィンファンネル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":32891,"created_at":"2012-02-25T20:45:03.568-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-07T22:57:03.970-04:00","title":"hi-nu_gundam","body":"Japanese: Hi-νガンダム\r\n\r\nThe alternate interpretation of the [[Nu Gundam]] featured in  [[char's_counterattack_-_beltorchika's_children|Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack - Beltorchika's Children]].\r\n\r\nIn addition to a more bulky design, the RX-93-ν2 Hi-Nu Gundam sports an exclusively white and purple (or blue) color scheme to distinguish it from the white and black (or midnight blue) paint job on the RX-93 Nu Gundam. Like the Nu Gundam, the Hi-Nu Gundam also has a mouthpiece with three vents. \r\n\r\nThe most prolific difference, however, is its distinct back boosters and revised [[fin funnels|fin funnel]] system. The fairly standard backpack design of the Nu Gundam is replaced with a much more unique dual \"long booster\" system, with another long booster situated between them and two propellant tanks angled below the dual long boosters. These boosters were capable of great accelerations, and the propellant tanks extended the duration of time the boosters could remain active. The long boosters also served as the storage area for the unit's fin funnels. Also, unlike the Nu Gundam, the Hi-Nu Gundam could recharge the fin funnel's power supply, extending their performance time.\r\n\r\nApart from the obvious visual differences, the Hi-Nu Gundam also expands on the Nu Gundam's armaments, with the addition of a powerful [[machine gun]] in its right forearm as well as the inclusion of an extra [[energy sword|beam saber]], bringing the number of beam sabers up to three. The suit can also use a Hyper Mega Bazooka Launcher, an improved model of the weapon used by the [[Hyaku Shiki]] during the [[zeta gundam|Gryps Conflict]], when heavier firepower is required.\r\n\r\nThanks to its [[Psycho Frame]], a vast improvement over the psycommu system prevalent among mobile suits designed to be used by Newtype pilots, the Hi-Nu Gundam's pilot had much greater control over the mobile suit, piloting it almost as if it were an extension of his own body and bringing out the suit's fullest performance.\r\n\r\nIt is piloted and designed in-universe by [[Amuro Ray]].

Haruka becomes acquainted with six of her classmates, who are all competing to become idols. For her project, she must team up with another student as an idol-producer team, and if they are successful, they will join Shining Agency after graduation.  \r\n\r\nThe franchise features three idol groups: the main group [[STARISH|ST★RISH]], [[QUARTET NIGHT]] - a band made up of the seniors of ST★RISH in the 2013 game [i]Uta no Prince-sama: All Star[/i], and HE★VENS - an anime-only idol group introduced in [[uta_no_prince-sama_maji_love_2000_percent|Uta no Prince-sama: Maji Love 2000%]] and not seen before in the games who become rivals to ST★RISH\r\n\r\nh4.
