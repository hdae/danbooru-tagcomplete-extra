Heavily disliked by the most fanatical Nazi officials, he never rose through the ranks more than commander because of an incident where Knispel defended a [[Soviet Army]] P.O.W. after seeing him being beaten by a [[Waffen-SS]] [[soldier]]. Kurt pointed his sidearm at the SS guard and forced him to stop. Knispel was also usually seen [[beard]]ed, hairy and umkept, what went against regulations. The look of the character [[Sergeant Oddball]] from [[Kelly's Heroes]] was actually based on Knispel.\r\n\r\nKnispel was severely wounded on 28 April 1945 by shrapnel to his head when his [[Tiger II]] was hit during battle with [[Soviet]] tanks in the Eastern Front.

The series is notable for it's unique [[retro artstyle]] and thoroughly accurate depictions of the multitude of [[video game]] software, hardware, and even culture from that era. The title of the manga is a pun on the term \"High School Girl\".\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 2014, Osaka District Police searched the offices of [[Square Enix]], the publishers of the manga, acting on an IP violation claim by [[SNK]] Playmore stating that the comic allegedly features over 100 instances of characters from [[The King of Fighters]], [[Samurai Spirits]], and other fighting games. In response, Square Enix voluntarily recalled all printed volumes and temporarily suspended publication of future volumes and digital sales (and put the anime on hold). However, the manga continued its run in [i]Monthly Big Gangan[/i] only.\r\n\r\nIn August 2015 it was reported that Square Enix and SNK Playmore had finally reached a settlement, cancelling the lawsuit and enabling the manga to be sold everywhere (and the anime produced) once again. \r\n\r\nThe weekly official anime adaptation was finally released in 2018 with twelve 24 min. episodes. In 2019, Extra Stage OVA and season 2 were released. All 24 episodes were made by Studio J.C.Staff and available on Netflix.\r\n\r\nThe original manga series ended in 2018. In 2019 it was followed by [i]High Score Girl Dash[/i], a spinoff sequel that focuses on [[Hidaka Koharu]], now a middle school teacher.\r\n\r\nh4.

The dynasty was officially proclaimed in 1636 in Mukden (modern-day Shenyang), and following the Battle of Shanhai Pass it seized control of [[Beijing]] in 1644, which is often considered the start of the dynasty's rule in China. Within decades the Qing had consolidated its control over the whole of China proper and [[Taiwan]], and by the mid-18th century it had expanded its rule into Inner Asia. \r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century to the early 20th century, the Qing suffered from numerous defeat and setback as a result of intervention from various European colonial powers (primarily the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Russian Empire]]) and later with the recently modernized [[Japan|Empire of Japan]], which resulted into a power struggle between the reformist and reactionary. This, combined with surge in anti-Manchu dissent among the Han Chinese, resulted into the downfall of the dynasty when it was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution in 1912.\r\n\r\nIn Chinese historiography, the Qing dynasty was preceded by the [[Ming dynasty]] and succeeded by the [[Kuomintang|Republic of China]]. The multiethnic Qing dynasty assembled the territorial base for [[China|modern China]]. During its peak, it was the largest imperial dynasty in the history of China and in 1790 the fourth-largest empire in world history in terms of territorial size. With 419,264,000 citizens in 1907, it was the most populous country in the world at the time.\r\n\r\nh4.

Unlike the Zoloat which was designed for [[space]] combat, the Zolo is designed for combat on Earth, both on the ground and in the air. \r\n\r\nFor that purpose, its thrusters and systems have been optimized for use under gravity and in the atmosphere allowing limited flight. The Zolo is also the first mass-produced mobile suit to utilize the beam rotor which is mounted on a hardpoint on either the left or right arm or a back-mounted hardpoint. First tested on the ZMT-S06G [[Zolorotor]], the beam rotor allows for more fuel efficient flight, and in mobile suit mode, doubles as a beam shield or a beam saw that can cut through any enemy mobile suits.\r\n\r\nOne of the Zolo's most significant features is its transformation system. Its torso can disconnect from the legs at the waist and transform into a helicopter/jet hybrid vehicle known as a Top Terminal. The waist and legs of the mobile suit become a Bottom Terminal that is remote controlled from the Top Terminal and relies on jet thrusters for propulsion. It can be outfitted with an anti-ground depth charge container to accompany the Top Terminal in bombing runs, and other missions that require dealing large amounts of damage to ground targets.\r\n\r\nIt was succeeded by the [[tomliat_(mecha)|Tomliat]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ZM-S08G","ZM-S08Gゾロ","ゾロ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":176938,"created_at":"2023-11-12T01:09:00.180-05:00","updated_at":"2024-06-30T20:33:56.077-04:00","title":"tomliat_(mecha)","body":"A fictional variable geometry [[mecha]] from the [[Gundam]] series.
