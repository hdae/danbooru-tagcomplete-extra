Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies.

These designs became more complex as aircraft speeds increased to Mach 3.0 and Mach 3.2, design points for the XB-70 and SR-71 respectively. The inlet is part of the fuselage or part of the nacelle.\r\n\r\nAircraft with a maximum speed greater than about Mach 2 use intakes with variable geometry to achieve good pressure recovery from take-off to maximum speed.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is currently available exclusively in Japanese, though it has started to introduce some English-language graphical assets, and accessing the game for non-Japanese players requiring unconventional means.\r\n\r\nh4. Gameplay\r\n\r\nGameplay is centered upon building squadrons composed of individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. The player takes on the role of an [[Admiral (kancolle)|]] (提督 [i]teitoku[/i]) and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing.\r\n\r\nEach of the characters are moe [[personification]]s of [[World War II]] naval [[warship]]s, which are depicted as cute girls known as \"ship girls\" (艦娘, [i]kanmusu[/i]). These personified warships are based on real life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real life vessel.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the roster of the shipgirls was designed to be limited to the IJN and major players of the Imperial Japanese Army, and its final mission being an attack on the base, akin to how World War 2 played out for Japan. Due to the game's popularity, it has since introduced shipgirls from other Axis nations and wartime rival factions, including ships from the U.S. Navy, the British Royal Navy and even the somewhat-neutral Swedish Navy. \r\n\r\nAs of early 2022, KanColle features ships from following navies: Imperial Japanese Navy, Imperial Japanese Army, Maritime Safety Agency/Japan Coast Guard, United States Navy, British Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Dutch Koninklijke Marine, French Marine nationale, Italian Regia Marina, German Kriegsmarine, Военно-морской флот СССР, Swedish Svenska marinen, and Republic of China Navy. With the most numerous non-Japanese navies being United States Navy and Regia Marina.\r\n\r\nh4. Media\r\n\r\nThe game has developed into a much larger media franchise; various media including multiple manga series and light novels have been released, in addition to an officially licensed [[tabletop rpg|tabletop role-playing game]]. A [[PlayStation Vita]] game was released February 2016. A [[Kantai Collection (anime)|television anime adaptation]] aired Winter 2015, with a sequel season airing in 2022, and an anime movie was released in 2016. There is also a Japan only 3D arcade game [[Kancolle Arcade]] that was released in 2016.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe web browser game was launched on April 23, 2013, originally designed to run in Adobe Flash. An Android app version was released on August 1st, 2016. As of January 2015, the game had 2.5 million registered players. The game migrated to HTML5 prior to worldwide decommissioning of Adobe Flash in browsers.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging\r\n\r\nDon't tag shipgirls with [[mecha musume]], [[personification]],  [[World War II]], or [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], unless these things are present outside of the shipgirls themselves.\r\n\r\nDon't tag shipgirls of the same class as [[sisters]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Of note, they are sometimes worn under a wetsuit or [[diving suit]] for added comfort.\r\n\r\nBecause rash guards are made from [[tight clothes]]-fitting materials like spandex, nylon, polyester, or neoprene and are often sold as matching top/bottom sets, this can sometimes make them appear similar to a [[wetsuit]] or [[one-piece swimsuit]] at a glance when no midriff is visible.
