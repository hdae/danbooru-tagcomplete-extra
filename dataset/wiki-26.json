Though she is respectful of her brother and defends his misconduct, he is in turn an abusive jerk towards her.

It was produced and distributed by Esperanto Films.\r\n\r\nPan's Labyrinth takes place in [[Spain]] in May–June 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative of the film interweaves this real world with a mythical world centered around an overgrown abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with which the main character, [[Ofelia]], interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist [[Captain Vidal]], hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, Animatronics and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures.\r\n\r\nDel Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film [i]The Devil's Backbone[/i] (2001), to which Pan's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's commentary on the DVD. The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English, German, and French titles refer specifically to the faun-like Greek character Pan. However, del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.\r\n\r\nThe film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2006. In the United States and Canada, the film was given a limited release on December 29, 2006, with a wide release on January 19, 2007. Pan's Labyrinth opened to widespread critical acclaim. The film won numerous international awards, including three Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards including Best Film Not in the English Language, the Ariel Award for Best Picture, the Saturn Awards for Best International Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Ivana Baquero and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["パンズ・ラビリンス","パンズラビリンス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":188922,"created_at":"2024-04-04T13:05:01.011-04:00","updated_at":"2025-07-01T21:24:12.395-04:00","title":"retaining_wall","body":"A [[wall]] built to keep the soil behind it from sliding.

Heinlein\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein], first published (in abridged form) as a serial in [i]The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction[/i] (October, November 1959, as \"Starship Soldier\") and published hardcover in December, 1959.\r\n\r\nThe first-person narrative is about a young human soldier of [[philippines|Filipino]] ethnicity named [[johnny_rico|Juan \"Johnnie\" Rico]] and his exploits in the [[Mobile Infantry]], a futuristic [[military]] unit of [[space marine]]s  equipped with [[power armor]]s and involved in an interstellar war between mankind and an [[arachnid_(starship_troopers)|arachnid]] [[alien]] species known as \"the [[Bug]]s\".\r\n\r\nThis book is notable because it was one of the first works of science fiction that introduced the concept of [[power suit]]s. It influenced many sci-fi anime creators and helped to create the [b]Real Robot[/b] genre of piloted [[mecha]] (The creators of [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] from 1979 have cited Starship Troopers as an important inspiration).\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual produced a 6 episode Japanese OVA adaptation locally titled [[Uchuu No Senshi]].\r\n\r\nThe most famous and well known adaptation of the book is the 1997 movie adaptation directed by Paul Verhoeven and staring Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and Neil Patrick Harris. The movie has a mixed reception: some criticized Verhoeven as he never fully read the book and viewed its themes of militarism and patriotism as resembling [[fascist]] rhetoric, which influenced the movie's portrayal of the human government; others have praised it as a prescient satire of nationalism and military propaganda.\r\n\r\nh4.

However, after Japan's surrender, the third bomb was never assembled, and the core was later used for experiments at Los Alamos Laboratory, USA.\r\n\r\nThe core would later gain the name \"Demon core\" after two separate criticality accidents, each of which killed one scientist. The second incident involved Louis Slotin, a Canadian-American physicist, using a [[screwdriver]] to control the separation of two metallic half spheres (neutron reflectors) around the core. Upon the screwdriver slipping out, the half spheres closed completely and the assembly immediately became supercritical, releasing a burst of [[radiation]], more specifically [[Cherenkov radiation]]. This procedure specifically has became a subject of several minor memes in the Japanese community, usually to suggest a character is habitually oblivious or reckless.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, a [[meme]] revolving around the Demon Core suddenly became popular outside of Japan, possibly due to \"Kyle Hill's\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFlromB6SnU] and \"Plainly Difficult's\":[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE8FnsnWz48] videos covering the object.

A gaiden game, [i][[gunvolt chronicles luminous avenger ix|Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX]][/i], later follows after the events of [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt 1[/i] and focuses on Copen. There are also supplementary materials that expands on the serie's world and characters, such as [i]Azure Striker Gunvolt: Fleeting Memories[/i], prequel story taking place before the first game, as well as an OVA based on the first game released through the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

It is considered a result of the outcome of [[World War I]].\r\n\r\nThe belligerents formed two major factions, the Allied Powers (or \"Allies\") and the Axis Powers (or \"Axis\").\r\n\r\n[b]World War II is considered the deadliest military conflict in human history[/b]. Over 60 million people died as a result of the fighting and/or resulting resource shortages, as well as deliberate mass killings throughout the war, and hundreds of millions were displaced or left destitute in the aftermath. WW2 can also be considered the deathblow to the old European empires which had dominated history up to that point; the war left them financially, militarily, and culturally even more exhausted than they had been after WW1 and saw the rise of two new super-powers with a rather anti-colonial bent to them: the [[soviet|USSR]] and the [[united states|USA]], thus kickstarting the [[Cold War]].\r\n\r\nTechnologically, WW2 saw the first usage of the many trends that still dominate warfare to this day: the first modern [[missile]]s and [[rocket]]s were used during WW2, [[aircraft carrier]]s replaced [[battleship]]s as the dominant surface warfare vessels, unmanned radio controlled vehicles saw limited use during the war, and [[StG 44]], the world's first assault rifle, entered service during the later half of the war. The most important and influential technology used, however, is the first (and only) usage of a [[nuclear weapon]] in the history of warfare: [[atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki|when the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by the atomic bombs dropped by the USA]].\r\n\r\nThis tag can be applied if the image is related to World War 2, such as featuring technology (tanks, aircraft, warships or weapons) of the era, uniforms & troops, or battle scenes.\r\n\r\nh4.

Its other unique aspect was its chain scoring system where by destroying three enemies of the same color will result in a \"Chain Bonus\" that accumulates as the player chain the same-colored enemies in succession.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most sought-after Sega Saturn games around; it was never released outside Japan unfortunately, and import copies of the game can fetch around high prices at auction sites due to its rarity and legacy. Thankfully, in 2011, it saw an enhanced re-release on [[xbox_360|Xbox 360]] for 1,200 Microsoft Points ($15 U.S. Dollars) via Xbox LIVE Arcade, with optional HD graphics, English translated subtitles, and online multi-player.\r\n\r\nh4.
