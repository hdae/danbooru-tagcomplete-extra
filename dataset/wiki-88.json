She was originally planned to be the third \"[i]Yamato[/i]-class battleship\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato-class_battleship, but after the loss of the aircraft carriers \"[i]Akagi[/i]\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Akagi, \"[i]Kaga[/i]\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Kaga, \"[i]Hiryuu[/i]\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiryū, and \"[i]Souryuu[/i]\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Sōryū after the [[Battle of Midway]] she was converted into a supercarrier as her hull was partially incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn theory, [i]Shinano[/i] was capable of fielding the largest airwing of any aircraft carrier constructed by the end of World War II and was kept secret as she was meant to be a strategic surprise. However, due to the advanced state of her construction as a battleship before conversion, [i]Shinano[/i] has a dispropotionally small hangar size of 47 aircrafts (in comparison, the light aircraft carrier [[Ryuujou (kancolle)|]] accommodated 48 aircrafts despite her displacement is almost 7 times less than that of Shinano's). Due to this, the IJN planned to use [i]Shinano[/i] as a support carrier to tend the other fleet carrier's air wings.\r\n\r\n[i]Shinano[/i] was launched October 8, 1944 (originally planned to launced May 1945, but her construction was expedited due to the \"Battle of the Philippine Sea\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea)]) and commissioned November 19, 1944. [i]Shinano[/i] was dispatched from Yokosuka to Kure with an inexperienced crew to finish her fitting out and embark her aircraft, but she was sunk en-route by  \"[i]USS Archerfish[/i]\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Archerfish_%28SS-311%29 on November 29, 1944. [i]Shinano[/i] was the the largest warship ever sunken by a submarine.\r\n\r\n[i]Shinano[/i] was named after the old \"Shinano Province\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinano_Province], now modern day \"Nagano Prefecture\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagano_Prefecture].\r\n\r\nh4.

He directed the anime film [[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]] in 1984, when he was only 24 years old.\r\n\r\nKawamori attended Keio University in the same years as Macross screenwriter Ōnogi Hiroshi and character designer [[Mikimoto Haruhiko]] (where they had a [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] fanclub called \"Gunsight-1\"). He occasionally used the alias 黒河影次 Kurokawa Eiji early in his career when he started as a member of Studio Nue. \r\n\r\nKawamori Shouji is also an accomplished visual artist and [[mecha]] designer. Some of his early anime works include designs for [[Techno Police 21C]], [[Ulysses 31]] and [[Crusher Joe]]. He may be best known as the designer of the legendary [[VF-1]] [b]Valkyrie[/b] from [[MACROSS]] and the original [b]Convoy[/b] ([[Optimus Prime]]) toy for [[Transformers]]. \r\n\r\nEach and every variable fighter from the Macross series (except those from [[Macross 2]]) was created by him. \r\n\r\nThese and other designs have established Kawamori as a (perhaps the) master of transforming mecha. He’s also known for designing the [[Gundam GP-01 Zephyranthes]] and the [[Gundam GP-02 Physalis]] from [[Gundam 0083]]. Kawamori has also created designs for videogames like [[Choukou Senki Kikaiou]] ([[Rafaga]]) and the [[Armored Core]] series. He still works with Studio Nue on certain projects. The majority of his designs are sleek and aerodynamic although he’s quite versatile – many people have trouble identifying Kawamori designs. He is sought after as a mecha designer and has worked on a large variety of projects and continues to produce and direct anime TV series and OVA’s.\r\n\r\nKawamori is currently executive director at the animation studio Satelight. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, ecological concern... and lots of music idols. \r\n\r\nh4.
