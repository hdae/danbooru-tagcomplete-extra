The 82-day battle lasted from 1 April until 22 June 1945. After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, 340 mi (550 km) away.\r\n\r\nThe battle has been referred to as the \"typhoon of steel\" in English, of which the Japanese original phrase was \"tetsu no bōfū\". The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of Japanese kamikaze attacks and the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle was the bloodiest in the Pacific, with around 50,000 Allied and 84,166–117,000 Japanese casualties,  including Okinawans conscripted into the Japanese Army. According to local authorities, at least 149,425 Okinawan people were killed, died by coerced suicide or went missing.\r\n\r\nIn [[operation_ten-gou|the naval operations surrounding the battle]], both sides lost considerable numbers of [[ship]]s and [[aircraft]], including the [[yamato_(battleship)|Japanese battleship Yamato]]. \r\n\r\nAfter the American [[victory]] in the battle, which was very costly (50,000 U.S. soldier casualties, includeed 12,500 killed and missing as well as 36,122 wounded), Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan for US forces in preparation for \"the invasion of the Japanese home islands\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall.\r\n\r\nThe high number of U.S. casualties in this battle was one of the reasons for their [[Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] to end [[the Pacific]] war.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["沖縄戦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":19441,"created_at":"2010-06-03T21:37:20.523-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T21:52:23.673-04:00","title":"yuuichi_(tareme_paradise)","body":"Artist who was active on \"NIFTY SERVE\":http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%95%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96 (a now-defunct Japanese commercial online service provider).

Aside from post #3731497 (shared February 2016 during [[Girls' Frontline]]'s third beta), [[lowlight kirilenko|Hai Mao]] had drawn her with [[M4 SOPMOD II (girls' frontline)|]] on \"a signboard\":[https://zh.moegirl.org/File:%E6%B5%B7%E7%8C%AB%E7%BB%9C%E5%90%88%E7%89%A9%E7%9A%84W%E7%AD%BE%E7%BB%98.jpg] for a fan of the latter, around 2016 whilst they were selling a new doujin book (to the curiosity of the fan who'd later share the art on Weibo). With the design resemblance, and already designating her with the name W, players have thus decided to refer to this version of her as such too.\r\n\r\nDesign-wise, just as with Arknights' W, she appears to have white/silver hair along with dark red accents, though more akin to SOPMOD and less like antennae. Though both having bandanas or scarfs, in place of red horns, she wears a headset. Uniquely to her, she appears to have a mole under her left eye, and appears to have a walkie-talkie on her left shoulder. On the signboard, she also has hands like those SOPMOD has. \r\n\r\nThough the association with SOPMOD has brought some speculation as to what her weapon may have been, it is most commonly thought to be the one that Arknights' W is seen with, a Mk18 Mod0 (derived from the SOPMOD accessory system for the [[M4 Carbine]]); otherwise known as the CQBR or CQBW (CQB Weapon), with some proponents of this theory speculating the \"W\" in her name to derive from the latter, bolstered by the fact that Arknights' W has \"CQBW\" as her in-game codename. In 2024, Girls' Frontline finally added [[mk.18 (girls' frontline)|a character]] representing the Mk18 Mod0.\r\n\r\nFollowing Hai Mao's departure from MICA Team in 2017, and the formation of HyperGryph, it is probable that Hai Mao recycled the design for Arknights, alongside other elements they contributed that didn't make the cut for Girls' Frontline (such as the proto-Doctor design found with proto-W, or their proposed draft for the early chapters prior to Jano [热运动] rewriting it, involving an amnesiac Commander awaking in the middle of combat against an abstractly and fantastically strong Sangvis Ferri).","is_locked":false,"other_names":["W(少女前線)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208234,"created_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:44.410-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:44.410-04:00","title":"multicolored_crown","body":"A [[crown]] that is multiple colors.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208233,"created_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:08.146-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T18:33:08.146-04:00","title":"orange_crown","body":"A [[crown]] that is colored orange.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":208232,"created_at":"2024-09-14T18:32:58.197-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-14T18:32:58.197-04:00","title":"xm556_(girls'_frontline)","body":"An android representing the [[XM556]] in [[Girls' Frontline]].\r\n\r\nh4.

She represents the [[Sega Dreamcast]].\r\n\r\n[Spoiler] Originally she was Planeptune's CPU, but because of her power to make dreams come true, Gamindustri began to hate her and had to be sealed away, she ended up creating the Uranus CPU so that she would be forgotten in history. Due to the hatred, her Share Energy became Negative Energy, creating her other part called [[Ankokuboshi Kurome]]. [/Spoiler]\r\n\r\nUzume's first name refers to the Japanese goddess of dawn, mirth and revelry, Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto (天鈿女命). Her tough attitude may be a reference to the Kogo Shui (古語拾遺)'s interpretation of \"Uzume\" (鈿女) as \"Woman of Strength\". Uzume's last name, Tennouboshi (天王星, lit. Heaven King Star), the Japanese name for the planet Uranus, is a reference to Sega Uranus; a possibly unused Sega console codename.\r\n\r\nOrange Heart's name is inspired by the orange swirl on the Sega Dreamcast.\r\n\r\n\"Uzu\" is Japanese for \"whirlpool\" or \"swirl\", referencing the Dreamcast symbol.\r\n\r\nVoiced by: [[Honda Mariko]] (Japanese), Erica Lindbeck (English)\r\n\r\nh4.

It's intended to provide a written description of the image for blind users, but normally it's also used by artists as extra commentary (in a similar vein to the [code]title[/code] attribute of the [code]<img>[/code] element).

The alt text should be placed in the artist's commentary if it isn't automatically retrieved from the source.\r\n\r\nBe sure to add the [[commentary request]] tag if the text needs to be translated. If the source has multiple images with alt text attached to them, do not feature every image's alt text in the commentary of one image, unless necessary (ex. image #2's alt text builds off of image #1's alt text).

The exact dimensions of the flag are 4-2-4:5-2-9 for a total proportion of 10:16, which is number that approaches the golden ratio. Key things to take note of is that the blue fields towards the flagpole are [i]not[/i] square and the thickness of the cross is half of the blue fields' height.\r\n\r\nLegends say that Eric IX (\"Eric the Holy\") saw the golden cross in the sky when he landed in Finland during the first Swedish crusade in 1157. He took it as a sign from god and made it his flag. However, the legend doesn't match up to the historic usage of the flag nor is there evidence of such a crusade. More likely, the Swedish flag was created in resistance to Denmark -Sweden's arch-nemesis since ancient times- and took inspiration from their flag, [[danish_flag|Dannebrogen]]. The blue and yellow were already commonly used as Swedish colours, for example in [[tre kronor]] which is the national [[coat of arms]].\r\n\r\nThere is a military variant of the flag which is significantly longer and has the end cut into three tongues. The proportions on this flag is 1:2. The tongues are cut from each field with the outer edges of the blue fields remaining straight and uncut. The length of the tongues is such that the uncut part of the flag has equally much blue on each side of the cross. The proportions are thus best described as 4-2-4:5-2-5-[b]8[/b] where the last number is the tongues. This flag can have white 5-pointed stars in the upper right field to denote admiralty rank and are only used on navy vessels. Other versions exists with a white square on the centre of the cross. If the square extends outside the cross and has the coat of arms of Sweden, then it is the flag of the King and Queen. Other members of the royal family uses a variant with a smaller square that doesn't extend outside the cross and instead carry a different insignia on it.\r\n\r\nIn civilian usage the flag was almost exclusively used at sea. The biggest breakthrough towards flying the flag more was made on the 6th of June in 1916 when \"Day of the Swedish Flag\" was celebrated for the first time, a day which unofficially became Sweden's national holiday until it was officially recognized in 1983.\r\n\r\nThere are no strict laws governing the flying of the flag, except for the royal and military variants. Everyone is allowed to fly the flag whenever they want and for whatever reason that they find worth flying it for. However, there are several traditions and \"unwritten rules\" which are good customs to follow, the most important of which is to not fly the flag at night and to not fly the flag for no reason. The most common occasion that Swedes fly the flag for are birthdays and midsummer's eve. Swedish calendars also come with special \"flag days\" marked, which are good days to fly the flag on such as royal birthdays and historical anniversaries.\r\n\r\n* !asset #20125162\r\n\r\nh4.
