Ougon Bat made his debut in [i]Kamishibai[/i], a traveling show in which a sequence of pictures is narrated by a storyteller and was very famous before [[World War II]]. \r\n\r\nIn these early stories Ougon Bat was a superhero that had a golden skull shaped head, a green and white 17th century [[superhero costume|costume]] with a high collared red [[cape]] and was armed with a [[rapier]] [[sword]]. He possessed superhuman strength and invulnerability as well as the ability to fly. He also lived in a fortress in the Japanese Alps.\r\n\r\nIn the TV anime and the live action films from the 60s the character was a “God of justice and protector of the weak” from the ancient and legendary lost city of Atlantis who was put into suspended animation in a sarcophagus to be awakened in the future to fight the forces of evil. In the anime the character still has a golden skull head and the red cape, but now has a golden [[armor]]ed [[bodysuit]] and is armed with a [[staff]].\r\n\r\nIn the cancelled late 90s remake the character was re-imagined with a new skinnier and more gruesome look with vampire fangs in the golden skull as well as having the ability to fly with bat wings instead of the original [[Superman]]-styled flight.

Produced by Aniplex, made by Studio Pierrot and airing on Fuji TV, the show was an initial success in Japan, albeit with little merchandising and lackluster reruns. Animax would produce an English-language dub entitled '[i]Ghost at School[/i]' in 2004 for airing in other Asian markets. ADV Films would gain the rights for its English dub in native English markets a year later, with Aniplex only listing three criteria for the dub to meet in its contract:\r\n\r\n1. Do not change the names of any characters, including the ghosts. \r\n2. Do not change the way any ghost is killed, as it is based on Japanese folklore. \r\n3. Do not change the core meaning of any episode.\r\n\r\nThe resulting dub, known as [b]Ghost Stories[/b], would turn the series into a comedic self-parody, dramatically changing almost all of the characters' personalities, while otherwise roughly following the criteria listed. ADV's new, dark-comedy version turned out to be a hit, and the show took on a new international cult following, far overshadowing the original series and the first dub. Its success was such that it even led to misinformation surrounding the success of the series in Japan proper.\r\n\r\nh4.

When the trigger is pulled, there is a slight delay before a large green plasma ball is ejected. After the green ball hits any object, there is another slight delay before 40 invisible tracers are emitted from the player's body in a cone shape, like a shotgun blast, in the same direction the plasma ball was originally fired. The green ball itself deals significant damage to enemies when hit, but most of the potential damage from a BFG shot is from the tracers. Sufficiently skilled players can take advantage of this and consistently kill a [[Cyberdemon]], a boss monster with the most health in the game, in two BFG shots. This requires getting very close at the right times to maximize the number of tracers hitting the enemy, which is risky because the cyberdemon's rocket launcher is extremely damaging, guaranteed to one-shot players who have no armor or extra health.\r\n\r\nh4.

This move is similar to a clothesline, the difference being that in a [[clotheslining|clothesline]] the wrestler's arm is kept straight to the side of the wrestler during the move, while in the lariat the wrestler strikes their opponent with his arm.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple variants of lariat:\r\n\r\n1) Northern Lariat or Enzui Lariat: A lariat to the back of the opponent's neck and shoulders. Used by [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] alumnus and current [[WWE]] superstar Robert Roode.\r\n\r\n2) Burning Lariat or Short Range Lariat: A lariat where the wrestler doesn't run but simply strikes the opponent while standing next to him. The wrestler can also hold the opponent's head up before performing the lariat with his other arm. The Burning Lariat is a common variant among Japanese wrestlers, with retired Japanese wrestler Kobashi Kenta among of the users of this variation. \r\n\r\n3) Short-arm Lariat: A variation where the wrestler grabs one of the opponent's wrists with his hand and pulls the opponent closer, striking him with the lariat with his other arm. [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] wrestler [[Okada Kazuchika]]'s [[Rainmaker (wrestling)|Rainmaker]] finishing move is a variation of this, where he holds his opponent in a ripcord position then spins him out to hit the short-arm lariat.\r\n\r\n4) Discus Lariat: The wrestler spins in place before he hits the lariat. Used by the late [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestler/WWE alumnus Mr. Brodie Lee (a.k.a. Luke Harper)\r\n\r\nTypically, a lariat is used as a finishing move while the clothesline is simply a basic strike attack. The main difference aside from the mechanics of the movement is the stiffness.

The line sold well initially, but was eventually overtaken by Transformers.\r\n\r\nHanna Barbera produced a cartoon series called [i]Challenge of the GoBots[/i] to promote the toyline, which ran for 65 22-minute episodes from 1984 to 1985. \r\n\r\nThe main tagline for the original animated TV series was: [i]\"GoBots - Mighty Robots!!! Mighty Vehicles!!!\".[/i]\r\n \r\nIn 1986, soon after the end of the Challenge of the Gobots television series, the Gobots co-starred with the [i]\"Rock Lords\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Lords [/i]in an animated feature film [i]GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords[/i], again produced by Hanna Barbera.\r\n\r\nAlthough initially a separate and competing franchise, Tonka's Gobots became the intellectual property of Hasbro (owners of Transformers) after their buyout of Tonka in 1991. Subsequently, the universe depicted in the animated series Challenge of the GoBots and follow-up film GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords was established as an alternate universe within the Transformers franchise.\r\n \r\nWhile [[Hasbro]] now owns the fictional side of the property (character names, bios, storyline), the original vintage toys and their likenesses were only licensed from [[Bandai Namco]] in the 80s, were not covered by the Tonka acquisition, and are not available for Hasbro use.\r\n\r\nh4.

On Danbooru, the tanabata tag refers to this custom.\r\n\r\nTanabata originates from the [[Qixi festival]], written the same way. When Qixi made its way to Japan, it quickly got localized and was fused with several other local traditions, notably another folklore about the Tanabata-tsume (棚機津女), hence the reading \"Tanabata\", and the practice of hanging tanzuku on bamboos. \r\n\r\nTherefore, although written the same way, the terms should not be used interchangeably, Qixi applies strictly to the traditional Chinese version and Tanabata strictly the traditional Japanese version.\r\n\r\nh4.
