Leary[/i], named after a naval officer and rear Admiral who served from the [[American Civil War]] through the Spanish-American War. Like her sister ship the [[Heywood L. Edwards (Kancolle)|]], Leary survived World War II and was transferred to be a vessel in the new [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]], where she was given the name [i]Yūgure[/i]. The vessel was returned to the United States in 1974, and scrapped two years later. Designed by [[Zeco]], and first made available in-game in May, 2025.\r\n\r\nIn Kancolle, Richard P. Leary has short, [[brown hair]], [[brown eyes]], and [[medium breasts]] like her sisters. She wears a white [[dixie cup hat]], white [[elbow gloves]], colored [[serafuku]] with a [[black sailor collar]], a [[black skirt]], and [[black thighhighs]] under her armored greaves. Like her sister ship [[Heywood L. Edwards (Kancolle)|]], Leary at base wears a [[grey dress]] in a camouflage scheme, that changes to a [[blue dress]] similar to the rest of the Fletcher class at Kai. Also at Kai, Leary gains a bronze and a silver [[star (symbol)|]] on her collar akin to her sister [[Johnston (Kancolle)|]], symbolizing the six Battle Stars awarded to the historical vessel for her wartime service. \r\n\r\nLeary's [[rigging]] comes in multiple pieces: two hull sections attached to each leg hold racks of depth charges, with the section on her left side also mounting her fire-control director and [[radar]]. Another section attaches to her back, splitting off and holding one [[smokestack]] and one five-inch gun mount to either side. Leary's damaged art shows this section also contains a platform at the small of her back for a twin [[Bofors 40 mm Gun]] mount. She carries a third five-inch gun mount in a separate slung weapon similar to the rest of the Fletcher class. Leary's rigging does not change between Base and Kai; rather, Base is colored in a camouflage paint scheme, while Leary Kai's rigging is colored in the \"Measure 22\":[https://www.shipcamouflage.com/measure_22.htm] paint scheme, with layers of red, blue, and grey color. \r\n\r\nWhile a new Fletcher with some resemblance to Richard P. Leary's design (and wearing a yellow bikini almost identical to what would later be revealed as Leary's swimsuit skin) was teased by Zeco in the \"2024 Kancolle Calendar\":[/posts/7036375], Leary's first true introduction was during the 12th Anniversary Lawson collaboration during the Spring 2025 Event. She made it into the game proper once that event had come to a close. \r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\n\r\n* !post #9295365: Base\r\n* !post #9296494: [[Richard P.

A [[dragon girl]] in human form. Designed by [[Yaman]].\r\n\r\nShe has [[very long hair|very long]] [[orange hair]] with a single [[blonde hair|yellow]] [[streaked hair|lock of hair]] near her forehead. Her regular hairstyle is [[straight hair]] with an [[ahoge]], [[hair intakes]] held with a [[black hairband]], [[fanged bangs|fanged]] [[blunt bangs]], [[sidelocks]] and a [[side braid]]. She also has a pair of [[dragon horns]] with a [[horn bow|bow]] on her right horn, [[pointy ears]], [[red eyes]] with [[white pupils|white]] [[slit pupils]], a long purple [[dragon tail]] (which she had a running gag of it being a [[butt plug]] [[anal tail|tail]]). She also has quite [[large breasts]], with her subsequent outfits making them [[huge breasts|noticeably larger]].\r\n\r\nShe is fluent in English, and quite eccentric (due to being a half-American). Hosted a morning \"news show\"-esque 20-minute program on weekdays named \"AsaCoco\" (Morning Coco), which usually ended up creating absurd memes - such as [[Himemori Luna]]'s English Corner, where the cute, childish princess constantly spews out obscenities, and most notably the drug \"[[asacoco]]\", a potent stimulant available to be delivered in a wide variety of forms ranging from needles to anal plugs.\r\n\r\nDespite her wild antics, insane gags and frequent foul language (which often got her into trouble with YouTube), she is very eager to help her friends if need be and has a mature, big sister-like approach to troublesome situations (though usually laced with some of her personal brand of humor to break the seriousness if it's too much).\r\n\r\nShe was considered to have the second largest bust in hololive after [[Tsukumo Sana]], even toppling [[Shirogane Noel]]'s K-night cups. She was also significantly taller than the rest of the hololive girls (180 cm, compared with [[Omega Alpha]], who is the second tallest at 175 cm without counting the gigantic Sana), especially the rest of the 4th generation (Kanata, Towa and Watame are all about 150 cm tall, Luna is the shortest at 140 cm, boosted to 150 cm with her shoes and crown).\r\n\r\nShe was the real-life roommate of [[Amane Kanata]], and the apartment that they lived in together was called by other visiting hololive members as the \"KanaCoco House\". This means that they could (and had several times) make appearances on each other's streams.\r\n\r\nShe is in fact a big [[Ryuu ga Gotoku (series)|]] fangirl and has been known to play games of the series. In fact, her name and her title of \"Chairwoman\" (\"会長\" - [i]Kaichou[/i]) are direct references to [[Kiryu Kazuma]].\r\n\r\nKiryu Coco reached one million YouTube subscribers on February 17, 2021.\r\n\r\nShe announced her graduation from Hololive on June 8, 2021. Her final act was a live concert on July 1, 2021, which became one of the most viewed live streams in Hololive and VTuber history, reaching over 498,000 concurrent viewers.\r\n\r\nh4.

Starring in several cartoons and anime, movies, a hit video game series, and holds the record for the longest running comic book series based from a [[video game]] franchise. \r\n\r\nThe main hero of the [[Sonic (series)|]] franchise, [b]Sonic the Hedgehog[/b] is a blue-colored hedgehog who can run at extremely fast speeds, and has a upbeat personality with a smarty-pants attitude while always looking forward to adventures. He loves chili dogs and rock music. He makes friends easily, but will equally not forgive anyone who threatens his friends and the world. His long-time nemesis is [[Dr. Eggman]], but they seem to uphold their rivalry on decent terms. Sonic can also change his form state, by collecting all 7 of the [[Chaos Emerald]]s and harnessing their positive energy to transform into Super Sonic; which bears a striking resemblance to a [[Super Saiyan]] from the [[Dragon Ball Z]] universe. This in turn grants him exponential speed and power increases, among flight abilities also making him immune to most attacks. \r\n\r\nSonic was designed and created by Japanese artist and game designer \"Oshima Naoto\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_%C5%8Cshima. He was initially codenamed \"Mr. Needlemouse\" during development as Sega's new mascot and was originally colored teal. His trademark blue pigmentation was chosen later to match Sega's cobalt blue logo. \"Uekawa Yuji\":http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Yuji_Uekawa provided the revamping of Sonic The Hedgehog's art style with the shift to the 3D era with the [[Sonic Adventure]] games around 1998.\r\n\r\nSonic replaced [[Alex Kidd (character)|Alex Kidd]] as the official mascot of [[SEGA]] Corporation since 1991.\r\n\r\nVoiced by [[Kanemaru Jun'ichi]] in Japan, and [[Jaleel White]], [[Martin Burke]], [[Ryan Drummond]], [[Jason Griffith]], and [[Roger Craig Smith]] in North America.\r\n\r\nh4.
