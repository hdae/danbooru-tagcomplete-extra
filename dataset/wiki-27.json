The war began on 7 July 1937 when Japan invaded Manchuria,   and was arguably the start of [[World War II]]. The war, and World War II, ended with the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II on 2 September 1945.\r\n\r\nThe war is a result of an escalation of Imperial Japan's ambitions in the east Asia according to the so-called \"Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere\" policy. While the war caused various warlord factions participated in the [[Chinese Civil War]] to temporarily unite in effort to defend the country, the ill-equipped Chinese forces suffered massive losses due to their dated equipment, though not without stalling the Japanese advance and inflicting large amount of casualties as well. In total, between 15 to 21 millions people died during the war, making it the second deadliest war in the 20th century. \r\n\r\nThe war is also infamous for numerous atrocities committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], in particular after the battle of Nanjing. The atrocity ranges from mass [[rape]], indiscriminate mass killing, forced labor, usage of conventional and chemical weapons against civilians, and much more. Due to the modern Japanese government upheld the policy of \"don't deny, don't admit\" to not comment anything about the war, it still remains contentious issue between China and Japan (and Taiwan to an extent) to this day.\r\n\r\nIn Manchuria, Japan set up a puppet state called [[Manchukuo]], while in Inner Mongolia their puppet state in the [[Mongol United Autonomous Government]] had established a new government in the form of Mengjiang (also known as Mengkukuo in the West).\r\n\r\nh4.

This version is popularized by Chris Benoit. [[WWE]] Hall of Famer and current [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestler [[Edge (wrestler)|Adam Copeland/Edge]] also uses this move as well as his own variant called the [i]Glasgow Grin[/i], where he uses a broken piece of a [[folding chair]] to gain more leverage in applying pressure to the opponent's neck. Copeland also uses the standard, legal version that he calls as the [I]Grindhouse[/I], which he sometimes combines with a [[sleeper hold]].\r\n\r\n- [i]Omoplata Crossface[/i]: The wrestler takes an opponent’s arm and puts it in an [[omoplata]]. From there, the wrestler puts the opponent in a crossface, wrenching the neck and shoulder. Popularized by [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestler [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] as the [i]LeBell Lock[/i] (also formerly known as the [i]YES! Lock[/i] or [i]NO! Lock[/i]). [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] wrestler KENTA also uses this as the [i]Game Over[/i].\r\n\r\n- [i]Chickenwing Over-the-Shoulder Crossface[/i]: The wrestler goes to a fallen opponent and places the opponent's nearest arm over the wrestler's nearest shoulder before applying the crossface, where the attacking wrestler locks their hands around the opponent's chin (or lower face), then pulls back, stretching the opponent's neck and shoulder. WWE wrestler Johnny Gargano uses this as his finisher named the [i]Gargano Escape[/i], which he adopted from his mentor, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] alumnus and fellow WWE wrestler [[Alex Shelley]], who calls this move as the [i]Border City Stretch[/i]. New Japan Pro Wrestling wrestler Ishimori Taiji also uses this move as the [i]Bone Lock[/i]. All Elite Wrestling wrestler Lee Moriarty also uses this move with Shelley's blessing just like Gargano (though unlike Gargano, who renamed the hold for his own use, Moriarty retained the Border City Stretch name).\r\n\r\n- [i][[brutalizer|Scissored Armbar Crossface]][/i]: Innovated by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] wrestler Nagata Yuuji as the [I]Nagata Lock III[/I], it is also known as a [i]Double Underhook Crossface[/i] or a [i]Double Arm Crossface[/i]. It is a scissored armbar combined with a crossface, where the attacking wrestler traps one of the prone opponent's arms in his/her legs, wraps the opponent's other arm under the attacker's shoulder, and then applies the crossface. All Elite Wrestling wrestlers Pac and Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D. both use this variant, with the former calling his version the [i]Brutalizer[/i] and the latter's version the [i]Lockjaw[/i] which also has a mandible claw added to fit her dentist gimmick (which is also her real-life profession). Former professional wrestler [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] also used it as the [i]Batista Bite[/i]. WWE wrestler Tommaso Ciampa started using it again in 2023 as the [I]Sicilian Stretch[/I]. All Elite Wrestling wrestler Julia Hart has a sitting variation of this hold that she calls as the [I]Hartless[/I].\r\n\r\n- [i]Bridging Crossface[/i]: A variant performed in a bridging position where the wrestler wraps both hands around the opponent's neck and pulls back, which applies pressure to the neck and bridges on the opponent's back for added leverage. However, it has no arm-trap involved unlike other crossface variants. This variation is used as a submission finisher by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[World Wonder Ring Stardom]] wrestler Mercedes Mone (formerly known as [[Sasha Banks]] in WWE) as the [i]Bank Statement[/i] in WWE and [I]Statement Maker[/I] in AEW.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クリップラー・クロスフェイス","クロスフェイス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":95480,"created_at":"2018-03-11T14:13:37.818-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-12T10:52:10.804-05:00","title":"alex_shelley","body":"American professional wrestler, currently working for [[WWE]].

Since his youth, Jack swore to kill Yujiro in combat to get revenge for his mother for the trauma Yujiro has caused. To this end, Jack fanatically trains to become stronger while disregarding anything he deems \"unnecessary\" such as eating or bathing, to the point that his body became bone-tight skinny and that he could only move by his sheer will to live. Noticing his determination, an American scientist offered a \"super steroid\" that massively increases his muscle mass, which allowed him to endure the rigorous training he partook in.\r\n\r\nWhile generally reserved and quiet outside of the fight, Jack is a ferocious fighter that will use any means necessary to obtain more strength and win, even if it means shortening his lifespan. He regularly takes bottles of steroids and stimuli as a part of his training (which he was able to endure the side effects of due to his \"Hanma blood\"), and has multiple body modification surgeries to increase his stature.

The series was created by Lauren Faust.\r\n\r\nIt was designed to appeal to a broader audience by avoiding the usual trends of shows intended for children and girls, and occasionally has jokes that younger viewers would not understand. Because of this, the show has gained a large fanbase of teenagers and adults, and the crew of the show sometimes inserts jokes or references to these fans.\r\n\r\nOriginally only seasons 1 and 2 were dubbed in Japanese, but the dub picked back up (albeit with a new voice cast) starting in 2018 and is still ongoing, currently up to season 6.\r\n\r\nFor a list of characters, see [[List of My Little Pony characters]].\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[cutie mark]]\r\n\r\nh4.
