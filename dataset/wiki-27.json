For posts which refer to the short story specifically, tag it with the mythos tag.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, Call of Cthulhu is the predominant TRPG (table talk RPG) of choice in the 21st century, over Dungeons and Dragons which previously dominated TRPG circles there, building off the TRPG fan culture tradition of 'replays' (novelizations of sessions, often paired with visuals to go with the text) with play videos (prerecorded or live) on Niconico and YouTube (ex. [[Yukkuri-tachi no Cthulhu no Yobikoe]]). Combined with general continued popularity for 20th century western authors such as Lovecraft, an accessible and easy-to-learn 'Basic Roleplaying' system which allows players to shape the scenarios as they wish (leading to many non-combat/horror-oriented scenarios), publisher support, player-created tools (such as CCFOLIA), and domestically-exclusive scenarios, CoC dominates. In turn, this has resulted in much fanart based on Japanese scenarios.\r\n\r\nh4. Call of Cthulhu-related tags\r\n\r\nh5.

History\r\nIn real life, [i]West Virginia[/i] was among the battleships sunk in Pearl Harbor, moored outboard of [[Tennessee (Azur Lane)|]] and thus took the brunt of the damage. Refloated in May 1942, she was modernized in the West Coast in a style similar to the Tennessee-class: turning their superstructures into a compact form reminiscent of [[South Dakota (Azur Lane)|]]. Unlike the two Tennessee-class ships, the scale of her damage and modernization meant she only reentered active service in mid-1944, in time for the battle of Leyte Gulf. Here, she led the battle line that engaged \"Nishimura's fleet\":/pools/9549 in the last battleship-to-battleship engagement in history, firing the opening shots against [[Yamashiro (Azur Lane)|]] from 20.8 km out and Mogami from Artillery bombardment, knocking the Heavy Cruiser out of action.\r\n\r\nLater seeing service in Iwo Jima and Okinawa, she was decommissioned in 1947 and scrapped 12 years later.\r\n\r\nh4.

However, a large complement of [[mecha]], which included several [[destroid]]s and the brand new [[VF-4]] variable fighters, were onboard the new vessel.

This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.\r\n\r\nThese ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the [[ARMD]] carriers but the U.N.G. remains committed to replacing the older ARMD carriers one by one with Uraga Class ships.

Very easy to produce, repair, modify and pilot, the Regult is usually deployed in very vast numbers and in massive attack waves to overwhelm, encircle and obliterate the enemy.

He and his wife, Thea von Harbou, wrote the silent film, which starred Gustav Fröhlich, Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. \r\n\r\nIt is regarded as a pioneering work of the serious science fiction genre in movies, being among the first feature length movies of the genre ever made. It also has been considered a semi-[[cyberpunk]] film created many decades before the genre even began. \r\n\r\nMetropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's ruler, and Maria, a poor worker, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city. \r\n\r\nThe movie was made in [[Germany]] during the \"Weimar Period\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic]. Filming took place in 1925 at a cost of approximately five million Reichsmarks. The art direction draws influence from Bauhaus, Cubist and Futurist design.\r\n\r\nMetropolis was met with a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it pictorially beautiful and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of naiveté.\r\n\r\nNumerous attempts have been made to restore the film since the 1970s. Music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists such as [[Freddie Mercury]], Loverboy and Adam Ant in 1984. A new reconstruction of Metropolis was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 2001, and the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in the same year, the first film thus distinguished. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process, the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\r\n\r\nh4.

History\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) was the [[military]] arm of the anti-communist nation of South Vietnam, from the country's inception during the post-colonial division of Indochina in 1955, until the reunification of Vietnam in 1975. During those twenty years, ARVN was effectively in a constant state of war against [[communism|communist]] forces: fighting both a [[guerilla]] insurgency in the south of the country against the [[viet cong|National Liberation Front]], and a conventional conflict in the north of the country against the North Vietnam's military arm, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN).\r\n\r\nEven after the mass deployment of American and Allied forces in 1965, ARVN forces continued to bear the brunt of the fighting during the [[Vietnam War]]. Unfortunately, ARVN also became more and more tied to the politics of South Vietnam, and political officer appointments, corruption and factional infighting continually degraded the army's ability to continue the conflict. Despite these issues, ARVN's efforts continued to prove decisive, from 1967 to 1968 to 1972.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of Allied troops in 1973, end of American supplies in 1974, and PAVN offensive in 1975 together proved to be the death knell for South Vietnam. Though ARVN troops continued to fight bravely in places, even lacking arms and ammunition, the country they fought to defend was rapidly collapsing. On 30 April 1975, PAVN forces captured the South Vietnamese capital city of Saigon (modern day [[Ho Chi Minh]] City), and what was left of the South Vietnamese government either surrendered or fled. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, and the country said army was pledged to defend, had ceased to exist. \r\n\r\nh1.
