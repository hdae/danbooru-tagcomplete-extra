He is regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. \r\n\r\nHis films, typically adaptations of novels or short stories, are noted for their \"dazzling\" and unique cinematography, attention to details to achieve realism and an inspired use of music scores. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and [[science fiction]]. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors.\r\n\r\nStarting out as a photographer in New York City, he taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. His earliest films were made on a shoestring budget, followed by one Hollywood blockbuster, [i]Spartacus[/i] (1960), after which he spent most of the rest of his career living and filming in the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nMany of his films broke new ground in cinematography, including [[2001 A Space Odyssey]] (1968), [i]Barry Lyndon[/i] (1975), and [[The Shining]] (1980). \r\n\r\nWhile some of Kubrick's films were controversial with mixed reviews, such as [i]Paths of Glory[/i] (1957), [b]Lolita[/b] (1962), [[Dr. Strangelove]] (1964) and [[A Clockwork Orange]] (1971), most of his movies were nominated for either Oscars, Golden Globes or BAFTAs, and were later acclaimed as being masterpieces.\r\n\r\nWidely used what is popularly known as the [[Kubrick stare]] in his films.\r\n\r\nh4.

Bahamoot is immune to enemy attacks, capable of blocking most projectiles and damaging enemies on contact; Kayus, however, is not, but is armed with a forward-firing energy crossbow.\r\n\r\nBahamoot can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power; at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon's head. The game also contains some platforming elements - Kayus is able to dismount on horizontal platforms and fire his weapon from there.\r\n\r\nBahamoot's body is flexible and responds to Kayus' movement, enabling Kayus to use Bahamoot as a mobile shield or as a whip-like weapon. The player can also circle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the player to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.\r\n\r\nThe original video game ran on M72 and M81 hardware, and was converted to several home computer platforms (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum) by Activision in 1990.\r\n\r\nh4.

The story is based on the F. Paul Wilson novel of the same name, published in 1981 (1982 in the United Kingdom).\r\n\r\nBecause of studio medling and interference the production of the film was very troubled and the final movie was both a critical and comercial failure. \r\n\r\nHowever, due to some very awesome imagery and cinematography, haunting visuals as well as an epic and enigmatic ethereal score -composed mostly of moody soundscapes- by German Electronic band \"Tangerine Dream\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream , it has achieved cult status and has become a very popular rare obscure film over the years. \r\n\r\nh4.
