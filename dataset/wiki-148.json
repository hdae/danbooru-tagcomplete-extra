The physical component for [[Alice Margatroid]]'s spellcard \"Eerily Luminous Shanghai Doll\" in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] / [[Immaterial and Missing Power]], as well as her familiar in [[Imperishable Night]].\r\n\r\nShanghai is a very popular supporting character (or artifact) in [[Touhou]] fan art depicting Alice.\r\n\r\nSome comic artists give the [[doll]] a personality and feelings of its own, making it a \"master doll\" that helps control the lesser dolls. Others show it as Alice's primary magically-controlled \"puppet\". These points of view can be mixed, possibly to give an impression of Alice \"debating with herself\" through doll use, reminiscent of the way ventriloquists use puppets. Sometimes she/it is even depicted as lacking \"doll\" traits entirely, resembling a [[minigirl]].\r\n\r\nAnother view is that Shanghai is a type or class of magical dolls rather than an individual doll. This is based on the fact that several Shanghai dolls are seen simultaneously in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]].\r\n\r\nCanonically, Shanghai, like all the rest of Alice's dolls, is a mindless drone that requires direct supervision for all but the most basic of autonomous action, despite Alice's ongoing efforts to create a truly sapient construct.

[[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] mixed martial artist Nate Diaz infamously won a match using the triangle choke, where he insulted his opponent by showing [[middle finger|middle fingers]] and [[flexing]] his muscles while locking the hold.

The choke involves using the arms to encircle the opponent's neck in a fashion similar to the [[guillotine]], an [[execution]] apparatus.\r\n\r\nLike a rear naked choke, body scissors can be optionally applied while cinching the guillotine choke to further restrain the opponent's movement.\r\n\r\nIn professional wrestling, the term \"guillotine choke\" is used if the wrestler performing the hold also applies a body scissors. Without the body scissors, it will be called as a \"front chancery\" instead. The guillotine choke is used by various wrestlers, such as [[WWE]] wrestler [[Roman Reigns]], WWE alumni and current [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestlers [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] and Kyle O'Reilly, and [i]Ring of Honor[/i] alumnus Jimmy Jacobs.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フロントチョーク","ギロチンチョーク"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":86498,"created_at":"2017-05-15T09:28:17.353-04:00","updated_at":"2022-11-23T00:45:30.635-05:00","title":"crossface_chickenwing","body":"A [[submission hold]] made famous by [[WWE]] Hall of Famer Bob Backlund and currently used by WWE wrestler [[Asuka (Wrestler)|Asuka]] (which she calls the Asuka Lock), [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestler Frankie Kazarian, and indie wrestler Marty Scurll.\r\n\r\nTo execute this move, the wrestler first performs the chickenwing to one of the opponent's arms. He then takes his other arms, wraps it around the opponent's neck, and then either pulls the wrestler's head to the side which puts pressure on the neck and shoulders or leaves the arm tucked under the chin as in a one-armed [[sleeper hold]]. Depending on the wrestler's preference, he may clasp his hands together to secure the hold.

Alternatively, go to the \"User Feedbacks page\":[/user_feedbacks] and click \"New\":[/user_feedbacks/new] at the top.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of feedback: positive, neutral, and negative. Positive feedbacks are given for good behavior, and negative feedbacks are for bad behavior.

Before giving a user a negative feedback, you should communicate with them privately to tell them what they're doing wrong and how to improve. Negative feedback should only be given for flagrant rule violations, or for continued bad behavior after having been warned. A neutral feedback should normally be given first, unless the user is deliberately breaking the rules, such as engaging in intentional vandalism or sockpuppeting.\r\n\r\nIf you have received a negative feedback, and you think it's unfair, or the problem has been resolved, you can appeal to have it removed by petitioning the mods or admins on the forum.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":153411,"created_at":"2022-11-20T16:45:15.227-05:00","updated_at":"2022-11-20T16:45:15.227-05:00","title":"garra_de_alanza","body":"[[Loba (apex legends)|]]'s heirloom weapon in [[Apex Legends]].
