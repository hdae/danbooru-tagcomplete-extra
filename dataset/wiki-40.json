It won the Hugo Award in 1966, and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. Dune is frequently cited as the world's best-selling [[science fiction]] novel of all time.\r\n\r\nSet thousands of years into the far future, amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary fiefdoms are controlled by noble houses that owe an allegiance to the Imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young [[Paul Atreides]] (the heir apparent to Duke [[Leto Atreides]] and the heir of House Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the [[desert]] [[planet]] [[Dune (planet)|Arrakis]], the only source of the \"spice\" melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe. The story explores the complex and multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the forces of the Empire confront each other for control of Arrakis and its \"spice\".\r\n\r\nHerbert wrote five sequels to the novel Dune: [i]Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune,[/i] and [i]Chapterhouse: Dune[/i]. The first novel has been adapted into a 1984 film by David Lynch, a 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries [i]Frank Herbert's Dune[/i] and its 2003 sequel [i]Frank Herbert's Children of Dune[/i], and a 2021/2024 two-part film by Denis Villeneuve, as well as computer games, a board game, and songs. The franchise has also been continued beyond Herbert's death in 1986, with a series of prequels, interquels, and sequels that were co-written by Kevin J. Anderson and the author's son, Brian Herbert, starting in 1999.\r\n\r\nh4. Works\r\n\r\n* [[Dune (1984 movie)]]\r\n* [[Dune (2021 movie)]]\r\n* [[Dune: Part Two]]\r\n\r\nh4.Characters\r\n\r\nh6.

With heavy focus on the masculine features and appeal of [[mature male|men]]. \r\n\r\nWhile mostly dependent on an artist's personal tastes, the ‘bara’ archetype features 3 main body types:\r\n* Bear-type bodies, (typically tagged as [[plump]] or [[fat]]), are generally softer and rounder looking, with varying degrees of visible musculature.\r\n- Artists: [[Suv (suv032)|]], [[Kuro nezumi inu]], [[Tevit (tevit15)|]].\r\n\r\n* Hunks/Jocks or [[muscular|Muscular-type]] bodies, in contrast to the chiseled [[v-taper | triangular look]] of professional bodybuilders, have defined musculature that is usually more proportional overall, similar to that of athletic \"strongman\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongman], with a [[strongman waist | wider waist]] (\"comparison\":[https://cdn.donmai.us/original/e8/4f/e84f5efad6fd9ef1ff268d1982a564d6.jpg]), though the more [[shredded muscle | chiseled]] appearance can be a stylistic choice (see [[Nikism]] for reference).\r\n- Artists: [[Tarutoru]], [[Crow (siranui)|]], [[Dopey (dopq)|]].\r\n\r\n* Twunk or otter-type bodies, tagged [[toned]], [i]or[/i] [[muscular]] (especially with younger or sometimes older [[mature male]]s). \r\n- Artists: [[itto_(mentaiko)|Mentaiko]], [[Homri]], [[Torakichi (ebitendon)|]], [[Kuroshinki]]. \r\n\r\nMusculature, when depicted, is typically more exaggerated for emphasis (e.g. [[pectorals|pecs]]) along with the [[bulge]] (implying an exaggerated penis size), and both are usually rather noticeable even when the subject is wearing clothes -  abnormally so. When this exaggeration is paired with the points above, which assert a softer approach when drawing the male form, the 'bara' archetype becomes noticeable.\r\n\r\nCommon masculine features on subjects include: different degrees of [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]] (especially the [[navel hair|happy trail]] leading to [[male pubic hair|pubic hair]]) - or a complete absence of it in the case of younger characters (depending on the artist's tastes), [[thick eyebrows|thick]], [[eyebrow cut|cut]] or [[forked eyebrows|bushy eyebrows]], [[sideburns]], [[buzz cut]], [[large hands]], [[scar]]s, [[tattoo]]s, [[bandaid]]s, [[bandage]]s, [[wrinkled skin|wrinkles]] (visible with [[mature male|mature]] and [[old man|old]] men), etc.\r\n\r\nAll of these characteristics lend the style a degree of flexibility that allows for further stylization as well as broader cultural mixing between communities; for instance, despite bara’s roots in opposition to them, there is substantial cross-over with the larger [[yaoi|Boys' Love]] community - which can be seen in some artists' styles (E.g [[Yotti]], [[Arima (arima_bn)|]]). It can also be applied to non-human and humanoid characters, such as [[furry male]]s  (E.g [[Wafu (youzora_samo18)|]], [[Boogbogex]]).\r\n\r\n[expand= History and meaning]\r\n\r\nThe word \"bara\" literally means \"rose\" in Japanese. The term originally comes from the magazine \"Barazoku\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barazoku], Japan's first gay men's magazine, with the term traditionally referring to more [[bishounen]]-esque men. As a result, the word \"bara\" also began being used as a slang term for any male homoerotic works in general (similar to the use of [[yaoi]] in the West).\r\n\r\nThe word \"bara\" as used here is primarily Western, stemming more from its application on art more commonly known as \"gei komi\", \"gei manga\", or \"mens love\" in Japan, a practice that began on Japanese imageboards, where they intentionally misappropriated the term, this interpretation later being exported abroad. Whilst some Japanese gei komi creators oppose the usage of \"bara\" due to its earlier legacy, others have embraced it. Note that, like most Manga Demographics, bara is commonly defined in terms of the target audience, not the authors or the subject matter.\r\n\r\nBara conceptually often contrasts with yaoi, which is gay male media traditionally made by heterosexual women to appeal to other heterosexual women. Whereas bara is gay/bi male media made by gay/bi men for gay/bi men, that generally features romantic and sexual relationships between [[muscular]] [[mature male|mature men]] and realistic(ish) relationships, often including LGBTQ issues, [[yaoi]] generally features androgynous, idealized, effeminate characters and melodramatic plots devoid of LGBTQ issues (like most [[yuri]], for similar root reasons). By its nature, it is also heteronormative, whether by stereotypically depicting overly emotional relationships or using concepts such as \"uke\" and \"seme,\" and includes themes of homosociality, which contributed more to the clash between fans of the two genres, though nowadays there's a grey area between the two. What they share in common the most though is the fact that non-Japanese audiences have misappropriated them, with yaoi having become a generalized weeb term for anything involving gay men.\r\n [/expand]\r\n\r\nh4.

The exact dimensions of the flag are 4-2-4:5-2-9 for a total proportion of 10:16, which is number that approaches the golden ratio. Key things to take note of is that the blue fields towards the flagpole are [i]not[/i] square and the thickness of the cross is half of the blue fields' height.\r\n\r\nLegends say that Eric IX (\"Eric the Holy\") saw the golden cross in the sky when he landed in Finland during the first Swedish crusade in 1157. He took it as a sign from god and made it his flag. However, the legend doesn't match up to the historic usage of the flag nor is there evidence of such a crusade. More likely, the Swedish flag was created in resistance to Denmark -Sweden's arch-nemesis since ancient times- and took inspiration from their flag, [[danish_flag|Dannebrogen]]. The blue and yellow were already commonly used as Swedish colours, for example in [[tre kronor]] which is the national [[coat of arms]].\r\n\r\nThere is a military variant of the flag which is significantly longer and has the end cut into three tongues. The proportions on this flag is 1:2. The tongues are cut from each field with the outer edges of the blue fields remaining straight and uncut. The length of the tongues is such that the uncut part of the flag has equally much blue on each side of the cross. The proportions are thus best described as 4-2-4:5-2-5-[b]8[/b] where the last number is the tongues. This flag can have white 5-pointed stars in the upper right field to denote admiralty rank and are only used on navy vessels. Other versions exists with a white square on the centre of the cross. If the square extends outside the cross and has the coat of arms of Sweden, then it is the flag of the King and Queen. Other members of the royal family uses a variant with a smaller square that doesn't extend outside the cross and instead carry a different insignia on it.\r\n\r\nIn civilian usage the flag was almost exclusively used at sea. The biggest breakthrough towards flying the flag more was made on the 6th of June in 1916 when \"Day of the Swedish Flag\" was celebrated for the first time, a day which unofficially became Sweden's national holiday until it was officially recognized in 1983.\r\n\r\nThere are no strict laws governing the flying of the flag, except for the royal and military variants. Everyone is allowed to fly the flag whenever they want and for whatever reason that they find worth flying it for. However, there are several traditions and \"unwritten rules\" which are good customs to follow, the most important of which is to not fly the flag at night and to not fly the flag for no reason. The most common occasion that Swedes fly the flag for are birthdays and midsummer's eve. Swedish calendars also come with special \"flag days\" marked, which are good days to fly the flag on such as royal birthdays and historical anniversaries.\r\n\r\n* !asset #20125162\r\n\r\nh4.

It is most commonly worn on the torso and arm area of the body. Health and safety regulations often require the use of high visibility clothing as it is a form of personal protective equipment.[1][2][3] Many colors of high visibility vests are available, with yellow and orange being the most common examples. Colors other than yellow or orange may not provide adequate luminescence for conformity to standards such as ISO 20471.\r\n\r\nAs a form of personal protective equipment, high-visibility clothing is worn to increase a person's visibility and therefore prevent accidents caused by persons not being seen. As a result, it is often worn in occupations where hazardous situations are created by moving vehicles or low lighting conditions. These occupations include railway and road workers, airport workers and emergency services. Cyclists and motorcyclists may also use high-visibility clothing to increase their visibility when operating amongst motor traffic.[4] Hunters may be required to wear designated high-visibility clothing to prevent accidental shooting.

First created by Westwood Studios, and later by [[Electronic Arts]] after they acquired Westwood and later dissolved Westwood Studios in 2003.  \r\n\r\nMany former Westwood staff founded the studio Petroglyph Games, which was tapped by EA to develop a remaster of the original C&C games that was released in 2020.  Along with Westwood's previous RTS game Dune 2 (based on the sci-fi series [[Dune (series)|]]), the early C&C games helped codified the RTS genre.  The games were well know for their large tanks, live action cutscenes, mostly solid (albeit cheesy) story in the earlier installments, and great music.\r\n\r\nThe three C&C sub series:\r\n\r\n* [i]Tiberium[/i] series (C&C Tiberian Dawn, [[Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun]], [[Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars]], C&C4 Tiberium Twilight): A toxic green alien space substance crashes on Earth.  Initially a boon by leeching out important minerals from the ground, making mining and energy easier to come by, it starts replicating out of control and mutating the landscape. Two initial factions, the UN agency the [[Global Defense Initiative]] and the mysterious cult the [[Brotherhood of Nod]], end up fighting over control of the world.\r\n\r\n* [i]Red Alert[/i] series ([[Command and Conquer: Red Alert]], [[command & conquer: red alert 2|RA2]], [[command & conquer: red alert 3|RA3]]):  After World War II, [[Albert Einstein]] creates a time machine and goes back in time to erase [[Adolf Hitler]] from the timeline.  This ends up causing a timeline with a stronger Soviet Union that invades Europe.  The two initial factions were the Allies and the Soviet Union.  They're later joined by the third faction, The Empire of the Rising Sun.  The series generally has a much campier tone and comic book style plot.

Her [[rigging]] consists of a large white circle to her back with a [[sakuramon]] and [[radar]] antenna plus six 100 mm twin [[anti-aircraft gun|DP mounts]], and two hull pieces, one on each side, containing her four 203 mm triple mounts.

History\r\nIt is actually debatable as to whether or not plans for [i]Unzen[/i] actually existed due to the destruction of sensitive information by the IJN prior to surrender. What is known is that a triple 203 mm gun mount, never actually mounted on any Japanese CA, was considered for eight ships planned under the Sixth Naval Armaments Program but no other information has survived. Certain postwar sources such as [i]Japanese Cruisers of the Pacific War[/i] and [i]Uncompleted Fleet Plan - 1917~1950[/i], from where the [i]Unzen[/i]/[i][[Zao (cruiser)|Zaou]][/i] design was based from, are informed guesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, more information surfaces that the Zao-class cruisers are confirmed to be \"Type A 1941 Heavy Cruiser\" projects in which is derive to the later Mogami and Tone-class cruisers, armed with a Triple 203mm experimental mount and Experimental Torpedo mount.\r\n\r\nh4.
