Akazukin has lost all of her memories and doesn't even know who she really is. Her reason to want to be eaten by Mr. Wolf is not even known to her, instead it's a desire that is locked deep within her consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe beings of the world are mainly made up of two forces. The people who aid Akazukin in her search for Mr. Wolf, and the people who try to keep Akazukin away from Mr. Wolf. The people of the church and disciples of God try to keep Akazukin from completing her mission to meet Mr. Wolf. Their reason for doing this is because if Akazukin is eaten by the Wolf, it would bring along an end to the world and humankind as it exists in the present day. The people whose origins are from the underworld aid Akazukin to find Mr. Wolf so the fate of the world being destroyed can be fulfilled. They mainly do this discreetly and behind the shadows.\r\n\r\nAkazukin works as an organ harvester for an Italian butcher named Marco. From there she hunts new bodies for him and all the while tries to find Mr. Wolf. Along the way she meets villains who stand in her way from fulfilling her wish to be eaten by Mr. Wolf.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Red_Hood","is_locked":false,"other_names":["東京赤ずきん"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":155019,"created_at":"2022-12-21T16:31:36.617-05:00","updated_at":"2025-05-17T20:55:41.420-04:00","title":"male_robin_(festive_tactician)_(fire_emblem)","body":"Tag used for [[Male robin (fire emblem)|Male Robin]] from [[Fire Emblem]] specifically when dressed in his winter attire from the [[Fire Emblem Heroes]] 2017 \"Winter's Envoy\":[https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Winter's_Envoy_(Focus)] banner.\r\n\r\nCan typically be identified thanks to the attire's characteristics: A red [[cloak]] with [[gold trim]] and a [[star (symbol)|]]-shaped pattern on the sleeves, a white [[tunic]] over a black [[undershirt]], red [[mittens]], black [[boots]], and a fake [[christmas tree]] with a [[candy cane]] for the log.\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible (especially for older artwork), to depict Male Robin in a winter outfit without it being the one described above, in which case this tag should not be used.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["winter_robin","christmas_robin","robin_(christmas)_(fire_emblem)_(male)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":155114,"created_at":"2022-12-22T18:03:42.040-05:00","updated_at":"2025-05-17T20:55:15.665-04:00","title":"nino_(winter)_(fire_emblem)","body":"Tag used for [[Nino (Fire Emblem)|]] from [[Fire Emblem]], specifically when dressed in her winter attire from the [[Fire Emblem Heroes]] 2019 \"Glorious Gifts\":[https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Glorious_Gifts_(Focus)] banner.\r\n\r\nCan typically be identified thanks to the attire's characteristics: a red [[fur trim]] [[dress]] with a green [[christmas tree]] pattern at the end, a [[santa hat]] with. a green and black [[ribbon]] with a [[bell]], a white [[belt]] with a [[satchel]], and a large [[sack]] on her back.\r\n\r\nMay be depicted holding her weapon: a small [[christmas tree]] decorated with [[christmas ornaments]] and a [[star (symbol)|]] on top.\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible (especially for older artwork), to depict Nino in a winter outfit without it being the one described above, in which case this tag should not be used.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["winter_nino","christmas_nino","nino_(christmas)_(fire_emblem)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":155018,"created_at":"2022-12-21T16:14:58.936-05:00","updated_at":"2025-05-17T20:54:25.152-04:00","title":"chrom_(gifted_leader)_(fire_emblem)","body":"Tag used for [[Chrom (Fire Emblem)]] from [[Fire Emblem]] specifically when dressed in his winter attire from the [[Fire Emblem Heroes]] 2017 \"Winter's Envoy\":[https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Winter's_Envoy_(Focus)] banner.\r\n\r\nCan typically be identified thanks to the attire's characteristics: A red [[sleeveless shirt]] with [[gold trim]], a red and white [[cape]], brown [[gloves]] with white ends, a green and white [[ribbon]] across the chest with a [[star (symbol)|]]-shaped clasp, a [[santa costume|santa hat]], and a white [[sack]].\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible (especially for older artwork), to depict Chrom in a winter outfit without it being the one described above, in which case this tag should not be used.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["winter_chrom","santa_chrom","christmas_chrom","chrom_(christmas)_(fire_emblem)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":155145,"created_at":"2022-12-23T10:42:03.606-05:00","updated_at":"2025-05-17T20:54:05.893-04:00","title":"sanaki_kirsch_altina_(winter)","body":"Tag used for [[Sanaki Kirsch Altina]] from [[Fire Emblem]], specifically when dressed in her winter attire from the [[Fire Emblem Heroes]] 2020 \"A Festival Miracle\":[https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/A_Festival_Miracle_(Focus)] banner.\r\n\r\nCan typically be identified thanks to the attire's characteristics: a white [[dress]] with a red [[banner]] layered over it, a red [[cape]] with [[tassels]] that is green on the inside, a green [[headband]] with a [[star (symbol)|]] in the center, a green and yellow [[ribbon]] around her neck, and red [[gloves]].

A [[apex legends mobile|smartphone port]] developed in collaboration with Tencent's LightSpeed Studios was released in 2022, though it ultimately shut down in 2023. The port was treated as a separate game entirely and featured exclusive cosmetics and legends.\r\n\r\nIt quickly gained mass popularity, rivaling contemporaries such as [[Overwatch]], [[Playerunknown's Battlegrounds|PUBG]] & [[Fortnite]] in player & streaming view count. The game is notably very popular in Japan, where first-person shooters typically have difficulty finding a large following. It is the favorite game of many [[virtual YouTuber]]s and eSports players, with both [[Hololive]]/[[Holostars]] and [[Nijisanji]] having several talents who dedicate most of their stream time to playing it.\r\n\r\nDespite not featuring the parkour and mecha elements of the main series, Apex Legends is considered a canon part of the [[Titanfall (series)|]] franchise. Due to how it's largely treated as a separate entity with its own spin-offs, the Titanfall series tag should not be added to Apex posts unless there's a direct reference beyond the shared weapons.\r\n\r\nh4.

The film stars [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Michael Fassbender]], Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green and Charlize Theron. \r\n\r\nSet in the late 21st century, the story centers on the crew of the [[spacecraft]] Prometheus as they follow a star map discovered among the remnants of several ancient Earth civilizations. Led to a distant world and an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the crew seeks the origins of humanity, but instead discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe film began development in the early 2000s as a fifth entry in the Alien franchise, with both Scott and director [[James Cameron]] developing ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science fiction horror film [[alien (1979)|Alien]]. James Cameron eventually left the project to focus in his sci-fi film [[avatar (2009 movie)|Avatar]].\r\n\r\nBy late 2010, Ridley Scott brought Lindelof onto the project to rewrite Spaihts' script, and together they developed a separate story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, though the film shares \"strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak\", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe and June 8, 2012 in the United States and Canada.
