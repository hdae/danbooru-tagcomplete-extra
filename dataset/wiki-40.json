Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres that range from Electronic music, Industrial Rock, Industrial Metal, Alternative Rock and Dark Ambient.\r\n\r\nAfter recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. \r\n\r\nReznor produced several highly influential records in the 90s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits. Two Nine Inch Nails recordings have won Grammy Awards and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 30 million albums worldwide, with 11 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\r\n\r\nTrent Reznor has also created musical scores for several [[video game]]s and movies. [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] (2011) film musical score by Reznor won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. \r\n\r\nSince 1989, Nine Inch Nails has made nine major studio releases, which are called \"Halos\".\r\n\r\nh4.NIN Discography\r\n\r\n* Pretty Hate Machine (1989)\r\n* Broken (EP) (1992) - 2 Grammy awards for \"Wish\" and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\", Best Metal Performance, 1992 and 1995 (Woodstock '94 compilation)\r\n* [[The Downward Spiral]] (1994)\r\n* [[The Fragile]] (1999)\r\n* With Teeth (2005)\r\n* Year Zero (2007)\r\n* Ghosts I–IV (2008)\r\n* The Slip (2008)\r\n* Hesitation Marks (2013)\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Quake 1]]\r\n* [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["NIN","NIИ","ナイン・インチ・ネイルズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":219023,"created_at":"2024-12-16T12:40:52.745-05:00","updated_at":"2024-12-16T12:40:52.745-05:00","title":"pump_(font)","body":"A sans-serif font created in 1970 by Bob Newman.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":219022,"created_at":"2024-12-16T12:33:57.474-05:00","updated_at":"2024-12-16T12:33:57.474-05:00","title":"balloon_(font)","body":"A font created in 1939 by Max R.

It seemed that no one was able to meet the criteria until his son Kazuya, thought dead, confronted him. In an ironic twist, Kazuya defeated Heihachi and threw him off the same cliff, making him the new CEO of the Mishima Zaibatsu.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent releases, Heihachi was often seen being killed by several powerful opponents, only to survive and return in the next game to exact revenge.

Typical Japanese women's clothing at the time, however, was more showy and elaborate than modest or functional. As a result, this style quickly rose in popularity as a more practical alternative for women attending school. Even in the present day, it is traditional attire for women at some college graduation ceremonies, \"as seen here\":[https://ganbaregenki.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/hakama2.jpg?w=640].\r\n\r\nDespite the name of the tag, this is [i]not[/i] explicitly worn by schoolgirls, and it is [i]not[/i] restricted to depictions of the Meiji era (especially since the style remained popular into the Taisho era).\r\n\r\nAlthough this outfit looks quite similar to some types of traditional Japanese [[waitress]] attire, the two should not be confused with one another (Although [[Bashamichi|in some cases]], it may be difficult). As a rule of thumb, if the girl in question is wearing [[tasuki]] or has rolled-up/pushed-up sleeves, then these may be indicators of a waitress uniform (as well as less-subtle signs such as [[name tag]]s, [[menu]]s, serving trays, etc.)\r\n\r\nh4.

It was produced by [[Big West]] Advertising and [[JVC]].\r\n\r\nThe movie is a film adaptation of [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross]], with new improved animation and designs. The storyline of the movie does not fit directly into the Macross chronology, and was originally an alternate-universe retelling of the story, but was later established as part of the [[Macross]] universe. \r\n\r\nWithin the Macross continuity it is also a popular movie (ie. a movie within a television series), a fact shown in [[Macross 7]]. However, other Macross sequels like [[Macross Frontier]] have used visual elements from both the first T.V. series and this animated film.\r\n\r\nIn [[real life]] the premier of this anime film adaptation in Japan during the mid [[1980s_(style)|80s]] was a great success. It received a huge marketing campaign that generated very long lines of fans; many of them camped outside cinemas the night prior to the movie's first release (something unheard of at the time for an anime related work).

It was the largest [[artillery]] piece ever fielded in combat, as well as the largest artillery by caliber size to enter service.\r\n\r\nOriginally intended to counter the French's Maginot line of fortifications, the gun never saw use during the Battle of France due to the German army simply outflanking the line and ignoring the defense almost entirely. The gun later saw service as anti-fortification artillery on the Eastern Front.\r\n\r\nThe artillery was incredibly powerful, and was capable of defeating with one hit any fortification in existence at the time. However its deployment was hampered by the immense amount of resources, time and personnel it needed to operate. It weighed over 1,350 tons and required over 2,500 servicemen just to lay down the track and prepare its firing position. It also had a very poor rate of fire of one or two shots per [i]hour[/i].\r\n\r\nTwo of these railway guns were built; the first was named \"Schwerer Gustav\" while the second was named \"Dora\".

The accretion, loss, and recovery of souls are central to the narrative and gameplay of Dark Souls games. These games are linked through their setting and an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire.

It is currently marketed by Mattel.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players discard cards matching the color or number/symbol of the card on a discard pile. Certain action cards call the next color to play, reverse the direction of play, force the next player to draw a certain number of cards, or forfeit the next player's turn altogether. A player has to shout \"Uno\" (Spanish/Italian for \"one\") to warn other players they are down to their last card; a round ends when a player runs out of cards. Points are scored by adding values of the other players' cards and awarded to the player that ran out.\r\n\r\nOne popular house rule (not an official rule) is to counter a \"Draw 2/4\" card by playing a similar \"Draw 2/4\" card, thus \"stacking\" the number of cards the following player has to draw.\r\n\r\nh4.
