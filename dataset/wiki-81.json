The war was triggered by Ba'athist [[Iraq]]'s invasion and annexation of [[Kuwait]], which was seen as a threat to the security of the neighboring countries and the global oil supply.\r\n\r\nA coalition of 34 countries, led by the [[United States]], formed to oppose [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq's aggression and to liberate Kuwait. The coalition included several Arab countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], as well as Western countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Canada]]. The coalition launched a massive military operation to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, known as Operation Desert Storm.\r\n\r\nThe war began with a series of air strikes on Iraqi military targets, followed by a ground offensive. The coalition forces achieved a quick and decisive victory, and Kuwait was liberated from Iraqi occupation. The war lasted for less than six months, with the majority of the fighting taking place between January and February 1991.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf War had significant political, economic, and social consequences. It marked a turning point in the global politics of the Middle East, as well as in the use of military force to resolve international disputes. The war also had a severe impact on the civilian population, with thousands of Kuwaiti civilians and Iraqi civilians being killed or displaced.\r\n\r\nThe war also led to the imposition of sanctions on Iraq, which remained in place for over a decade, and had a significant impact on the country's economy and population. Additionally, the Gulf War led to the deployment of US military forces in the region, which has had a lasting impact on the politics and security of the Middle East.\r\n\r\nh4.

He is a memorable character, not only infamous for his girl-like [[ponytail]] and battle cries, but also for the [[Claw (weapon)|]] he wields, with his unique fighting style. Vega uses his own fighting style of which is a blend of Spanish Ninjutsu and Bullfighting. \r\n\r\nVega was born to a noble family in Barcelona, [[Spain]]. As he matured, Vega studied [[Bullfighting]], a cultural tradition amongst the nobles. Afterward, he went to Japan and learned Ninjutsu, a style he believed meshed well with his natural grace and agility. Returning home, Vega combined Bullfighting with Ninjutsu and went into an underground cage fighting circuit where quickly became one of the best. Tragedy struck one day when Vega witnessed the murder of his beautiful mother at the hands of his unattractive stepfather. Her murder was punishment for disrespecting him as his stepfather believed. Witnessing this tragic event warped Vega's mind and from then on he lived a double life; a suave nobleman by day and a narcissistic killer by night who enjoys mutilating ugly people to death using a three-pronged wrist-mounted razor-sharp claw. His very first victim was his stepfather.\r\n\r\nVega's brutal fighting skills and remorseless nature impressed the criminal leader known as [[M.

[b]Leyte Open Sea Naval Battle[/b]) was the [b]largest naval battle of [[World War II]][/b] and by some criteria [b]the largest naval battle in history[/b], with over 200,000 naval personnel involved. It was fought in waters near the [[Philippines]] islands of Leyte, Samar, and Luzon from 23 to 26 October 1944 between combined [[united_states|American]] and [[Australia]]n forces and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), as part of the [b]Allied invasion of Leyte[/b], which aimed to isolate Japan from the colonies that it had occupied in Southeast Asia, a vital source of industrial and oil supplies.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the battle, [[Japan]] had much fewer capital ships ([[aircraft carrier]]s and [[battleship]]s) left than the Allied forces had total aircraft carriers in the Pacific, which underscored the disparity in force strength at that point in the war. Regardless, the IJN mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion, but it was repulsed by the US Navy's Third and Seventh Fleets.\r\n\r\nThe battle consisted of four main separate engagements (the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Cape Engaño, and the Battle off Samar), as well as lesser actions. Allied forces announced the end of organized Japanese resistance on the island at the end of December.\r\n\r\nIt was also the [b]first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized [[kamikaze pilot]] attacks[/b] (which were deadly effective and sunk many Allied ships), and it was the [b]last naval battle between battleships in history[/b]. The battle ended in a decisive [[victory]] for the Allies. The Japanese Navy suffered heavy losses and never sailed in comparable force thereafter since it was stranded for lack of fuel in its bases for the rest of the war.\r\n\r\nh4.

Appearance\r\nShe has [[long_hair|long]] [[black hair]] with [[tress_ribbon|red tress ribbons]] and [[red eyes]]. Some art makes light on how she essentially looks like a black-haired [[murakumo (kancolle)|Murakumo]] and a pixiv tag is dedicated to how she looks like a tiny [[nagato (kancolle)|Nagato]].\r\n\r\nShe wears a [[long_sleeves|long-sleeved]] white and blue [[serafuku]] with a yellow scarf on top of the standard Kagerou-class [[pleated skirt]], [[white gloves]] & [[uneven legwear|socks of different lengths]]. She [[dual_wielding|dual wields]] two pistols, one based from a standard 12.7cm twin gun and another is a collection of AA guns. On her back is her rigging. Unlike her sisters, it was made into a style similar to some larger ships' split bow. On her right is the part corresponding to her sisters' rigging with an additional 12.7 gun and a quadruple torpedo launcher attached to it and to her left is a depth charge launcher with another torpedo launcher attached to it.\r\n\r\nIn her remodel, her scarf has been changed to a rope, her thighhigh gains a stripe, the Standard 12.7cm guns have been replaced by their High-Angle equivalent, a radar has been propped behind her head and finally, camo-textures are added to her uniform.\r\n\r\nFor her B remodel (which is [i]not[/i] an actual second remodel), she is essentially the same as in her remodel except for her use of long 10cm guns. While she is now significantly more powerful stats-wise, the portrait serves as an art refresher.\r\n\r\nh4. Personality\r\nLike Nagato, she has a straightforward and professional personality with great pride in her fighting abilities. Perhaps because of this, she prefers a frontal and aggressive approach in battle rather than to engage in defensive measures.\r\n\r\nIt is implied in her hourlies that she is the only one in her division with poor culinary skills. At 0700, she said that [[hamakaze (kancolle)|Hamakaze]] told her how to make breakfast for the admiral but it ended in failure. At 1200, Tanikaze made the rice balls they ate at that time. At 1800, she ends up cooking with Urakaze. At 2000, it is revealed Urakaze made custard while Isokaze made grilled fish. The next hourlie implies that Urakaze's dish was better than Isokaze's. This has been exaggerated to the point that, if she and [[hiei (kancolle)|Hiei]] are allowed to cook together, they will produce something that is multiplicatively worse than if the two are allowed to cook separately.\r\n\r\nDue to her blunt personality, Isokaze is often depicted by fans as either being oblivious to her poor performance or simply being a narcisstic. Because of this, she is frequently depicted in ecchi/NSFW works as being more seasoned in sexual matters or simply viewing it as another form of competition. Alternatively, others have also depicted her in the more ladylike demeanour.\r\n\r\nShe is voiced by [[Kawasumi Ayako]], who also voices [[ooyodo (kancolle)|Ooyodo]], [[unryuu (kancolle)|Unryuu]], [[kamikaze (kancolle)|Kamikaze]] and the [[Midway Princess]]. Isokaze, in particular, shares a voice identical to [[Saber (fate)|]], who incidentally has much in common with her.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n* [[Isokaze (Azur Lane)]]\r\n\r\nh5.

The [[yamato_(battleship)|Yamato-class ships]] were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing almost 72,000 long tons (73,000 t) fully loaded and armed with nine 460-millimetre (18.1 in) main guns. Their secondary armament consisted of four 155-millimetre (6.1 in) triple-gun turrets formerly used by the Mogami-class cruisers. They were equipped with six or seven armed floatplanes to conduct reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nCommissioned in mid-1942, Musashi was modified to serve as the flagship of the Kidou Butai (Combined Fleet) during [[World War II]], and spent the rest of the year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk, Japan's main wartime naval base in the South Pacific theatre, in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. \r\n\r\nShe was present during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. During the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944. Over half of her crew was rescued. \r\n\r\nHer wreck was located in March 2015 by a team of researchers employed by [[Microsoft]] co-founder Paul Allen.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["戦艦武蔵","武蔵"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":178594,"created_at":"2023-12-04T02:30:11.947-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-04T02:30:11.947-05:00","title":"ruda_(puyopuyo)","body":"[i]A girl born in a snowy country known for it's intense cold.
