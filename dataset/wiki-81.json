The Levin has fixed-headlights, and the Trueno has retractable headlights, both could be hatchback or coupe.

While the AE85 shares its chassis and basic design with the famous AE86, the AE85 was designed for economy and differs mainly in its engine, compared to the AE86, which was designed for performance.\r\n\r\nThe white and black color variant (informally known as the \"panda\" Trueno) is most known as [[Fujiwara Takumi]]'s [[fujiwara takumi's toyota trueno ae86|'Tofu Delivery' car]] from the [[Initial D]] series, while [[Takeuchi Itsuki]] purchases an AE85 Levin, mistaken for an AE86.
