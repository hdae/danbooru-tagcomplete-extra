It is intended to function as a stealth air superiority fighter / multirole combat aircraft and has the potential to be a capable, long-range strike system in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\n\r\nAs of early July 2023, approximately 200-250 airframes have been produced. Compared with other current fifth generation aircraft, the J-20 is unique because of its bigger size -which implies bigger fuel tanks and therefore a longer operational range- and its adoption of [[canards]]. \r\n\r\nh4.
