It was Tomino's attempt to launch a new U.C. Gundam saga, set 30 years after [[Char's Counterattack]]. He re-teamed with character designer [[Yasuhiko Yoshikazu]] and [[mecha]] designer [[Ookawara Kunio]]  for the occasion.\r\n\r\nOriginally planned as a full-length television series, Gundam F91 hit a production snag due to staff disputes, and the project was stopped after the screenplays for the first thirteen episodes were written. It was then decided that what was made of the show would be condensed into a theatrical feature. The film was first released in [[Japan]] on March 16, 1991.\r\n\r\nSet in [b]U.C. 0123[/b] (44 years after [[mobile_suit_gundam|the original Gundam]]), the story of Gundam F91 revolves around teenage space colonist [[Seabook Arno]], his girlfriend [[Cecily Fairchild]], and the efforts of the [[Crossbone Vanguard]] militia to establish an aristocracy known as \"Cosmo Babylonia\". In keeping with Gundam tradition, the civilian Seabook is forced by circumstance to pilot the [[F91 Gundam]], coincidentally designed in part by his estranged mother, Dr. [[Monica Arno]].\r\n\r\nChronologically continued by [[Crossbone Gundam]] and [[Victory Gundam]].\r\n\r\nh4.
