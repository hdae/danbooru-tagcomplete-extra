He either self-imposes or is imposed with the behavioral conduct of a military man who complies with others' wills. As a result of that, in the past there were many who relied on him for power, which also resulted in many toying with his determination. But over in Ikebukuro where Fergus's memories and experiences are suitable for him, he seems to be glorifying the life of a student. Perhaps of his role as a prophet, there are occasions where he glimpses at fragments of memories of times not set in the present. Every time the pain that springs back up from the difference between love and friendship reappears, he repeats his misunderstanding as he wonders if it is some kind of vision. He is a man whose constant catchphrase is \"youth\" and sees dreams of an adolescence he cannot return to. He holds good will towards those who honor a single choice like he does. He has a strange, frequent connection to the number seven, the number before eight. Since he's lost a part of the memory of the person known as Fergus and their role, he often just calls himself mac Roich.\r\n\r\nh4.

What are artists?\r\n\r\nAn artist in Danbooru represents the person who created a piece of art. Danbooru's artist database tracks extra information about artists, including the websites they use and alternate names they're known under.\r\n\r\nh4. How do artist entries differ from tags?\r\n\r\nFor starters, artist entries list all websites or artist profiles that are associated with the artist. Danbooru uses these URLs to automatically identify the artist tag for new uploads, so it's very important to include this information.\r\n\r\nArtists can also have multiple \"other\" names associated with them. Typically this includes the artist's Japanese name. Notes allow one to list other extraneous details.\r\n\r\nArtist entries are also used to organize artists that are part of doujin circles. A circle is represented as an artist entry that has multiple group members.\r\n\r\nh4. How do I search for artists?\r\n\r\nStart at the \"index\":/artists. In addition to browsing through the entire artist list, you can also search for artist by name or by URL.\r\n\r\nBy default, Danbooru will search across names, other names, and group names using exact string matching. You can do wildcard searching with \"*\". For example, searching for \"bol*\" will return any artist whose name starts with \"bol\".\r\n\r\nIf you only want to search the name field, prefix your query with [i]name:[/i] like [i]name:john.[/i] [i]group:[/i] and [i]other:[/i] work similarly.\r\n\r\nSuppose you know the artist's homepage, but can't figure out their name. Simply search for the URL (beginning with http) and Danbooru will return any associated artists.\r\n\r\nh4. How do I create an artist?\r\n\r\nFirst off, go \"here\":/artists/new. Second, [[howto:artist|search name and fill artist page]].\r\n\r\nYou'll see five fields. [b]Name[/b] is self-explanatory. [b]Other Names[/b] are for any miscellaneous names or identities the artist has, separated by commas. For example, you can place the artist's name in kanji or kana in this field. [b]Group[/b] is the name of the group or circle this artist belongs to. [b]Notes[/b] are for any extra tidbits of information you want to mention (this field is actually saved to the artist's matching wiki page on Danbooru).\r\n\r\nThe URLs field is a list of URLs associated with the artist, like their home page, their blog, and any servers that store the artist's images. Separate URLs with newlines or spaces.\r\n\r\nh4. What is a banned artist?\r\n\r\nArtists may request that all their works to be removed from the site. When this happens, the artist is marked as banned. New uploads by a banned artist will be taken down automatically.\r\n\r\nSee [[banned artist]] for the full list of banned artists.\r\n\r\nh4. Are artists tied to tags?\r\n\r\nNo. If you create an artist-typed tag, a corresponding artist is not automatically created. If you create an artist but no corresponding tag, searching for posts by that artist won't return any results.\r\n\r\nYou can think of the artist database as separate from the tags database.\r\n\r\nThis is an intentional design decision. By keeping the two separated, users have far more freedom when it comes to creating aliases, groups, and edits.\r\n\r\nh4. When I search for a URL, I get a bunch of unrelated results. What's going on?\r\n\r\nShort answer: this is just a side-effect of the way Danbooru searches URLs. Multiple results typically mean Danbooru couldn't find the artist.\r\n\r\nLong answer: when you're searching for a URL, typically it's a URL to an image on the artist's site. If this is a new image, querying this will obviously return no results.\r\n\r\nSo what Danbooru does is progressively chop off directories from the URL. http://site.com/a/b/c.jpg becomes http://site.com/a/b becomes http://site.com/a becomes http://site.com. It keeps doing this until a match is found. Danbooru does this more than once because there are cases where the URL is nested by date, like in http://site.com/2007/06/05/image.jpg. Usually this algorithm works very well, provided the artist has an entry in the database.\r\n\r\nIf they do not, then the algorithm is probably going to cut the URL down to just the domain, e.g. http://geocities.co.jp. When this happens, you'll sometimes get every artist hosted on that domain.\r\n\r\nWhy not just dump all the results if you get more than one? Well, there are a few cases when multiple artists validly map to the same domain. Usually the domain is just being used to host files or something.\r\n\r\nh4. Is there an API?\r\n\r\nYes. The artist controller uses the same interface as the rest of Danbooru. See the [[help:api|API documentation]] for details.\r\n\r\nh4.

You can see your current upload limit on your \"profile page\":[/profile] or on the \"upload page\":[/uploads/new].\r\n\r\nYour upload limit controls how many {{status:pending}} or {{status:appealed}} posts you can have in the [[about:mod queue|moderation queue]] at once. For example, if you have an upload limit of 15, then you can have 15 {{status:pending}} posts at once. When you reach your limit, you can't upload more until your existing uploads are either approved or deleted.\r\n\r\nNew uploaders should be careful about uploading too many posts at once. If you run out of upload slots, you may have to wait up to 3 days for your posts to be deleted before you can upload again.\r\n\r\nh4. Rules\r\n\r\nHere's how the system works:\r\n\r\n* Each {{status:pending}} post takes up one upload slot.\r\n* Each {{status:appealed}} post takes up three upload slots.\r\n* If any of your uploads are manually deleted in under three days ({{status:deleted age:<3d}}), they take up five upload slots.\r\n* Slots are freed when uploads are approved, or after three days if they are not approved.\r\n* You start out with 15 upload slots and can have between 5 and 40 upload slots.\r\n* You gain and lose slots based on approvals and deletions:\r\n** You lose a slot for every 3 deletions.\r\n** You gain a slot for every N approved uploads, where N depends on how many slots you already have:\r\n*** If you have 15 slots or less, then you gain a slot for every 10 approved uploads.\r\n*** If you have more than 15 slots, then you need 10 approvals, plus 2 more per upload slot over 15.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have 15 upload slots, then you need 10 approvals for the next slot. If you have 16 slots, then you need 12 approvals. If you have 17 slots, you need 14 approvals, and so on. The number of approvals you need goes up by 2 every level.\r\n\r\nAt the maximum level you can have 40 upload slots. To reach this level you will need at least 900 approved uploads and an average deletion ratio of less than 5%.\r\n\r\nh4. Contributors\r\n\r\nContributor-level users and above ([[help:users]]) have no upload limit. You may be granted this privilege by consistently uploading high-quality posts while maintaining a low deletion ratio. The general criteria for Contributor level is having 1000 uploads and having a recent deletion ratio of around 5% or lower, though users with very few deleted posts might be promoted at lower thresholds.\r\n\r\nh4.

It is best known as an alternative to [[Twitter]] for posting NSFW art, especially [[loli]], [[shota]], and [[toddlercon]].\r\n\r\nOn pawoo (and other instances of Mastodon), 'tweets' are referred to as 'toots', 'likes' are referred to as 'favorites' and 'retweets' are referred to as 'boosts'.\r\n\r\nThis page will describe how to sign up and upload from Pawoo, in addition to how to handle new artist entries in the case an entry doesn't already exist for the artist you're uploading a work from.\r\n\r\nh4. Word of caution\r\n\r\nUploading from pawoo is unadvised for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* All jpg images are resampled (albeit at a lower rate than Twitter)\r\n* All images are currently configured to be resized to a maximum of 1280x1280, much smaller than what Twitter allows.\r\n\r\nYou should always look for a better image source off another site such as pixiv or nicoseiga if it is available ([[help:image source]]).\r\n\r\nh4.

That includes links like these:\r\n\r\n* https://pawoo.net/web/accounts/8525\r\n* https://pawoo.net/web/statuses/33721\r\n\r\nThe interface now has an English interface that also allows you to sign up with your pixiv account, so signing up should be fairly straightforward.\r\n\r\nh4.

The link to a toot should look something like this:\r\n\r\n* https://pawoo.net/@maaya/33721\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the HTML URL to the toot is much more preferred than that of the direct image URL to the tweet for various reasons. Artist information and commentary, for example, are readily available to pull from the image source if the tweet has not been taken down yet.\r\n\r\nThe upload page will [b]NOT[/b] always correct your source to the HTML link for you.

Uploading\r\n\r\nThe uploading process has been simplified for ArtStation. Upload with the \"danbooru bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], or paste in the URL of the work you wish to upload in the upload page. This way, you don't have to upload the image from your computer and risk it being an [[image sample]]. If you wish to upload a project with multiple images, the batch bookmarklet will make this much easier.\r\n\r\nIf after uploading the source is a direct image URL or blank, it should be changed to the HTML URL of the work. There are two types of HTML URL pages for projects on ArtStation. The www version represents the main site, in addition to pages based on a custom domain name for the artist. On the custom domain name gallery, the artist can make some images available not on the www gallery. Either URL should technically work and detect artist names, however the artist subdomain is able to be changed. Below is an example of a preferred source:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/EJ6Jn\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nYou can observe that the alternative URL structure is simply borrowed from the other by comparing them, as shown below by the same project on the different pages.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nhttps://deel.artstation.com/projects/EJ6Jn\r\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/EJ6Jn\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nUse the artist tag detected under [b]Related Tags[/b], if there is one.

Artist naming and entry\r\n\r\nIf there are no other active accounts on which an artist posts, the name listed in their profile will usually be sufficient for their artist name. If their ArtStation account has been found linked from one their other accounts such as DeviantArt or Pixiv than their ArtStation URLs (seen below) should be appended to their existing artist entry. See \"Artist tagging help\":/forum_topics/8199 thread if you are unsure or think an artist name should be changed.\r\n\r\nThere are two URLs for an ArtStation artist that should be included in their artist entry list of URLs. One starts with www and the other is a customization subdomain. Unlike Pixiv however direct links to images should not be included. Below is an example for one artist:\r\n* https://www.artstation.com/geosiador\r\n* https://geosiador.artstation.com/\r\n\r\n[b]Note[/b]: Artists on ArtStation are able to edit their usernames on the site. When this happens both the above URLs will change and should subsequently be added to their artist entry, however the old ones should not be removed.\r\n\r\nSometimes an artists other accounts may be listed in the About subheading on their ArtStation profile. This could help find an existing artist entry or should be appended to the artist's URL list.\r\n\r\nh4. Legacy \"/original/\" files\r\nAt its launch, ArtStation had higher-resolution or quality version of images sometimes available. This allowed users to sometimes upload much higher quality versions of images form the source. Many images uploaded prior to suspension of this file thankfully remain on Danbooru as legacy content from that time, despite no longer being available from ArtStation.

Artist naming\r\n\r\nRule of thumb is: Make a [b]simple, readable, and memorizable[/b] tag.\r\n\r\nThe first choice is to use the artist's real name if you can find it on any websites or blogs listed on their nijie profile. See [[howto:artist]] for advice on finding the artist's name on their website.\r\n\r\nMany artists also have [[pixiv]] accounts in addition to their Nijie account. Refer to [[howto:pixiv]] for more information in the case you find one.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a name, [[howto:romanize|romanize it]]. Name kanji often have several different readings, so it's best to use any available indicators (such as their twitter handle) on how to read the name. If you don't know how to read this name or are unsure of the correct reading, post in topic #8199 to ask for help.\r\n\r\nNote that Nijie nicknames are not necessarily unique. If it is too generic (\"Ken\", \"Daisuke\", \"Youko\", etc.), add a qualifier to make it unique. Good choices for qualifiers include:\r\n\r\n* The artist's circle name\r\n** e.g. [[gurande_(g-size)]]\r\n* The artist's twitter handle\r\n** e.g. [[oyamada_(pi0v0jg)]]\r\n* If nothing else exists, their nijie ID\r\n** This is a very rare case, and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nh5. Things to note\r\n\r\n* [b]Do not[/b] use non-ASCII characters for the artist's name, even if they look like ASCII letters--Ｒｙｕ is not the same as Ryu. Save that for the \"Other names\" field.\r\n* [b]Do not[/b] use \"_(nijie)\" or \"_(artist)\" as the qualifier. There are probably a dozen Nijie artists named Sakura or Miki, so those qualifiers are simply not effective.\r\n* [b]Try not to[/b] make a hard to read name like [[ken_(oooxvbgj)]].\r\n\r\nh4. Artist entries\r\n\r\nTo create or edit an artist entry, click the '?' next to the artist tag in the tag list. In the artist entry, add:\r\n\r\nh6.

Pooling\r\n\r\nIf you upload most or all of a comic, artbook, or doujinshi from e-Hentai, you should group your uploads into a pool.

If not, follow the rest of this howto to create a new artist tag.\r\n\r\n* Do a [[help:cheatsheet|source:*username* search]] for the DeviantArt username. The username is usually found in image source URL.

You will need to update the artist entry so that Danbooru will automatically detect the artist tag for future uploads. See [b]Artist Entries[/b] to learn how to do this.\r\n* If this search didn't turn up any posts, or you find posts but they don't have an artist tag, then you will have to make a new artist tag yourself. Edit the post and add [b]artist:artist_name[/b] to the tags. See [b]Artist Naming[/b] for advice on choosing a name. After making a new artist tag, you will also have to create an artist entry. See [b]Artist Entries[/b] to learn how to do this.\r\n\r\nh4. Artist Naming\r\n\r\nThe first choice is to use the artist's full real name, if you can find it. On the main profile under the artist's username, there should be a section that shows the artist's real name, gender, and location. The name should have both a first and a last name. If it's in non-English letters, follow Danbooru's [[howto:romanize|romanization guidelines]]. Otherwise, check any personal websites or blogs they may list in their DeviantArt profile. See [[howto:artist]] for advice on finding the artist's name on their website.\r\n\r\nThe second choice is their DeviantArt username.\r\n\r\nh4. Artist Entries\r\n\r\nAfter creating a new artist tag, click the '?' next to the artist tag in the tag list to create a new artist entry. In the artist entry add:\r\n\r\nh6.

A background process runs once per day to refresh your tag subscriptions providing you a listing of the 200 most recent posts matching your searches. You can think of a tag subscription as a bookmark to a tag search, but coupled with the full power of Danbooru's tag query engine.\r\n\r\nYou can create up to five groups and each group can have up to 20 searches. Any search that works in the post listing will work with tag subscriptions, which means any metatag will work. You can even create tag subscriptions based on other people's tag subscriptions.\r\n\r\nYou can search your own tag subscriptions using the sub: metatag from the main post listing. To search for albert's tag subscriptions for example, search for [i]sub:albert[/i]. To search albert's touhou tag subscription group, you can search for [i]sub:albert:touhou[/i]. Because the posts are rendered through the main listing, you can also view the Atom feed, the Piclens feed, and all API calls will work as expected. And like any other metatag, you can combine it with other tags (to a degree).\r\n\r\nEach search should go on a separate line. So if you put two tags on the same line, it will only match posts with both those tags. But if you put two tags on separate lines, it will match posts with either of the two tags.\r\n\r\nTo edit your tag subscriptions, visit your \"tag subscriptions\":/tag_subscriptions page.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":5646,"created_at":"2007-08-09T13:22:32.022-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-12T19:01:23.728-04:00","title":"help:tag_scripts","body":"Tag scripts allow you to quickly add and remove tags to posts by clicking on their thumbnails.

If you append &c_mode=count to the end, you'll receive the number of results returned by that search instead of the results themselves. If you append &p={PAGE} you can change pages. There are 50 results per page.\r\n\r\nFor images that have been deleted (i.e., bad id), or if you query for a R-18 image but don't pass a valid PHPSESSID, the API returns a \"200 OK\" HTTP code but an empty response.  Private images (MyPicks, etc...) have an illust id of 0 and a generic thumbnail.\r\n\r\nResponses are unlabeled CSV documents.\r\n\r\n[expand=Example

are the standards concerning the various kinds of [i][[pokemon|Pokémon]][/i] tags.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging human characters\r\n\r\n* Use English names for human characters, with the (pokemon) qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[sabrina (pokemon)]], [[brock (pokemon)]], etc.\r\n* Use English names for trainer classes, with the (pokemon) qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[lass_(pokemon)]], [[swimmer_(pokemon)]], [[fisher_(pokemon)]], etc.\r\n* As an exception, human characters with surnames don't have the qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[tracey sketchit]], [[blue oak]], etc. (not [[blue_oak_(pokemon)]])\r\n\r\nPokemon tags were formerly partly grandfathered-in tags, where human characters were originally referred to by their Japanese names in compliance with usual Danbooru standards, despite having English names on exported versions. The English names were sometimes available as aliases, especially in the case of major characters such as players and rivals. However, as raised in topic #17160, this created an inconsistency with the use of the English names of the Pokemon themselves and other terms used in the franchise as well as several other factors that had to be addressed, thus the reversal, marking Pokemon tags as completely grandfathered-in copyright tags. See our [[howto:copyright|Copyright Tag Guidelines]] for more info about \"grandfathered-in copyright tags\".\r\n\r\nMost human characters are known by a single name (they lack a full name) such as \"Misty\" and would be likely ambiguous with characters from other copyrights, hence the (pokemon) qualifier.\r\n\r\nTrainer classes are often descriptive words such as \"Swimmer\" or \"Lass\", so English trainer classes are used. They would often clash with common English vocabulary, so the (pokemon) qualifier is used here as well.\r\n\r\nSee [[List of Pokemon characters]] for all names.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging Pokémon species\r\n\r\n* Simply use the English names of Pokémon species.\r\n** Ex.: [[pikachu]], [[mewtwo]], etc.\r\n* There are ten species that require the (pokemon) qualifier:\r\n** [[gloom_(pokemon)]], [[golem_(pokemon)]],  [[electrode_(pokemon)]], [[kabuto_(pokemon)]], [[mew_(pokemon)]], [[roselia_(pokemon)]],[[deino_(pokemon)]], [[chi-yu_(pokemon)]], [[ting-lu_(pokemon)]] and [[iron_hands_(pokemon)]].\r\n\r\n* For a regional form, use just \"alolan_(species)\", \"galarian_(species)\", \"hisuian_(species)\" or \"paldean_(species)\". Don't use just \"(species)\".\r\n** Ex.: Alolan Meowth should be tagged just [[alolan_meowth]], not [[meowth]].\r\n** Ex.: Galarian Meowth should be tagged just [[galarian_meowth]], not [[meowth]].\r\n** Ex.: Hisuian Braviary should be tagged just [[hisuian_braviary]], not [[braviary]].\r\n** Ex.: Paldean Wooper should be tagged just [[paldean_wooper]], not [[wooper]].\r\n\r\nOwing to their sheer number (1008 registered species, as of the Scarlet and Violet versions), remembering their English names is no easy task, much less their Japanese names. The Japanese names of Pokémon also cover many highly-ambiguous words that can and will conflict with other characters, artists, and objects. (Beedrill = \"Spear\" in Japanese; Magnemite = \"Coil\" in Japanese, etc.)\r\n\r\nHistorically, Japanese names had been applicable to newer Pokémon as temporary tags, when necessary, until their English names became officially available. However, in the latest generations, the English and Japanese names have been usually released at the same time.\r\n\r\nSome miscellaneous tags about Pokémon species, such as [[shiny_pokemon]] and [[clothed_pokemon]], are also available.\r\n\r\nSee [[list_of_pokemon|List of Pokémon]] for all names.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging media\r\n\r\n* Use game tags to group human characters and designs from various games.\r\n** Ex.: [[pokemon_rgby]], [[pokemon_sm]], [[pokemon_swsh]], etc.\r\n* Use anime series tags to group human characters and designs from different anime series.\r\n** Ex.: [[pokemon_(classic_anime)]], [[pokemon_dppt_(anime)]], [[pokemon_sm_(anime)]], etc.\r\n* Other media tags are available as well:\r\n** Ex.: [[pokemon adventures]], [[pokemon pocket monsters]], etc.\r\n* Make sure to check the different designs of each character to see where it fits.\r\n** Ex.: Red is visibly different in [i]RGBY[/i], [i]FRLG[/i], [i]SM[/i] and [i]LGPE[/i], so various posts depicting Red are expected to have different media tags. Many game characters also have different designs when they appear in remakes.\r\n* In the vast majority of cases, don't use game tags for Pokémon species.\r\n** Ex.: Posts depicting a Squirtle should not be tagged [[pokemon_rgby]]. (unless there are human characters from that game in the post as well) All the same, posts depicting a [[Wooloo]] should not be tagged [[pokemon_swsh]].\r\n* As an exception, [[official art]] posts depicting a Pokémon may use game tags.\r\n** Ex.: Official art of Charizard from FRLG may be tagged [[pokemon_frlg]]. Official art of Wooloo from SwSh may be tagged [[pokemon_swsh]].\r\n\r\nA post depicting a Pokémon species is not necessarily a visible reference to any game in particular.\r\n\r\nFor instance, adding [[pokemon_swsh]] to a Wooloo post (post #3528342) would be a mistake, because Wooloo is expected to appear in other media as well.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: topic #15030.\r\n\r\nSee [[List of Pokemon media]] for all forms of media.\r\n\r\nh4. Prototype Pokémon\r\n\r\nPrototype Pokémon are the unused Pokémon designs and creatures. They sometimes appear in fan art.\r\n\r\n* All prototype Pokémon have their own tags and don't use normal Pokémon tags. Examples:\r\n** post #3360231 - the correct tag is [[girafarig_(prototype)]], not [[girafarig]].\r\n** post #3355587 - the correct tag is [[gyarados_(prototype)]], not [[gyarados]].\r\n** post #3148107 - the correct tag is [[rai_(raikou)]], not [[raikou]].\r\n** post #3148591 - the correct tag is [[leafy_(leafeon)]], not [[leafeon]].\r\n* Prototype versions having the same names as normal Pokémon have the (prototype) qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[igglybuff_(prototype)]] (to distinguish from the normal [[igglybuff]]), [[gyarados_(prototype)]], [[pichu_(prototype)]], [[girafarig_(prototype)]], etc.\r\n* Whenever possible, use a name found in official sources (which are usually in Japanese).\r\n** Ex.: Some prototype Pokémon have been found, with their respective names, in the [i]Gold[/i]/[i]Silver[/i] from Space World 1997: Hanamogura, Honooguma, Volbear, Dynabear, etc.\r\n* Don't use fan translations as tags. Stick to the \"official\" Japanese names as said above. (sometimes fanart and fan sites use fan translations, but please ignore them) Feel free to mention major fan translations in the wiki pages (such as those by The Cutting Room Floor).\r\n** Ex.: The website The Cutting Room Floor translated the Pokémon names from Space World 1997: Koonya (original) became Meowsy (fan translation), Haneko (original) became Lefmew (fan translation), etc.\r\n* A prototype Pokémon is often found in a single game and is unlikely to appear in other games and media such as anime and manga, so it may use the normal game tag, as well as the prototype game tag.\r\n** Ex.: All posts depicting [[pichu_(prototype)]] should be tagged [[pokemon_gsc]], as well as [[pokemon_gsc_(prototype)]].\r\n\r\nLists of prototype Pokémon:\r\n\r\n* [[pokemon_rgby_(prototype)]]\r\n* [[pokemon_gsc_(prototype)]]\r\n* [[pokemon_rse_(prototype)]]\r\n* [[pokemon_dppt_(prototype)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":84940,"created_at":"2017-03-20T21:53:40.096-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-12T18:59:41.354-04:00","title":"howto:yandere","body":"\"Yande.re\":[https://yande.re] is an anime art board running \"Moebooru\":[https://github.com/moebooru/moebooru], a heavily-modified fork of the Danbooru 1 software. Sometimes, you may want to upload an image from Yande.re to Danbooru.\r\n\r\nh4. When to upload\r\n\r\nIf the image was posted to Yande.re from another site, such as the artist's Pixiv or homepage, and that page is still available, upload from that site instead. Only upload from Yande.re if it is a [[scan]]. On Yande.re, pictures that aren't scans should have a Source field, while scans do not, but you can double-check by using a \"reverse image search\":[/wiki_pages/67137#dtext-reverse-image].\r\n\r\nh4.

Fullsize image\r\n\r\nPasting the yande.re link (example: https://yande.re/post/show/1073271) into danbooru's upload box will lead to danbooru automatically fetching the highest quality version from yande.re. Alternatively, you can use the \"bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet] on the yande.re post page. \r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Yande.re contains posts greater than 100MB in filesize (example: https://yande.re/post/show/1086192).

How to find an artist's name\r\n\r\nOn most art sites, the artist's name should be prominently displayed somewhere on their profile or alongside the post the art comes from. For smaller sites like an artist's home page or blog, information usually come in \"about\", \"profile\", \"info\", \"link\", \"プロファイル\", \"インフォ\", \"アバウト\", or \"管理人\" page. The artist's name may appear after \"PN\", \"HN\", \"管理人\", \"名前\", etc. Their circle or site name may appear after \"サイト名\" or \"HP\".\r\n\r\nMany Japanese artists will give their name in kanji, which may make it difficult to romanize. Sites like \"Tangorin\":[http://tangorin.com/names/] can offer assistance with this. If there are multiple readings given, try to see if there is a connection between one of them and the artist's pixiv or Twitter username, site name or link, or email address. If you can't figure it out, you can ask in topic #8199 and someone will be able to offer you help.\r\n\r\nIf the artist's name is in kana, you can romanize their name yourself using the tables on Wikipedia for \"hiragana\":[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana] or \"katakana\":[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana]. [[howto:romanize]] contains Danbooru's guidelines on romanization.\r\n\r\nIf the tag name you want to use already exists, you must qualify it with the artist's group name or handle from a site.\r\n\r\nh2. How to make an artist entry\r\n\r\nIdeally this should be done before you tag and post the art, as creating an artist entry will automatically create an associated artist tag and allows automatically fetching the artist from a source post. To create an entry, click the \"create new artist\" link on the upload page, or go to the \"new artist page\":[/artists/new]. Using the link from the upload page will automatically populate the artist entry with an artist name, other names, and URLs, if the site is supported by Danbooru. The automatically populated artist name may not be ideal, so you are free to change it to a better name as determined by the previous section.\r\n\r\nIf you've created a general (blue) tag by mistake, you have to change it to an artist tag before Danbooru will allow you to make an artist entry with that name. To do that, you can simple prefix the tag name with [code]art:[/code] or [code]artist:[/code], or by finding it on the \"tags listing\":[/tags] and clicking \"Edit\". Note that you should not do this for existing tags, only ones you have created as the wrong category by mistake. \r\n\r\nh4. Other Names\r\n\r\nThese are generally what you should add in this field:\r\n\r\n* Names in kanji\r\n* Names in kana\r\n* Site name\r\n* Circle name\r\n* pixiv nickname (find under pixiv avatar)\r\n* pixiv username (find in the pixiv stacc feed URL)\r\n* Twitter name\r\n* Usernames or handles from any other site\r\n\r\nh4. Group\r\n\r\nThis is usually the circle name. Only one group name is supported, as commas and spaces are considered part of the name. Unlike tag names, the group name supports any characters and thus you should use the original spelling and stylization of the name, including CJK characters, asterisks, and capitalization.\r\n\r\nh4. URLs \r\n\r\nAll links that are useful in finding arts and information about the artist.\r\n\r\n* Home Page\r\n* Circle Home Page\r\n* Blog\r\n* pixiv account, including stacc URL if you can find it\r\n* Twitter account, including intent URL if you can find it\r\n* NicoVideo account, with both of the NicoSeiga user/illust/### and user/illust/###?target=illust_all links included\r\n* All other social accounts you can find (DeviantArt, Lofter, Weibo, etc.)\r\n\r\n[b]Do not remove dead URLs.[/b] See topic #8048 for the many reasons why you should leave them alone. Instead, add a - in front of the URL to mark it as dead.\r\n\r\nh4.

What is Danbooru's Moderation Queue?\r\n\r\nDanbooru's Moderation Queue (usually referred to as \"modqueue\") is a system in place to filter out images which do not meet [[help:upload|Danbooru's Quality Standards]].\r\n\r\n[[help:users|Approvers]] are responsible for approving posts in the queue ([[help:users]]). You can view a list of them \"here\":/users?commit=Search&search%5Blevel%5D=>=37.\r\n\r\nh4. How does the modqueue work?\r\n\r\nh6. In Short:\r\n1. A new post is uploaded by an user who is below [[help:users|contributor level]].\r\n2. The post is placed in the modqueue.\r\n3. Approvers review the post.\r\n4. If there are no approvals within 3 days, the post is deleted.\r\n5. If any approver approves the post, the approved post is now active and remains on Danbooru indefinitely.\r\n6. If the post is flagged by another user, go to Step 2.\r\n\r\nPosts which are in the Queue are distinguished by their blue border when browsing thumbnails. \r\n\r\nThe full Queue may be listed by using the search metatag [b]{{status:pending}}[/b]. Approvers may use [b]{{status:unmoderated}}[/b] outside of the modqueue interface to see the pending posts they haven't made a decision on.\r\n\r\nh6. Exceptions and Exemptions:\r\n\r\n\"All contributors and above\":/help/users can post directly to active status, bypassing the modqueue. This privilege is given to frequent uploaders with a track record of uploading consistently high-quality art, to allow them to contribute to the collection without the constraints of the modqueue.\r\n\r\nh4. Help Us Keep Our Gallery Clean!\r\n\r\nIf you find a particularly low quality post that doesn't belong on Danbooru, you may [[howto:flag|flag]] the post to have it return to the modqueue for a second check.\r\n\r\nSimply open the post in full view, and click on [b]Flag[/b] on the left pane, third choice from the top under [b]Options[/b]. You will be prompted to enter your reason for returning the post to the Queue. Click on OK, and the image's approval will be reconsidered.\r\n\r\nh4. What should I do about my deleted Posts?\r\n\r\nMost of the time, it is safe to assume that every post in the Queue has been reviewed at least once.\r\n\r\nIf an upload isn't approved after three days, it is mostly because it doesn't meet our quality standards.

The player controls [[Sakai Jin]], a [[samurai]] on a quest to protect Tsushima Island during the \"first Mongol invasion\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Japan#First_invasion_(1274) of [[Japan]]. \r\n\r\nJin must choose between following the warrior code to fight honorably, or using practical but dishonorable methods of repelling the Mongols with minimal casualties. The game features a large open world which can be explored either on foot or on horseback. When facing enemies, the player can choose to engage in a direct confrontation using Jin's [[katana]] or to become a legendary warrior known as \"the Ghost\" by using stealth tactics to assassinate opponents. \r\n\r\nSucker Punch began developing the game  in 2014 with a heavy emphasis on melee combat. The studio collaborated with \"Japan Studio\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Studio and visited Tsushima Island twice to ensure that the game was as culturally and historically authentic as possible. The team was heavily inspired by samurai cinema, particularly films directed by \"Kurosawa Akira\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa , as well as the comic book series [[Usagi Yojimbo]]. The game's landscape and minimalistic art style were influenced by [[Shadow of the Colossus]], and locations in the game were designed to be \"the perfect photographer's dream\". While the in-game landmass is similar in shape to \"Tsushima Island\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsushima_Island , the team did not intend to create a one-to-one recreation. Ilan Eshkeri and Umebayashi Shigeru composed the game's soundtrack.\r\n\r\nThe game was released for [[PlayStation 4]] in July 2020, and an expanded version for PlayStation 4 and [[PlayStation 5]], subtitled Director's Cut and featuring the \"Iki Island\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iki_Island expansion, was released in August 2021. A multiplayer mode titled Ghost of Tsushima: Legends was released in October 2020 and made available separately in September 2021.\r\n\r\nThe game received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's melee combat, story, characters, performances, and music, though it received some criticism for its implementations of stealth gameplay and open world structure. The game was a commercial success, selling more than 9.73 million copies by July 2022 and was one of Sony's fastest-selling original games. It was nominated for several end-of-the-year awards, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2020 and 24th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.
