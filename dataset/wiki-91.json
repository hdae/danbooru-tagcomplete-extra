It is the first game in the [[Sonic (series)|Sonic franchise]]. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. \r\n\r\nThe game features [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], who can run at supersonic speeds, setting out on a quest to defeat [[Dr. Eggman]] (Robotnik), a scientist who has imprisoned animals inside hostile [[robot]]s and seeks the powerful [[Chaos Emerald]]s. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay involves collecting [[ring (sonic)|]]s as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a new mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by [[Mario (series)|Super Mario]] series creator Miyamoto Shigeru. \r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Naka Yuji. The music was composed by Nakamura Masato, songwriter of the J-pop band [i]Dreams Come True[/i].\r\n\r\nSonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It is widely considered one of the greatest video games of all time. It was also commercially successful, becoming one of the best-selling video games of all time with approximately 24 million copies sold worldwide across all platforms. Furthermore, it established the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo]] Entertainment System console. \r\n\r\nThe game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into [[sonic the hedgehog (film)|other media]]. It was followed by [[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]] in 1992.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182982,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:47:44.141-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:47:44.141-05:00","title":"schneewittchen_(wonderland_wars)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["シュネーヴィッツェン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182981,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:39.112-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:39.112-05:00","title":"bonbonzaka_koukou_engeki-bu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ボンボン坂高校演劇部"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182980,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:27.570-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:40:27.570-05:00","title":"junna_shoutarou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["順菜正太郎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182978,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:29:05.634-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:29:05.634-05:00","title":"yukione","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["雪オネェ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182977,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:25:16.099-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:25:16.099-05:00","title":"chiba_ryohei","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["千葉涼平"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182976,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:05:08.955-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:05:08.955-05:00","title":"isarai_yuuki","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小衣優希"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182975,"created_at":"2024-01-26T11:01:02.756-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T11:01:02.756-05:00","title":"ruru_(venom)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ルル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":182974,"created_at":"2024-01-26T10:58:48.661-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T10:59:41.954-05:00","title":"wonder_woman_(movie)","body":"Wonder Woman is a 2017 superhero film based on the [[DC Comics]] [[wonder woman|character of the same name]].

A backronym for \"Field-on Enemy\" in Japanese. Known instead as \"Formido Oppugnatura Exsequens\" in English, replacing the Engrish with faux Latin.\r\n\r\nUnlike regular enemies, they appear in the field and have specific behaviors, like patrolling set patterns or chasing after the player. When first encountered, they are likely to easily wipe out the party; many of the puzzles in the Labyrinth revolve around avoiding encounters with them. If killed, they respawn after 3 in-game days.\r\n\r\nIn battle, different types of F.O.E have different appearances just like any other enemy, but in the DS era they all appear as a fuzzy orange ball in the field. This led to an association with [[Kedama (touhou)|]] from Touhou.  This also produced the alternate backronym \"Fuzzy Orange Enemy\".\r\n\r\nMade famous by Iosys's F.O.E. song, \"えふおーいーとのそうぐう (F.O.E. to no Souguu)\".\r\n\r\nh4.

Initially a state-funded product, it was later produced by Zastava Arms and introduced in 1961. It saw use in a number of conflicts following the breakup of former Yugoslavia. The M56's external design is based on the captured [[MP40]], both [[weapon]]s featuring an [[folding stock|underfolding stock]], but easily distinguished from the MP40 by its increased length, charging handle on the right side, curved [[magazine (weapon)|magazine]] (32-round is its standard capacity), and [[bayonet]] attachment support.
