It follows two girls - one who's a black-haired [[oni_(hentatsu)|oni]] (voiced by Takasugi Kaoru) and another who's pink-haired, wears glasses and has [[neko_(hentatsu)|cat ears]] (voiced by [[Kadowaki Mai]]) - as they discuss a variety of things.\r\n\r\nFollowing a teaser on the 28th of December (announcing that something was to be aired on four different channels on the 4th of January, 2020 at 23:57), it was revealed on the 4th that Hentatsu would be airing a new set of shorts on TV, the shorts being shortly after being uploaded to Twitter and YouTube. \r\n\r\nDuring the original web shorts, the two girls remained unnamed, though Kadowaki referred to her character as 猫さん (neko-san/cat). With the TV shorts, the official website made for them merely refers to them as \"Oni\" and \"Neko\" respectively.\r\n\r\nFans theorize that the oni girl represents [[tatsuki_(irodori)|irodori]]'s [[tatsuki_(person)|Tatsuki]], while the cat-eared girl represents [[Isa Yoshihisa]], another member of irodori. Isa is credited in irodori's works as 平安, which is usually pronounced Heian, but is pronounced Hen in Okinawa; Isa being an Okinawan family name. This would make the title of the series a combination of Hen and Tatsuki's names.\r\n\r\nh4.

Kea are known for their intelligence and curiosity, vital to their survival in a harsh mountain environment. Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing and pulling things in a certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain objective. They have been filmed preparing and using tools.\r\n\r\nNow uncommon, the kea was once killed for bounty due to concerns by the sheep-farming community that it attacked livestock, especially sheep.

The bill is long, thin and hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes. Some Southern Hemisphere species are black and white, and a few are quite colorful. Many species have areas of bare skin on the face which can be bright blue, orange, red, yellow or a combination of these. \r\n\r\nAll species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface. They are excellent divers, and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings. Some species have been measured to dive 150'.\r\n\r\nAfter diving, they often take a perch and spread their wings to dry out. This pose is frequently depicted in art.\r\n\r\nThe Pokémon [[Cramorant]] almost certainly takes its name and design from a cormorant.\r\n\r\nh4. Cormorants in Fishing Culture & Japan\r\n\r\nHumans have used cormorants' fishing skills in various places in the world. Archaeological evidence suggests that cormorant fishing was practiced in Ancient Egypt, Peru, Korea and India, but the strongest tradition has remained in China and Japan. \r\n\r\nIn Japan, cormorant fishing is called ukai (鵜飼). Traditional forms of ukai can be seen on the Nagara River in the city of Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, where cormorant fishing has continued uninterrupted for 1300 years, or in the city of Inuyama, Aichi. In Gifu, the Japanese cormorant is used, while Chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants. In Europe, a similar practice was used in the region of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nIn a common technique, a snare is tied near the base of the bird's throat, which allows the bird only to swallow small fish. When the bird captures and tries to swallow a large fish, the fish is caught in the bird's throat. When the bird returns to the fisherman's raft, the fisherman helps the bird to remove the fish from its throat. The method is not as common today, since more efficient methods of catching fish have been developed, but it continues to exist as a cultural tradition.\r\n\r\nh4.
