History\r\nIn real life, [i]West Virginia[/i] was among the battleships sunk in Pearl Harbor, moored outboard of [[Tennessee (Azur Lane)|]] and thus took the brunt of the damage. Refloated in May 1942, she was modernized in the West Coast in a style similar to the Tennessee-class: turning their superstructures into a compact form reminiscent of [[South Dakota (Azur Lane)|]]. Unlike the two Tennessee-class ships, the scale of her damage and modernization meant she only reentered active service in mid-1944, in time for the battle of Leyte Gulf. Here, she led the battle line that engaged \"Nishimura's fleet\":/pools/9549 in the last battleship-to-battleship engagement in history, firing the opening shots against [[Yamashiro (Azur Lane)|]] from 20.8 km out and Mogami from Artillery bombardment, knocking the Heavy Cruiser out of action.\r\n\r\nLater seeing service in Iwo Jima and Okinawa, she was decommissioned in 1947 and scrapped 12 years later.\r\n\r\nh4.

However, after the end of [[choujikuu yousai macross|Space War I]] the ship was redesigned as the first of a series of massive colonization craft developed for the program of expansion of human civilization and culture across the [[galaxy]].\r\n\r\nThe SDF-2 can't transform and was designed with various minimal armaments to ensure more space was available for colonists and bigger life support systems. However, a large complement of [[mecha]], which included several [[destroid]]s and the brand new [[VF-4]] variable fighters, were onboard the new vessel. Also, a defense [[fleet]] composed of many Earth and [[Zentradi]] warships provided escort for the Megaroad. The Megaroad class ships were eventually succeded by the bigger and more advanced [[city 7|City Class Starships]]. \r\n\r\nThe SDF-2 Megaroad-01 was designed by [[Miyatake Kazutaka]] in the 1980s.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SDF-2","Megaroad-01"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":41050,"created_at":"2012-12-17T13:09:03.079-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-10T19:43:55.090-05:00","title":"uraga_class_carrier","body":"A fictional [[military]] [[spacecraft]] from the [[MACROSS]] science fiction anime series.\r\n\r\nThe [b]Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier[/b] is the next generation stealth carrier built to replace the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers in the Earth's military forces. \r\n\r\nThe Uraga Class, built with weaponry, armor and maneuverability comparable to a cruiser, is often used as the flagship of small [[U.N. Spacy]] and [[N.U.N.S.]] fleets. \r\n\r\nAt 550 meters long, the Uraga Class ships are much larger conventional spacecraft but still significantly smaller than the [[SDF-1|SDF-1 Macross]] or the later New Macross Class ships. The Uraga is built with a stealth composition superstructure and features a dual deck launching system for [[variable fighter]]s; one deck running the latter dorsal two-thirds of the ship and an internal deck underneath with a launching deck in the forward third. This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.\r\n\r\nThese ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the [[ARMD]] carriers but the U.N.G. remains committed to replacing the older ARMD carriers one by one with Uraga Class ships. As more Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are built, they are poised to become the mainstay combat and carrier ship for the U.N. Spacy. Many Uraga Class vessels are part of the Earth's defense fleet and are found serving as command ships for large groups of [[Guantanamo Class Stealth Carrier]]s and [[Northampton Class Stealth Frigate]]s. Several Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are also in active service as defensive stations docked to unarmed core ships.\r\n\r\nIn real life this ship was designed by artist [[Miyatake Kazutaka]] in the 90s.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":225727,"created_at":"2025-02-10T19:43:42.539-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-10T19:43:42.539-05:00","title":"shin'you_(oktoberfest)_(kancolle)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["神鷹(オクトーバーフェスト)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":15237,"created_at":"2009-11-19T18:28:12.590-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-10T19:40:28.620-05:00","title":"macross_scrambled_valkyrie","body":"[b]Chō Jikū Yōsai Macross: Scrambled Valkyrie[/b] is a 16-megabit, 2D shooter released on the [[Nintendo]] [[Super Famicom]] in 1993 and based on the 1984 animated movie The Super Dimension Fortress [[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]] \r\n\r\nThe story takes place after the movie's ending but before the launch of the [[SDF-2 Megaroad-01]]. \r\n\r\nThe game was developed by WinkySoft and published by Zamuse.

He and his wife, Thea von Harbou, wrote the silent film, which starred Gustav Fröhlich, Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. \r\n\r\nIt is regarded as a pioneering work of the serious science fiction genre in movies, being among the first feature length movies of the genre ever made. It also has been considered a semi-[[cyberpunk]] film created many decades before the genre even began. \r\n\r\nMetropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's ruler, and Maria, a poor worker, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city. \r\n\r\nThe movie was made in [[Germany]] during the \"Weimar Period\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic]. Filming took place in 1925 at a cost of approximately five million Reichsmarks. The art direction draws influence from Bauhaus, Cubist and Futurist design.\r\n\r\nMetropolis was met with a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it pictorially beautiful and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of naiveté.\r\n\r\nNumerous attempts have been made to restore the film since the 1970s. Music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists such as [[Freddie Mercury]], Loverboy and Adam Ant in 1984. A new reconstruction of Metropolis was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 2001, and the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in the same year, the first film thus distinguished. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process, the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\r\n\r\nh4.

In contrast with rats and mice, he's very fond of [[dorayaki]]. He will occasionally get mad if he does not eat dorayaki for 2 or 3 days. He will do anything for dorayaki. Because of this, Nobita often bribes Doraemon with dorayaki in exchange for borrowing some gadget. \r\n\r\nBecause of his popularity in and out of [[Japan]] he was officially named by the Japanese government as a [b]Cultural ambassador of modern Japan[/b].

The habit is typically white-on-black, with black the predominant color, but they can also be wholly white, or white-on-blue. Color can depend on the religious order which the nun is a part of (ex. Carmelites being white-on-brown). They can also be wholly black, which is the common choice for Orthodox nuns.\r\n\r\nThe traditional habit can be accentuated with minor additions, but not so much that it detracts from the basics (ex. [[Sister Claire]] and [[Double (skullgirls)|]] as opposed to [[Specter (arknights)|]] and [[Index (toaru majutsu no index)|]]), and some degree of modesty must be adhered to (ex. not too tight-fitting, no shortened dresses, no cutouts, no openings where they wouldn't normally be ala the chest area, no side slits which reveal skin or undergarment, no overtly sexual depictions of certain undergarments, etc).\r\n\r\nh4.

On the opposite end, you can have \"the sweetest Tashkent around\":[/pools/14819].\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe Tashkent class of ships consisted of a single destroyer leader, built in Italy for the Soviet navy just before World War II. Three other ships were ordered but canceled before construction. The class is named after Tashkent, \"the capital city\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent] of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (now Uzbekistan).\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nThe real life destroyer Tashkent had a top speed of 43 knots, technically making her faster than [[Shimakaze (destroyer)|]] but slower than the French destroyer [[Le Terrible (destroyer)|Le Terrible]]. With that in mind, she is currently the fastest destroyer implemented in game.\r\n\r\nh4.

Independent of the Mega Drive, the 32X utilizes its own ROM cartridges and had its own library of games. \r\n\r\nUnveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the 32X as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games...\". The product was originally conceived as an entirely new console by [[Sega]] of Japan and positioned as an inexpensive alternative for gamers into the fifth generation of game consoles, but at the suggestion of Sega of America, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Mega Drive and made more powerful, with two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. \r\n\r\nDespite these changes, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the following year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a weak library of titles. With sales only reaching as high as 665,000 units, the 32X is still considered a commercial failure.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スーパー32X"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":225241,"created_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:48.166-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:48.166-05:00","title":"ganesha_(danmachi)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガネーシャ(ダンまち)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":225240,"created_at":"2025-02-08T01:48:38.633-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:48:38.633-05:00","title":"artemis_(danmachi)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アルテミス(ダンまち)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":189158,"created_at":"2024-04-07T08:08:06.092-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:48:33.365-05:00","title":"ooi!_tonbo","body":"Tonbo!

OCG Structures is a manga series. It is set in a real-world Tokyo, Japan. The manga began serialization on June 21, 2019, in the V Jump magazine. The manga is authored by [[sato masashi|Masashi Satō]], who previously did the artwork for the [[yu-gi-oh!_5d's|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]] manga.\r\nUnlike previous manga spin-offs, OCG Structures manga does not have an anime counterpart; however, characters from the Japan-only Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Saikyo Card Battle make appearances. \r\n\r\nThe manga is based around the real-world OCG rules, as well as set releases. No new card types are introduced, but due to the nature of the manga, any previous type can be the focus of the chapter, based on the Deck the Duelists have built. \r\n\r\nThe series follows [[yusa_shoma|Shoma Yusa]], who moved to a big city from the deep countryside at the invitation of his older sister.\r\n\r\nh4.
