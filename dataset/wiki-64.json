Famous for its powerful soundtrack, over the top action and violence, intricate mechanical design by Oohata, multiple animation errors and bizarre story, M.D. Geist is generally seen as a bad production, but has also become somewhat of a cult classic.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the war-torn planet of Jerra has been locked in a war between the Earth government loyalists and the Nexrum corporation for decades. To counter Nexrum's advanced weapons, the Earth government developed one-man armies, the Most Dangerous Soldiers. However they proved to be far too strong, and most eventually lost their minds and went on rampage. Being one of the surviving Most Dangerous Soldiers, [[MDS-02 GEIST]] was put into stasis inside a satellite in Jerra's orbit. Years later, the satellite prison crashes on the desolate planet and Geist reawakens. He recovers a Powered Suit, battles with bandits and units of the Nexrum military and eventually joins a group of Earth army commandos in a mission to deactivate the secret doomsday weapon on Jerra: a self-replicating robot swarm known as \"Death Force\". However, there's more than meets the eye to Geist.\r\n\r\nA sequel OVA, \"M.D. Geist II: Death Force\", was made a decade later, alongside a comic book prequel. The 1986 OVA has also received a Director's Cut edition, which fixes the animation errors, adds more blood and some new footage.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["装鬼兵MDガイスト","装鬼兵M.D.ガイスト","MDガイスト"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":76909,"created_at":"2016-06-26T01:32:47.902-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-10T21:05:55.736-04:00","title":"tag_group:locations","body":"[See [[tag groups]].]\r\n\r\n[expand=Table of Contents]\r\n* 1. \"Indoors\":#dtext-indoors\r\n* 2. \"Outdoors\":#dtext-outdoors\r\n** 2.1 \"Natural settings\":#dtext-natural\r\n** 2.2 \"Man-made\":#dtext-manmade\r\n* 3. \"Buildings\":#dtext-buildings\r\n* 4. \"Fictional locations\":#dtext-fictional\r\n** 4.1 \"Ace Combat\":#dtext-ac\r\n** 4.2 \"Dragon Ball\":#dtext-db\r\n** 4.3 \"Hokuto no Ken\":#dtext-hnk\r\n** 4.4 \"Sword Art Online\":#dtext-sao\r\n** 4.5 \"Touhou\":#dtext-touhou\r\n* 5. \"Other\":#dtext-other\r\n* 6. \"See also\":#dtext-also\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nExisting tags identifying the location being depicted\r\n\r\nh4#indoors.

The common sunflower is most recognizable by their single large yellow apical \"flower,\" with an initially greenish center that turns yellow-brown and then blackish as it matures.  They typically grow to heights of around 3 meters (10 feet) with record plants reach heights of 9+ meters (30+ feet). Sunflowers are grown for various purposes such as for food, cooking oil, livestock feed, and decoration. \r\n\r\nDomestic sunflowers come in a variety of colors beyond the common yellow, with colors such as cream color, gold, orange, red, mahogany, and chocolate brown.  While the common types only feature a singular apical flower (one that grows at the tip of the central stem), there are also varieties that grow many additional branching flowers.  The large blooms of the sunflower while commonly called a \"flower\" is in fact a \"flower head,\" a structure composed of many smaller flowers (florets) that together appear as one single flower.\r\n\r\nSunflowers and their relatives are heliotropic while they're developing, meaning that the plants will turn following the direction of the sun during the day.  As they get closer to maturing, the plant stiffen and lose it's ability to track the sun. Due to their heliotropic nature, most plants will mature locked facing toward the East, the direction of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\n* !post #6797029\r\n\r\nh4.

It was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer, and stars James McAvoy, [[Michael Fassbender]], Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence, January Jones, Oliver Platt, and Kevin Bacon.

First Class is set primarily in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and focuses on the relationship between [[Charles Xavier]] and Erik Lehnsherr / [[Magneto]], and the origin of their groups—the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, respectively, as they deal with the Hellfire Club led by Sebastian Shaw, a mutant supremacist bent on enacting nuclear war.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":190661,"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:58:27.172-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-10T01:37:47.599-04:00","title":"x-men_origins:_wolverine","body":"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 2009 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics fictional character [[Wolverine (x-men)|]].

[[Hajimari no Kiseki]] exclusive characters need to be listed. [[Zero no Kiseki|Zero]] and [[Ao no Kiseki|Ao]] could probably be put into one section and I believe there are a handful of missing characters there as well.

The game was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and first published by [[Konami]] in 1998 for the [[PlayStation 1]] video game console. \r\n\r\nIt is the sequel to Kojima's early MSX2 computer games [[Metal Gear (series)|]] and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike [spoilers]using an advanced combat [[mecha]] known as [[Metal Gear REX]][/spoilers].\r\n\r\nMetal Gear Solid was very well received by critics and sold many units. It is recognized by many experts as one of the best and most important video games of all time, and heralded as the game which made the stealth genre popular. \r\n\r\nThe commercial success of the title prompted the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and PC, titled [i]Metal Gear Solid: Integral[/i]; and a remake with enhanced graphics, [i]Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes[/i] was later released for the [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]].

The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never gone out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It is one of the first works of fiction known to depict alien [[mecha]].\r\n\r\nIt has even influenced the work of [[real life]] [[scientist]]s, most notably American rocket scientist [[Robert Hutchings Goddard]].\r\n\r\nh4.

They are known for their five symmetrical, finely overlapping petals and bright colors in shades of pink, red, blue, and purple; the center is often white. The flowers often have a distinctive star shape in the center, which is often emphasized by artists. Depending on the species, the leaves can be heart-shaped or ivy-shaped (three-lobed). Morning glory [[vines]] are often trained to climb [[trellis]]es but will eagerly climb [[fence]]s as well.\r\n\r\nAs morning glories are easy to grow, Japanese elementary schools often have their students grow them as part of their plant cultivation experience. It is typical summer homework for Japanese students to bring home the morning glories (that they have grown to a certain extent at school) and observe and record their growth (note that summer vacation is in the middle of the school year in Japan).\r\n\r\nIts common Japanese name, アサガオ (朝顔 [i]asa-gao[/i]), literally translates to \"morning face\".
