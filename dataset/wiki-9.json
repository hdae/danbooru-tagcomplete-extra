It is very difficult to write a complete sentence without using a verb in the English language. They can be written in three different tenses; past, present and future. On Danbooru, [b]they are written in \"present participle\":http://www.edufind.com/english/grammar/present_participle.php to denote that a character is doing something at that moment in the image.[/b] The action might be a freeze frame for us (unless it's an animated image), but it is occurring for them in the present and should be tagged as such. A lot of verbs are written in the present tense for this reason, many ending with -ing. If you can also call that verb an object, it should be listed in the gerunds category.

A verb written in -ing form can be turned into a subject or noun depending on how the sentence is structured. For instance, let's use the sentence, \"Tagging images on Danbooru helps to narrow down a search\". The gerund here is [i]tagging[/i] because it is being treated as the subject rather than the action; the actual verb here is [i]helps[/i] because it is describing how useful tagging is.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, and mainly for this site, an -ing verb can also refer to an actual object, not just a verb being turned into a subject. Examples including [i]building[/i] (the act of constructing something vs. the actual structure itself), [i]drawing[/i] (the act of doodling on paper vs. the completed picture itself), or [i]wedding[/i] (the act of being wed vs. the ceremony). [b]If you're able to call an -ing word both a verb and a noun, it should fall under this list as a gerund.[/b] Many of these gerunds already have the -ing verb aliased to them, and their wikis often have the phrases, \"As a verb, it is the act of...\" followed by, \"As a noun...\" to clarify the term both as an action and an object.\r\n\r\nh5.List of tagged gerunds\r\n\r\n* [[battle]] (battling)\r\n* [[bleeding]]\r\n* [[blowing]]\r\n* [[bowling]]\r\n* [[boxing]]\r\n* [[mind control]]\r\n* [[breast padding]]\r\n* [[building]]\r\n** [[model building]]\r\n* [[bullfighting]]\r\n* [[burning]]\r\n* [[camping]]\r\n* [[carving]]\r\n* [[cheating (relationship)|]]\r\n* [[clapping]]\r\n* [[cling]] (clinging)\r\n** [[breast clinging]]\r\n* [[crossdressing]]\r\n* [[dating]]\r\n** [[2D dating]]\r\n* [[dissolving]]\r\n* [[drawing (action)]]\r\n** [[drawing (object)]]\r\n** [[child's drawing]]\r\n* [[drowning]]\r\n* [[face stretching]]\r\n* [[fading]]\r\n* [[fencing]]\r\n* [[fishing]]\r\n* [[flashing]]\r\n** [[mooning]]\r\n** [[streaking]]\r\n* [[flexing]]\r\n* [[foreshortening]]\r\n* [[frottage]]\r\n* [[goldfish scooping]]\r\n* [[grilling]]\r\n* [[hiking]]\r\n* [[hitchhiking]]\r\n* [[horseback riding]]\r\n* [[kidnapping]]\r\n* [[kiss]]\r\n* [[knitting]]\r\n* [[marching]]\r\n* [[masturbation]]\r\n* [[misunderstanding]]\r\n* [[mixed-sex bathing]]\r\n* [[mooning]]\r\n* [[painting (action)|]]\r\n** [[drawing on another's face]]\r\n* [[panicking]]\r\n* [[pose]] (posing)\r\n* [[pout]]\r\n* [[racing]]\r\n* [[recording]]\r\n* [[shipping (fandom)|]]\r\n* [[rotting]]\r\n* [[rowing]]\r\n* [[scolding]]\r\n** [[lecturing]]\r\n* [[sewing]]\r\n* [[shoplifting]]\r\n* [[skating]]\r\n** [[figure skating]]\r\n** [[ice skating]]\r\n* [[skiing]]\r\n* [[slapping]]\r\n* [[smother]]\r\n* [[stalking]]\r\n* [[straddling]]\r\n** [[pillow straddling]]\r\n** [[thigh straddling]]\r\n* [[swimming]]\r\n** [[freediving]]\r\n* [[tail wagging]]\r\n* [[theft]] (stealing)\r\n* [[tribadism]]\r\n* [[unbirthing]]\r\n* [[voyeurism]]\r\n* [[wedding]]\r\n* [[welding]]\r\n* [[wrestling]]\r\n** [[arm wrestling]]\r\n* [[writing]]\r\n* [[yawning]]\r\n\r\nh4.Ambiguous\r\n\r\nFor tags that may fall in one category, but further discussion is required to define which one.\r\n\r\n* [[bullying]]\r\n* [[egg laying]]\r\n* [[pegging]]\r\n* [[penises touching]]\r\n* [[pipelining]]\r\n* [[sounding]]\r\n* [[symmetrical docking]]\r\n** [[asymmetrical docking]]\r\n* [[prostate milking]]\r\n* [[squatting]]\r\n* [[taunting]]\r\n* [[teasing]]\r\n\r\nh4.More references\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia article for Verbs\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb\r\n* \"Wikipedia article for Gerunds\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund\r\n* \"Oxford Dictionaries Online: Adding -ed and -ing\":http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/verb-tenses-adding-ed-and-ing","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":23351,"created_at":"2010-11-04T23:49:59.996-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-11T04:30:12.608-04:00","title":"breast_sucking","body":"When a character is sucking on their own or someone else's [[breasts]].\r\n\r\nUse [[breastfeeding]] if the character is suckling milk from a [[lactation|lactating]] breast.\r\n\r\nh4.

Ryu has made an appearance in every Street Fighter game, as well as in every crossover game with Capcom characters in it. Ryu has become a very famous character in the fighting genre, and is the star of the original Street Fighter.\r\n\r\nAs a very young child, Ryu was orphaned and left with no memories about his parents, and whether they were still alive. He was found and adopted by a man named [[Gouken]] who raised Ryu in his secluded dojo and trained Ryu in the ways of his martial arts. Shortly afterwards, Gouken would later train his best friend's spoiled son, [[Ken Masters]]. Ken served not only as a sparring partner, but also gave Ryu a friend in the form of a boy his own age.\r\n\r\nRyu looked up to Gouken as a father figure, and regards Ken as his best friend and surrogate brother, a relationship which remains to this day. When Ryu was 23 years old, Gouken believed that Ryu was ready to travel the world in order to test and hone his martial skills against the best fighters from around the world. With this, Ryu left Gouken's dojo, and headed to fight in the World Warrior tournament.\r\n\r\nh4.

Originated from a fanart by [[Oshiruko (oshiruco 212048)|]] posted on the end of October 2021, which was later used by Marine herself for the use in her \"sin confessions\" stream. A [[revealing clothes|skimpy]] version of the costume also briefly appeared in her first confession stream.\r\n\r\nThe costume consists of a dark blue [[nun]] habit with white double triangular [[breast curtain]]s and a dark blue [[pelvic curtain]]. There are two \"skimpy\" versions of the outfit, one with the inner garments removed (including [[no bra|bra]] and [[no panties|panties]]) revealing the wearer's [[underboob]] and only has the aforementioned curtains to cover their private parts. The other \"skimpy\" version swaps the long pelvic curtain for an even shorter one covering the crotch, leaving the [[midriff]] exposed. On December 2022, a revised version of the original costume was revealed. This version of the costume differs by using the same hairstyle of her [[houshou marine (marching band)|band costume]] and the addition of a suggestive [[underboob cutout]] on the costume.\r\n \r\nWhile this costume is technically unofficial (as it never received an official model for obvious reasons), it has gained notoriety within and out of the Hololive fanbase for its frequent usage by Marine herself, which resulted in it gaining the status of a [[meme attire]].\r\n\r\nThis tag is applicable to any posts that:\r\n* Features Marine herself wearing any variant of the outfit or derivative of it, and not a generic [[nun]] outfit.\r\n* Has other character(s) wearing any variant of the outfit or derivative of it.

It was a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the Mediterranean, with its capital in Constantinople (modern-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). While its citizens identified themselves Romans, it is distinct from the earlier Roman Empire due to factors like the shift of the capital, the integration of Christianity, and the use of Greek instead of Latin.\r\n\r\nOver its history, the Byzantine Empire went through periods of expansion and decline. It reached its peak under Emperor \"Justinian I\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I, reconquering previous western Mediterranean territories. It faced challenges from conflicts, including the \"Byzantine-Sasanian Wars\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Persian_Wars#Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_wars and \"Muslim conquests\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Muslim_conquests, which led to the loss of key provinces. The \"Macedonian dynasty\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_dynasty oversaw a revival, but it eventually declined due to \"civil wars\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Byzantine_revolts_and_civil_wars and the \"Fourth Crusade\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade, which divided its territories.\r\n\r\nMaking a brief recovery in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained a regional power until its fall in 1453. The \"Fall of Constantinople\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople marked the end of the empire and the start of the early modern period. Refugees from Constantinople played a role in the [[Renaissance]], and the fall of the \"Empire of Trebizond\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond followed shortly after.\r\n\r\nIts existence has a lasting legacy, particularly in the fields of art, architecture, law, and Christianity, which continue to influence the world to this day. It should be noted that the name \"Byzantine\" is actually modern term used by Historians to differentiate it from the Western Roman Empire that fell as the Byzantines at the time still called themselves as \"Romans\".\r\n\r\nh4.

It is piloted by [[Banagher Links]].\r\n\r\nThe Full Armor Mode was an enhancement plan devised by [[Irei Takuya]] while aboard the Nahel Argama and is based on Takuya's extensive knowledge of mobile suits. After Banagher's Newtype potential manifests itself, the [[Psycho Frame]] changes color to a vibrant green. Unlike other mobile suits with the Full Armor designation, the FA Unicorn does not consist of any additional armor for the MS frame itself (except extra [[shield|shields]]). However it does introduce a large array of weapons, which are added to the legs, backpack and forearms.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, what appears to be a haphazard collection of weaponry is actually a superbly balanced set-up which draws out the maximum combat potential of the Unicorn. The new array of weapons includes two backpack-mounted hyper bazookas, numerous hand grenades and grenade launchers, missile pods, forearm-mounted Gatling guns, and two additional I-field-equipped shields, one on the backpack and the other on the right forearm. The backpack also features two massive vernier-boosters taken from a [[base_jabber|Base Jabber Type 94]] to compensate for the increased mass, with one of the additional shields situated between them. The unit's entire weapons load can be disconnected at any time if the ammunitions are completely spent to avoid becoming dead-weight. Like the normal Unicorn, the Full Armor Unicorn can take control of an enemy's psycommu weapons, even Quasi-Psycommu bits, when the [[NT-D]] is activated.\r\n\r\nJust like the original Unicorn, its Full Armor version is designed in real life by [[Katoki Hajime]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フルアーマーユニコーンガンダム"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236398,"created_at":"2025-04-09T01:22:15.478-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T01:22:15.478-04:00","title":"touma_saya_(cosplay)","body":"[[Cosplay]] of [[SPEC]]'s [[Touma Saya]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236397,"created_at":"2025-04-09T01:14:12.641-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T01:14:12.641-04:00","title":"yoshino_prevail_(umamusume)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヨシノプリヴェール"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236396,"created_at":"2025-04-09T01:13:01.068-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T01:13:01.068-04:00","title":"akeishi_gorou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["明石梧郎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236395,"created_at":"2025-04-09T00:53:50.308-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:53:50.308-04:00","title":"zanhuawei","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["簪花围"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236394,"created_at":"2025-04-09T00:34:38.754-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:34:38.754-04:00","title":"my_in-laws_are_obsessed_with_me","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["시월드가_내게_집착한다","시월드가내게집착한다","老公对我太执着"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236393,"created_at":"2025-04-09T00:32:44.838-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:33:35.930-04:00","title":"the_first_night_with_the_duke","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["남주의_첫날밤을_가져버렸다","남주의첫날밤을가져버렸다","我夺走了公爵的第一次"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145414,"created_at":"2022-06-15T16:55:56.072-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:33:13.125-04:00","title":"under_the_oak_tree","body":"[b]Under the Oak Tree[/b] is a Korean webnovel and manhwa.\r\n\r\nh4.
