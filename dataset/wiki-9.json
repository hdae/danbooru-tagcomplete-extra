Noh masks are also used in Kyōgen performances (the comedic counterpart to [i]Noh[/i]) and sometimes also in other Japanese performing arts and ceremonies.\r\n\r\nNoh masks are traditionally made from carved cypress wood, painted or lacquered. They are frequently affixed by means of a red silk tying cord. They tend to employ heavy emphasis of shadows in order to portray different emotions (which can be changed by angling the mask).\r\n\r\nMasks depicting human beings tend to reflect traditional medieval Japanese aesthetics (resembling characters from woodcut prints), having pale 'chubby' faces with well defined brows and cheek lines, plus prominent eyebrows. Masks depicting older humans tend to have extensive wrinkles and beards.\r\n\r\nMasks depicting supernatural entities tend to have large eyes and exaggerated expressions. They may also have horns, fangs and other nonhuman features. Gold paint is frequently used to (literally) highlight the otherworldly appearance of such entities.\r\n\r\nNoh masks are used to portray different characters when on stage, similar to Western makeup. An actor may, however, rapidly switch between different masks to fulfill different roles.\r\n\r\nh4.

References to the pea jacket appear in American [[newspaper]]s at least as early as the 1720s, and modern renditions still maintain the original design and composition.\r\n\r\nIt was originally worn (navy blue colour) by sailors of European and later American navies.

She is best known, however, for being quite moralistic and calling out other characters on their faults - more so (sometimes with physical punishment) upon her errant shinigami, [[Onozuka Komachi]]. Based on her illustration from \"The Grimoire of Marisa\", fanworks often comically depict her as rather petite and [[flat chest|flat-chested]] compared to her imposing, busty employee - something which angers Eiki - though a full-figured woman with long legs and [[zettai ryouiki]] is another depiction often used in fanart. Canon is inconsistent on which form is true, with some speculation that the child depiction is used as an alternate form for reasons unknown.\r\n\r\nYamaxanadu (ヤマザナドゥ) is her title (meaning \"Yama of Paradise\"), but has led fans to erroneously read her name as \"Shikieiki Yamaxanadu\". In actuality, her given name is Eiki and her surname is Shiki.\r\n\r\nShe has [[short hair|short]] [[green hair]] often cut [[asymmetrical hair|asymmetrically]] and either [[blue eyes|blue]] or [[green eyes]]. Her outfit is a [[frilled hat|frilled]] [[blue hat]], a [[blue vest]] with [[buttons]] and a [[ribbon-trimmed vest|ribbon trim]] and [[epaulettes]], a [[white shirt]] with [[red bow|red]] and [[white bow]]s [[sleeve bow|on]] its [[long sleeves|sleeves]], a [[black skirt]] also with a [[ribbon-trimmed skirt|ribbon trim]], [[white socks]], and [[black shoes|black]] [[mary janes]].
