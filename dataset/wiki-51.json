The series is well known for its \"Arino's Challenge\" (有野の挑戦状, [i]Arino no Chousenjou[/i]) segments, where Arino plays through and attempts to complete retro games with the help of his Assistant Directors and various other staff members. It was briefly brought over to the West in the late 2000's as [i]Retro Game Master[/i]. [[Nintendo]] eventually released a parody of the series in 2015 on its Youtube page titled [i]Gamecenter DX[/i], which has Arino's co-star Hamaguchi Masaru as a manager playing games that haven't been released.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the series had a [[Nintendo DS]] game modeled after it: [i][[Gamecenter CX: Arino's Challenge]][/i], with a lot of the game's input coming directly from the show's staff. The game then got a sequel in 2009 and a [[Nintendo 3DS]] sequel in 2014.\r\n\r\nh4.

The 19th century saw the height of its power under [[Alexander I]] and [[Nicholas I]], but internal unrest, serfdom, and defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905) weakened it.

The game is known for its peculiar sense of humor. It was created by a single author, but was abandoned unfinished. It has since been taken up as an open-source project by multiple modders as \"Elona+\" and received expansions, but the original plot is likely never to be finished as it was intended.\r\n\r\n\"Elona\" is a portmanteau of \"Eternal League Of NefiA\", a mysterious (to the point of being only mentioned once in the unfinished plot) organization apparently behind fate. \r\n\r\nElona takes place on a world called Irva, where the world is tormented by the blowing of the etherwinds, which cause mutations that kill humanoids and make monsters more powerful and ferocious. Because the etherwinds come from the Vindale Forest, home of the [[elf]]-like Elea, the world stands ready to bring war to Vindale.\r\n\r\nElona blends standard RPG tropes with a Lovecraftian theme (including a Sanity meter). It also features guns, cyborgs, steampunk, references to the likes of [[Aliens (1986)|]] and [[Bioshock (series)|]] and many other dissimilar tropes to create an oddball fantasy/sci-fi kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nYou can read a translation of the plot here: [s]http://elona.squares.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5025[/s]\r\n\r\nh4.

Established in June 1917 under [[Lavr Kornilov]], commander of the Russian Eighth Army, it began as the 1st Shock Detachment to counter the crumbling discipline of the post-February Revolution army. Initiated by [[Aleksei Brusilov]]’s call for \"revolutionary shock battalions,\" the unit was renamed in Kornilov’s honor in August 1917 and became known for its fierce loyalty and combat prowess.\r\n\r\nLed initially by Captain [[Mitrofan Nezhentsev]], the regiment grew from a volunteer force of officers and soldiers into a symbol of anti-Bolshevik resistance. After the [[October Revolution]], it joined Lavr Kornilov in southern Russia, becoming one of the first units of the Volunteer Army alongside generals like [[Mikhail Alekseyev]] and [[Anton Denikin]]. The regiment fought in major campaigns, including the [[Ice March of 1918]], where Kornilov died in battle. It later expanded into a brigade and division, enduring heavy losses until its evacuation from Crimea in 1920 under [[Pyotr Wrangel]].\r\n\r\nThe Kornilovites were renowned for their distinctive red-and-black uniforms and skull-and-crossbones insignia, reflecting their oath to fight to the death. They clashed repeatedly with the [[soviet_army|Red Army]], led by figures like [[Leon Trotsky]], and remained a disciplined force amid the chaos of civil war.\r\n\r\nh4.

Established under [[Peter the Great]], it grew into one of the largest and most formidable armies in Europe, playing a key role in conflicts like the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]], and [[World War I]].\r\n\r\nUnder Peter the Great, the army modernised with a standing force, moving away from reliance on irregular troops. Later rulers, such as [[Catherine the Great]], expanded its reach and influence. By the 19th century, commanders like [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] led it to victory against [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1812, cementing its reputation. In World War I, under [[Nicholas II]], the army initially mobilised millions but faced heavy losses and logistical failures, contributing to its collapse during the 1917 upheavals.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Russian Army was known for its vast conscripted ranks, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. It ceased to exist after the Bolsheviks, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the monarchy, with many of its remnants joining the [[White Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The Red Army, organized by [[Leon Trotsky]], aimed to establish a socialist state. Opposing them was the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, liberals, and anti-Bolshevik socialists, led by figures like [[Alexander Kolchak]] and [[Anton Denikin]]. Other groups, such as the anarchist Black Army led by [[Nestor Makhno]] and the peasant [[Green_Army|Green Armies]], fought against both major sides.\r\n\r\nForeign powers also played a role, with the Allied nations (Britain, France, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Germany) intervening at various points. Key moments, like the [[Battle of Tsaritsyn]] influenced by [[Joseph Stalin]], shaped the conflict’s course.

The film received a theatrical 3D re-release in 2013, and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Crichton's 1995 sequel novel, The Lost World, was followed by a 1997 film adaptation, also directed by Spielberg. Crichton did not write any further sequels in the series, although Spielberg would return as executive producer for each subsequent film, starting with Jurassic Park III (2001).\r\nh4.Plot\r\nScientists funded by billionaire [[John Hammond]] have discovered how to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off of this technology, Hammond and his company, InGen, decide to build a theme park featuring living [[dinosaur|dinosaurs]]. This in itself would not be such a bad idea — except the organizers are rushing to get it open, have built it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding instead to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.\r\n\r\nNaturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. And Hammond's invited guests to this soft opening — paleontologist [[Alan Grant]], paleobotanist [[Ellie Sattler (Jurassic park)|]], chaotician [[Ian Malcolm]], lawyer Donald Gennaro and Hammond's own grandchildren Tim and Lex Murphy — are caught in the middle of it all.\r\n\r\nH4.
