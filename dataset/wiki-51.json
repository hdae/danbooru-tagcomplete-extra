Released on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]], Z3 marks the first HD release in the SRW series. Like it's [[super robot wars z2|predecessor]], Z3 was released in two parts, the first (Jigoku-hen) in 2014 and the second (Tengoku-hen) in 2015. A third segment (Rengoku-hen) was available for a limited time through redemption codes included in first print copies of Tengoku-hen. This third segment is set between the two main games, and focuses primarily on the original aspects of the story.\r\n\r\nDespite the graphical update, the Z3 games have faced criticism from fans due to many units and series being cut from the previous games, and a heavier focus on the original story elements as opposed to series roster's stories. Almost every series that debuted in the first game was notably absent in this entry.\r\n\r\nh1.

Equinox then went on to win the 2022 [[Arima Kinen]] as well as the 2023 Dubai Sheema Classic in his overseas stint. Afterwards, he won the 2023 [[Takarazuka Kinen]] by a neck, almost losing to Through Seven Seas due to a fumble. He finished his streak by shattering the race record (and the world record on 2000m turf) at the 2023 Autumn Tenno-sho and dominating a very stacked 2023 Japan Cup. He was retired to stud afterwards, citing he would not have been ready in time for the Arima Kinen.\r\n\r\nHe is Kitasan Black's first G1-winning progeny and proved himself to be not only one of the best racehorses of his generation but also becoming the best rated racehorse in the world.
