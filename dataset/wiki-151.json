Apparently she had to travel quite some distance to obtain it.[/i]\"\r\n -Yasha's in-game description.\r\n\r\nA [[Mecha Musume]] from the game [[Cosmic Break]], Nicole Malice is a white-haired young necromancer who, judging by her descriptions, has a somewhat arrogant personality that diminishes as she grows. In-game, the original Malice can be obtained through the shop for 80000 UC or 80 RT while her red-haired variation, whose parts can't be changed, can be obtained through the Super UC Gara and her other variations are only obtainable through the RT Garapon system. \r\n\r\nNicole Malice was [[Misty Hollow]]'s self-proclaimed rival ever since she started her career in the Cosmic Ark, although Misty supposedly never acknowledged Nicole as her equal during that time. While Nicole's descriptions directly mention Misty, none of Misty's descriptions mention her at all, however Knight's description states that Misty was astonished at her growth, while at the same time it doesn't make any antagonizing remarks at her on Nicole's part. This hints both at Malice's maturation and shows Misty's acknowledgement of her as an actual fighter.\r\n\r\nDuring Nicole's early career as a Cosmic Hero, she relied on her first servant, Dead Eye, to deal significant damage to her opponents while absorbing their energy with her Soul Rod, a homing sub-weapon that replenishes the WB charge every hit. It can be assumed that Nicole met Misty during or even before the time when she became a newbie Hero since her first description already mentions Misty. \r\n\r\nAfter some time, Nicole realized she was still weaker than Misty and decided to learn more about necromancy, eventually summoning a better servant, Skull Eyes. Despite that, Misty was getting even stronger, and Nicole still considered herself too weak. This led her to call her sister, [[Persenachia]], to help her just as Misty acquired her VOID form. \r\n\r\nNicole's plan backfired spectacularly, however, as Misty herself acknowledged Persenachia as a worthy rival. Even though Persenachia effectively stole Nicole's goal, she offered all her support to her little sister, helping her summon a new servant, Dead Phalanx. As Misty and Persenachia kept competing, Nicole began training swordsmanship with a weapon she forged herself, Soul Sword, and as soon as Misty made a contract with the lord of the underworld for more power, thus evolving once more into Raven, Malice resumed her career as Knight with an all-new fighting style, Dead Phalanx and a renewed confidence that, unbeknownst to her, finally earned Misty's respect.\r\n\r\nNicole's admiration for her older sister kept growing, what eventually led her into following Persenachia's steps and experimenting the ART-Type by making a contract with an ART servant, Yomi, also called Dead Slayer. Nicole apparently decided to use bladed weapons ever since she became Knight, as Yomi's \"staff\" is specifically a bladed staff, although most of the time she uses it to fire projectiles, sticking to her new ART-Type style.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":3826,"created_at":"2006-08-25T22:56:57.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-07-12T20:21:08.892-04:00","title":"nevada-tan","body":"[b]Nevada-tan[/b] is the name commonly used to describe an 11-year-old Japanese schoolgirl who was charged with murdering her classmate [[Mitarai Satomi]].

According to her, she used to be \"a  bit of a troublemaker\" who never lost a fight, but also didn't know how to avoid them. When she meet Sylvia on a random town, she immediately challenged the knight to a duel, was easily beat and subsequently sworn loyalty to her.\r\n\r\nHer gameplay is built around precise hits, dodging and hit-and-run tactics. Her rapier's combo ends with a lunge towards the enemy's general direction, which can be used both for blowing them away and evading retaliation. Should the player stop her combo before the lunge, Lafiel will immediately do a backstep, which can be followed by a another lunge. The backstep will most likely dodge any physical counter-attack, but may become a liability agaisnt ranged enemies, so the player must carefully choose their opponents in order to use her full potential. Her rapier also has a Guard command which completely deflects attacks while active, useful for approaching an aware ranged enemy.\r\n\r\nAside from her rapier, Lafiel also carries a dagger which can be thrown at opponents, although its effectiveness is debatable, or used in a parry lunge which also inflicts a debuff on the enemy, causing 5% of their HP in damage should their Wonder Bit be activated. Said debuff is caused by any of her attacks when her Wonder Bit is activated.\r\n\r\nLafiel is near useless amidst a crowd of enemies due to the nature of her attacks. However, if mastered, she truly shines agaisnt small numbers of enemies.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":67672,"created_at":"2015-08-14T03:25:15.840-04:00","updated_at":"2021-07-12T20:18:36.380-04:00","title":"ikiyouz","body":"Artist.

Often likened to a banjo, it consists of a snakeskin-covered body, neck and three strings.\r\n\r\nIts close resemblance in both appearance and name to the Chinese sanxian suggests its Chinese origins, the old Ryūkyū Kingdom (pre-Japanese Okinawa) having very close ties with China. In the 16th century, the sanshin reached the Japanese trading port at Sakai in Osaka, Japan. In mainland Japan, it evolved into the larger shamisen.\r\n\r\nIn mainland Japan, many people refer to the sanshin as jabisen (蛇皮線, literally \"snake-skin strings\") or jamisen (蛇三線, \"snake three strings\") because the body of the instrument has a snakeskin covering. Traditionally, it was covered with the skin of the Burmese python, but today, due to CITES regulations, the skin of the python reticulatus is also used, as well as cloth. A bamboo bridge raises the strings off the skin.\r\n\r\nThe Sanshin is played either with the traditional plectrum, made of horn and worn on the finger, the nail of the index finger, or, more recently, a guitar pick. \r\n\r\nDirectly after WW2, with a scarcity of materials, Sanshin were made with flat tin cans and scrap wood, called Kankara Sanshin (かんから 三線）. These are still produced today, either as inexpensive instruments or, more often, souvenirs. \r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[Shamisen]]\r\n\r\nh4.

Her death made Ivis go berserk, sucessfully activating the weapon and killing everyone in the facility. Crimrose was later revived at the Cosmic Ark without any memories of her time alive and met Ivis again, although the latter had developed an obssession for Crimrose because of the traumas she experienced in the research facility and, after learning that Crimrose didn't remember her and seeing her acting friendly towards other people, went berserk once again. Her rampage was stopped by Seraph Crimrose, fortunately before she killed anyone, and she escaped. It is stated in Ivis' in-game description that Crimrose bought her back to her senses, although this is never shown. \r\n\r\nCrimrose is later seen along with Ivis in Ground Area, talking to player about their ACs, and as a normal student in Angel Academy.\r\n\r\nIn the game [[Cosmic Break 2]], another Crimrose from the alternate timeline is one of the starter characters.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クリムローゼ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30054,"created_at":"2011-11-03T09:45:34.087-04:00","updated_at":"2021-07-04T23:51:19.351-04:00","title":".flow","body":"[b].flow[/b] is a [i][[Yume Nikki]][/i] fangame made by a Japanese developer going under the alias \"[i]lol[/i]\". \r\nIt features an exploratory-type gameplay style as a girl named [[Sabitsuki]] explores her mind.

His most significant role is in the \"[i]Shigisan-engi[/i]\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigisan-engi emaki. \r\n\r\nThe [i]Shigisan-engi[/i] is also the basis for [[Touhou|Touhou's]] [i][[Undefined Fantastic Object]][/i]. In it, it is told that he had an older sister, who was worried about him. So she searched for Myouren and after being reunited with him, the two lived together again. This woman is the basis for [[Hijiri Byakuren]], whose brother's later death drove her to despair and made her fear her own mortality.\r\n\r\nHis role in Touhou is minor, only serving as backstory for Byakuren. However, ZUN has said he once considered Myouren for a main role in UFO, albeit as an old man. No official character design exists for him, leaving his appearance up to speculation.
