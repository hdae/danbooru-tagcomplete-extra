Unlike American light machine guns, the ammunition belt is fed from the right side using a non-disintegrating belt link. \r\n\r\nThis modernized version can be distinguished from the original [[pk_machine_gun|PK]] by a shorter flash hider; smooth barrel (the earlier one had the first half of the barrel fluted); and a ribbed top cover.\r\n\r\nThis gun is slated to be replaced by the [[PKP_Pecheneg|PKP Pecheneg]]. The best way to differentiate between the PKM and the PKP is the position of the carry handle; the Pecheneg's carry handle is right above the barrel while the PKM's carry handle protrudes above the receiver.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["PKM"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":9900,"created_at":"2009-01-19T20:36:33.969-05:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T20:27:52.553-04:00","title":"nakahira_guy","body":"Mangaka, illustrator, and doujin artist.\r\nJapanese name: 中平凱\r\nCircle name: Metamorphose","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114564,"created_at":"2020-07-05T20:14:38.423-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T20:14:38.423-04:00","title":"fukase_yoriko","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["深瀬頼子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114562,"created_at":"2020-07-05T20:08:19.287-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T20:08:19.287-04:00","title":"nakitai_watashi_wa_neko_wo_kaburu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["泣きたい私は猫をかぶる","a_whisker_away"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":20778,"created_at":"2010-07-03T21:59:23.346-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T17:48:52.105-04:00","title":"amezawa_koma","body":"Female artist, eromangaka.\r\n\r\nName: 飴沢狛 (Amezawa Koma)\r\nCircle name: ぽんずアメ (Ponzu Ame)\r\nOld circle name: 恋もまた唄う。 (Koi mo Mata Utau.)","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114557,"created_at":"2020-07-05T13:09:34.521-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:09:34.521-04:00","title":"shimada_kai_(sangatsu_no_lion)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["島田開"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114532,"created_at":"2020-07-03T12:22:50.404-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T10:38:12.826-04:00","title":"silver_(metal)","body":"Things made out of silver, such as [[coin|coins]], [[jewelry]] or [[cutlery]].\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[gold]]\r\n* [[silver hair]] - for silver-colored hair","is_locked":false,"other_names":["銀","シルバー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114556,"created_at":"2020-07-05T03:45:27.544-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T03:45:27.544-04:00","title":"yukimi_(yagi)","body":"A character created by [[yagi_(ningen)|yagi]].
