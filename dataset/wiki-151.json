He spoke in an eloquent manner and had refined tastes for one of his species. However, as the story progresses, Meruem starts to grudgingly respect [[komugi_(hunter_x_hunter)|Komugi]], a human girl.

He battles with his identity as a half-human and half-insect, questioning the nature of violence and strength as true power.

Sibir', IPA: [sʲɪˈbʲirʲ] (listen)) is an extensive geographical region, constituting all of North Asia, from the Ural Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east. It has been a part of Russia since the latter half of the 16th century, after the Russians conquered lands east of the Ural Mountains. Siberia is vast and sparsely populated, covering an area of over 13.1 million square kilometres (5,100,000 sq mi), but home to merely one-fifth of Russia's population. Novosibirsk and Omsk are the largest cities in the region.\r\n\r\nBecause Siberia is a geographic and historic region and not a political entity, there is no single precise definition of its territorial borders. Traditionally, Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, and includes most of the drainage basin of the Arctic Ocean. The river Yenisey divides Siberia into two parts, Western and Eastern. Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and to the northern parts of Mongolia and China. The central part of Siberia (West and East Siberian economic regions) was considered the core part of the region in the Soviet Union. Beyond the core, Siberia's western part includes some territories of the Ural region, and the far eastern part has been historically called the Russian Far East.\r\n\r\nSiberia is known worldwide primarily for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of −25 °C (−13 °F). It is geographically situated in Asia; however, due to it being colonized and incorporated into Russia, it is culturally and politically a part of Europe. European cultural influences, specifically Russian, predominate throughout the region, due to it having had Russian emigration from Europe since the 16th century, forming the Siberian Russian sub-ethnic group.[Over 85% of the region's population is of European descent.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["シベリア","西比利亜","西伯利亜","シベリヤ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":150728,"created_at":"2022-09-20T18:37:05.975-04:00","updated_at":"2022-09-20T18:37:05.975-04:00","title":"boku_no_dokuhime_wa_kyou_mo_kawaii","body":"A 4-koma manga drawn by [[sakutake_(ue3sayu)]].

They're like tags or pools, except they belong to you. You can use them to organize your favorite posts, save [[comic]]s you plan to read or translate, to create your own private tags, or just to collect posts as you see fit.\r\n\r\nFavorite groups are similar to [[help:pools|pools]] in that they are an ordered collection of posts that can be browsed through. The main difference is that favgroups are owned by a single user and that user is the only one who can add or remove posts from it.\r\n\r\nh4. Viewing your favorite groups\r\n\r\nYour favorite groups are listed under \"Fav groups\" in the menu on the main \"/posts\":/posts page, and under Statistics in your user profile.\r\n\r\nYou can search for favorite groups using the {{favgroup:<name>}} or {{favgroup:<id number>}} metatags (see [[help:cheatsheet]]).\r\n\r\nh4. Adding a post to a favorite group\r\n\r\nClick the \"Add to favorite group\" link in the sidebar, then select which group to add the post to (if you only have one group, you won't have to select which group to add to).\r\n\r\nA shortcut is to press the \"g\" key to open the \"Add to favorite group\" dialog, then press a number key (1-9) to select a favorite group.\r\n\r\nYou may also tag a post with {{favgroup:<name>}} to add it to a favgroup. You can use [[help:tag scripts|tag scripting]] to quickly add posts to a favgroup in bulk.\r\n\r\nh4. Removing a post from a favorite group\r\n\r\nTag the post with {{-favgroup:<name>}}. You can use [[help:tag scripts|tag scripting]] to quickly remove posts from a favgroup in bulk.\r\n\r\nYou may also edit the favgroup to remove posts from it. To edit a favgroup, go to the main \"Posts page\":[/posts], click \"Fav groups\" at the top, click on the favgroup in the list, then click \"Edit\" at the top of the page.\r\n\r\nh4. Privacy\r\n\r\nFavgroups are public by default. \"Gold users\":[/user_upgrades/new] and above can make their favorite groups private. To make a favgroup private, go to your \"Fav groups page\":/favorite_groups, click the favorite group you wish to make private, then click \"Edit\" at the top of the page and check the \"Private\" box.\r\n\r\nh4. Limitations\r\n\r\nRegular members may create up to 10 favgroups. Users of higher level have no restriction.
