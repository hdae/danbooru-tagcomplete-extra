They were ostensibly mustered to fight on behalf of the government against the German communists attempting to overthrow the Weimar Republic. However, many Freikorps also largely despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters, later aiding the [[Nazi|NSDAP]] in it’s rise to power.\r\n\r\nModern German historians agree that men of the Freikorps consistently embodied post-Enlightenment masculine ideals that are characterized by \"physical, emotional, and moral 'hardness'\". Men in the Freikorps radicalized Western and German norms of male self-control into a perpetual war against feminine-coded desires for domesticity, tenderness, and compassion amongst men. The Freikorps' displays of violence, terror, and male aggression and solidarity established the beginnings of the fascist New Man upon which the Nazis built.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":232043,"created_at":"2025-03-17T10:13:00.469-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-17T10:13:00.469-04:00","title":"kachimachi_kosuzu_(winter_casual)","body":"The [[casual]] [[official alternate costume|outfit]] worn by [[Kachimachi Kosuzu]] in winter in [[Link!

Zenra fetish features people (usually women) participating in everyday tasks that they might otherwise perform clothed, such as casual scenes with participants playing in an all-nude orchestra in a seemingly oblivious state of mind towards their nudity.\r\n\r\nOthers incorporate the nudity on a more conscious level by doing such things as playing \"[[strip game|strip volleyball]]\", where the participants must remove clothing each time the other team scores a point. While in some case [[sex]] and sexual acts were treated as a normal recreational activity in the setting, including in public places.\r\n\r\nWhile very similar to [[exhibitionism]] and [[nudist|nudism]] in concept and often overlaps with each other, zenra fetish can be distinguished by how the setting treated nudity and sexual activity, as zenra fetish treats nudity either as a social norm at best and a minor inconvenience at worst. In addition, some zenra works also further emphasize sexual elements of the character (such as character exposing their private parts) as another form of beauty standard.\r\n\r\nPlease note that [[bathing]] or tanning on the beach are not zenra as that is normally done naked. In addition, since the word is used as a Pixiv tag for a [[completely nude]] character, only apply \"zenra\" tag if the setting is applicable.\r\n\r\nh6. As a rule of thumb:\r\n* If the person in nude is aware of their nudity and is not in the act that requires them to be in nude (such as [[bathing]]) but does not attempt to cover it and acts as normal, then the tag \"[[nudist]]\" is applicable.\r\n* If the person in nude is in public place, being in presence with other people, or is overtly showing their state of nudity to others, then the tag \"[[exhibitionism]]\" is applicable.\r\n* If the setting of the image treats the state of nudity or sexual act as a normal activity, then the tag \"zenra\" is applicable.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was created by [[Matsumoto Leiji]] and Nishizaki Yoshinobu in the early 1970s. \r\n\r\nThe first TV anime series aired on Yomiuri TV in October 6, 1974 and was followed by several animated movie sequels and two more TV series seasons (broadcast in 1978 and 1980 respectively). \r\n\r\nIt is notable because it was one of the first military science fiction anime that depicted space battleships and cosmic [[battle]]s among fleets of spaceships. Its creators were also inspired by [[Star Trek]] when the series was being developed. \r\n\r\nUchuu Senkan Yamato influenced several later sci-fi anime like [[Gundam]], [[Macross]], [[Top wo Nerae!]] (Gunbuster) and [[Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu]] (Legend of the Galactic Heroes) among others. It also influenced various productions in the west, like [[Star Wars]] and [[Battlestar Galactica]] (both the original and re-imagined versions).\r\n\r\nIt is known to English-speaking audiences as [b]Space Battleship Yamato[/b] and also as [b]Star Blazers[/b]. In Spanish and Latin American countries it was called [b]Astronave Intrepido[/b] (\"Starship Intrepid\"). In European and Asian countries it was also called [b]Estrellas Luminosas[/b] (\"Luminous Stars\"), [b]Cosmoship Yamato[/b], [b]Anti-Space Ship[/b], [b]Journey to the Final Galaxy[/b] and [b]Star Patrol[/b]. \r\n\r\nIts last anime film sequel to the original series was released on December 2009 and a live action film adaptation of the first TV series was released on December 2010 in Japan. \r\n\r\nA new reboot series based on the first season called [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199]] was released in 2012. A  series sequel to 2199 called [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202: Ai no Senshi-Tachi]] was released in 2018. \r\n\r\nThe latest animated film series (sequel to 2202) were released in 2021 with the name [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2205: Arata Naru Tabidachi]].\r\n\r\nh4.Spacecraft\r\n\r\n* [[Yamato (Uchuu Senkan Yamato)|Yamato (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[andromeda (uchuu senkan yamato)|Andromeda (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[Mogami (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[Yukikaze (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[Freedom (Uchuu Senkan Yamato)]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Zero]]\r\n* [[Black Tiger (Yamato)]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Tiger]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Falcon]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Rhino]]\r\n\r\nh4.Characters\r\n\r\n* [[Okita Juuzou]]\r\n* [[Kodai Susumu]]\r\n* [[Kodai Mamoru]]\r\n* [[Mori Yuki]]\r\n* [[Shima Daisuke]]\r\n* [[Sado Sakezou]]\r\n* [[Analyzer (uchuu senkan yamato)|]]\r\n* [[Aihara Yoshikazu]]\r\n* [[Kato Saburou]]\r\n* [[Sanada Shirou]]\r\n* [[Nanbu Yasuo]]\r\n* [[Desler]]\r\n* [[Shultz]]\r\n* [[Starsha]]\r\n* [[Iscandar]]\r\n* [[Yamamoto Akira]]\r\n* [[Niimi Kaoru]]\r\n* [[Harada Makoto]]\r\n* [[Misaki Yuria]]\r\n* [[Itou Shin'ya]]\r\n* [[Miezela Celestella]]\r\n* [[Hilde Schultz]]\r\n* [[Melda Deitz]]\r\n* [[Mirenel Linke]] \r\n* [[Yabu (Uchuu Senkan Yamato)]]\r\n* [[Itou Shin'ya]] \r\n* [[Kiryuu Mikage]]\r\n* [[Saijou Miki]]\r\n* [[Domel]]\r\n* [[Elisa Domel]]\r\n* [[Wolf Fleurken]]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Cosmo Nambu]]\r\n* [[Gamilas]] (Gamilon)\r\n* [[Final Yamato]]\r\n* [[Yamato2520]]\r\n* [[Rebirth Yamato]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202: Ai no Senshi-Tachi]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2205: Arata Naru Tabidachi]]\r\n\r\nh4.

Luffy]]'s transformations from [[One Piece]].\r\n\r\nLuffy coats his arm in [[Haki (one piece)|]] before biting into his forearm.

If Luffy is stopped mid-blowing, the arm will slowly deflate.\r\n\r\nWhen utilizing [[Gear Fourth]], Luffy makes extensive usage of his [[Haki (one piece)|]] by coating his arms, legs and much of his torso in it to the point that they turn black from hardening. The Haki coating across his body resembles the wispy ends made from flames, giving it the appearance of tattoos, and he gains shading around the inner and outer edges of his eyes. He also physically grows taller, standing around 4 meters tall. Similar to when using [[Gear Second]], Luffy is continuously emitting steam in this form. Combined with Luffy's rubbery composition and his compressed muscle structure, [[Gear Fourth]] both adds explosive power to Luffy's attacks and grants him enhanced defensive capabilities far beyond what he can demonstrate with or without [[Gear Second]] or [[Gear Third]].
