Because of this, Itsuki gave her a bell to wear, so that he may know when she was in danger and could go to her aid. Before leaving to help Yae and Sae Kurosawa escape the village, Itsuki gave Chitose the key to his room, with instructions to give it to his friend, Ryozo Munakata. When Ryozo came, however, Chitose got so scared that she hid, unable to give him the key. After the escape attempt, Chitose blamed Yae for having Itsuki wrongfully imprisoned, not understanding how much he wanted to help them escape.\r\n\r\nWhen Sae's ritual failed and the Repentance occurred, Chitose hid inside of a cupboard to escape the coming darkness. She became trapped inside, however, and panicked, scrawling \"help me\" on the walls and frantically calling out for help from her brother. In the end she either starved to death or was swallowed up by the darkness.\r\n\r\nChitose wears a distinct crimson kimono, with pale gold butterfly designs, further alluding the game's theme. Like all ghosts, she appears very pale, and she keeps a sad expression on her face.

It is the most widely produced precision-guided [[missile]] in the Western world, and is effective against a wide range of tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began in 1966 at Hughes as the first missile to use an electronic contrast seeker. It entered service with the [[United States Air Force]] in August 1972. Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft. The Maverick served during the Vietnam, Yom Kippur, Iran–Iraq, and Persian Gulf Wars, along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nSince its introduction into service, numerous Maverick versions had been designed and produced using electro-optical, laser, and imaging infrared guidance systems. The AGM-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating. The missile is currently produced by Raytheon Missile Systems.\r\n\r\nThe Maverick shares the same configuration as Hughes's AIM-4 Falcon and [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], and measures more than 2.4 m (8 ft) in length and 30 cm (12 in) in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Wikipedia\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-65_Maverick]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":133956,"created_at":"2022-01-09T13:22:51.581-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T13:22:51.581-05:00","title":"yachimata_kana","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["八街カナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":133954,"created_at":"2022-01-09T08:19:51.822-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T08:19:51.822-05:00","title":"takauji_cimi","body":"Original character by [[takashi (huzakenna)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":133950,"created_at":"2022-01-09T03:56:25.771-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T03:56:25.771-05:00","title":"komatsu_nana_(actress)","body":"A [[real life]] Japanese actress and model.\r\n\r\nh4.External Links\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Komatsu]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["小松菜奈"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":41034,"created_at":"2012-12-16T19:40:15.725-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-09T02:00:56.078-05:00","title":"glenda_(puchi_puri_yucie)","body":"The princess of the [[Demon]] World with elegant beauty and fantastic magical powers.

He isn't taken very seriously, and Zed fights the party numerous times to accomplish his goals. While he is a powerful opponent, he mainly acts as the game's comic relief.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Zed gives up on being a Quarter Knight, but when he finds the blind girl [[Aura (Wild Arms)|Aura]] living alone in Saint Centaur, he protects her from outside threats. In this regard, he finally becomes the great person he always wanted to be (if only in his mind).\r\n\r\nIn both versions, Zed can be fought as an optional boss in Saint Centaur, but the outcomes are different. In the original, he gives [[Jack Van Burace]] his sword Doom Bringer. In the remake, he joins the party.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ゼット"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":17263,"created_at":"2010-03-14T23:31:50.489-04:00","updated_at":"2022-01-07T16:21:33.817-05:00","title":"hikari_no_4_senshi","body":"光の4戦士\r\nlit.

For over 20 years HMS Hood was the largest warship in the world, and the pride of the British Empire. Due to her flagship duties she never got the chance to get various large scale upgrades and refits that she desperately needed to stay a relevant combat unit.  Hood's primary actions during her career were the cruise across world with HMS Repulse in 1923-1924, patrols during Spanish Civil War, taking part in the Operation Catapult (attack on Mers-el-Kebir after France had surrendered to Germans) during which she might have sunk French battleship Bretagne, and Battle of Denmark Strait which saw her rather explosive end after she and freshly commissioned battleship HMS Prince of Wales engaged German battleship Bismarck and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen.\r\n\r\nWhile popular among the British public and the symbol of British Empire during the interwar years HMS Hood was however a rather flawed ship; her hasty up-armoring after the Battle of Jutland had left her with both rather obsolete armor scheme and several thousand tons overweight, this made HMS Hood rather wet ship (especially in harsh North Atlantic waters) and during her whole career Hood was plagued with unusually high rates of tuberculosis infections among her crew when compared to other Royal Navy vessels. Hood was also the reason why during WNT Britain was only allowed to build 2 battleships with 16\" guns (the ratio of post-Jutland capital ships being 3-3-2 between USA, UK, and Japan).","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":30930,"created_at":"2011-12-12T06:22:14.039-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-01T04:19:04.864-05:00","title":"wenu_(kirikirimai)","body":"Artist,
