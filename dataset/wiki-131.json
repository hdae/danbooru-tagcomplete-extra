Completed in October 31st of 1942, and was sunk by the submarine [i]USS Skate[/i] on February 16th 1944 while heading to Japan from Truk to receive repairs from damage in the Solomons campaign.  \r\n\r\nThey were among the last light cruisers the IJN ever developed, and were heavier than most light cruisers, but were consequently under-armed and under-armored for their weight, as the IJN did not increase those capabilities as much as the mass.  The Agano class was characteristic for having only a single [[smokestack]], as the light cruiser design was re-evaluated to have less clutter on the decks, be less overweight for its hull, and hence, have better stability in open seas.\r\n\r\nIn real life, Agano and her sisters were to have replaced the aging [i]Tenryuu[/i], [i]Kuma[/i], and [i]Nagara[/i] classes of light cruisers as destroyer squadron and submarine squadron flagships. Only her sisters Noshiro and Yahagi were able to fulfill that said role, however.\r\nShe was completed in mid-1942 and thrown into the front lines of the Guadalcanal and Solomons campaigns, eventually seeing action in the battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 2 November 1943. Just a few days later, she sustained severe damage from an air attack by US carriers and was forced to withdraw to Truk.\r\n\r\nNot fully repaired, she was again attacked by US naval forces in Truk on February 1944 and sunk while retreating to Japan, with the destroyer Oite rescuing more than 500 survivors. The next day, Oite herself was sunk with all of the Agano survivors. \r\n\r\nh4.See Also:\r\n* [[Agano (Kancolle)]]\r\n* [[Agano (Azur Lane)]]\r\n* \"Wikipedia: IJN [i]Agano[/i]\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Agano]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":144260,"created_at":"2022-05-25T04:44:58.679-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T23:54:16.449-04:00","title":"scorch_mark","body":"Burn marks on an object or scenery.\r\n\r\nSee [[burn scar]] for when a character has burn scars.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["scorch_marks","scorched_mark","scorched_marks"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145756,"created_at":"2022-06-22T23:23:51.846-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T23:23:51.846-04:00","title":"cor_leonis","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["コル・リオニス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145755,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:51:07.983-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:51:07.983-04:00","title":"taishakuten_(housamo)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["タイシャクテン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145754,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:35:53.135-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:35:53.135-04:00","title":"hachisuke","body":"Hachisuke, also known as [b]Hu-Bee[/b], is the mascot of the video game developer company [[Hudson]], who also appears on the company's logo.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ハチ助"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145753,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:20:38.185-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:20:38.185-04:00","title":"asakura_miyuko","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["浅倉美由子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145752,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:19:15.264-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:19:15.264-04:00","title":"asakura_tokiori","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["浅倉時織"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145749,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:12:46.977-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:15:45.465-04:00","title":"sorrowchat_(vocaloid)","body":"A [[vocaloid]] song by MIMI featuring [[Hatsune Miku]].\r\n\r\n\"YouTube\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5xaccIl1Ps\r\n\"Niconico\":https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm37839425\r\n\r\nh4.
