Axis forces first contained the Soviet beachhead throughout the winter and interdicted its naval supply lines through aerial bombing. From January through April, the Crimean Front launched repeated offensives against the 11th Army, all of which failed with heavy losses. The Red Army lost 352,000 men in the attacks, while the Axis suffered 24,120 casualties. Superior German artillery firepower was largely responsible for the Soviet debacle.\r\n\r\nOn 8 May 1942, the Axis struck with great force in a major counteroffensive codenamed Trappenjagd which concluded by around 19 May 1942 with the liquidation of the Soviet defending forces and [[victory]] for the Wehrmacht.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["刻赤","刻赤攻防戦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170892,"created_at":"2023-08-19T02:35:16.137-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-19T02:35:16.137-04:00","title":"ishitobi_kanna","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["石飛閑無"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170890,"created_at":"2023-08-19T02:32:31.547-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-19T02:32:31.547-04:00","title":"inamura_kyouka","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["稲村杏果"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170889,"created_at":"2023-08-19T02:25:42.551-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-19T02:30:17.129-04:00","title":"siege_of_odessa","body":"[b]The Siege of Odessa[/b], also known to the [[Soviet]]s as [b]The Defense of Odessa[/b], lasted from 8 August until 16 October 1941, during the early phase of \"Operation Barbarossa\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa , the Axis invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]].\r\n\r\nOdessa was a port on the Black Sea in the Ukrainian SSR.

He either self-imposes or is imposed with the behavioral conduct of a military man who complies with others' wills. As a result of that, in the past there were many who relied on him for power, which also resulted in many toying with his determination. But over in Ikebukuro where Fergus's memories and experiences are suitable for him, he seems to be glorifying the life of a student. Perhaps of his role as a prophet, there are occasions where he glimpses at fragments of memories of times not set in the present. Every time the pain that springs back up from the difference between love and friendship reappears, he repeats his misunderstanding as he wonders if it is some kind of vision. He is a man whose constant catchphrase is \"youth\" and sees dreams of an adolescence he cannot return to. He holds good will towards those who honor a single choice like he does. He has a strange, frequent connection to the number seven, the number before eight.

Uploading\r\n\r\nThe uploading process has been simplified for ArtStation. Upload with the \"danbooru bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], or paste in the URL of the work you wish to upload in the upload page. This way, you don't have to upload the image from your computer and risk it being an [[image sample]]. If you wish to upload a project with multiple images, the batch bookmarklet will make this much easier.\r\n\r\nIf after uploading the source is a direct image URL or blank, it should be changed to the HTML URL of the work. There are two types of HTML URL pages for projects on ArtStation. The www version represents the main site, in addition to pages based on a custom domain name for the artist. On the custom domain name gallery, the artist can make some images available not on the www gallery. Either URL should technically work and detect artist names, however the artist subdomain is able to be changed. Below is an example of a preferred source:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/EJ6Jn\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nYou can observe that the alternative URL structure is simply borrowed from the other by comparing them, as shown below by the same project on the different pages.\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nhttps://deel.artstation.com/projects/EJ6Jn\r\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/EJ6Jn\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nUse the artist tag detected under [b]Related Tags[/b], if there is one. If there is none, you may refer to the rest of this article on how to choose an artist name and make an entry for them.\r\n\r\nRemember to [[howto:tag|tag]] the rest of your upload and follow the rest of the procedures under [[help:upload]].\r\n\r\nh4. Artist naming and entry\r\n\r\nIf there are no other active accounts on which an artist posts, the name listed in their profile will usually be sufficient for their artist name. If their ArtStation account has been found linked from one their other accounts such as DeviantArt or Pixiv than their ArtStation URLs (seen below) should be appended to their existing artist entry. See \"Artist tagging help\":/forum_topics/8199 thread if you are unsure or think an artist name should be changed.\r\n\r\nThere are two URLs for an ArtStation artist that should be included in their artist entry list of URLs. One starts with www and the other is a customization subdomain. Unlike Pixiv however direct links to images should not be included. Below is an example for one artist:\r\n* https://www.artstation.com/geosiador\r\n* https://geosiador.artstation.com/\r\n\r\n[b]Note[/b]: Artists on ArtStation are able to edit their usernames on the site. When this happens both the above URLs will change and should subsequently be added to their artist entry, however the old ones should not be removed.\r\n\r\nSometimes an artists other accounts may be listed in the About subheading on their ArtStation profile. This could help find an existing artist entry or should be appended to the artist's URL list.\r\n\r\nh4. Legacy \"/original/\" files\r\nAt its launch, ArtStation had higher-resolution or quality version of images sometimes available. This allowed users to sometimes upload much higher quality versions of images form the source. Many images uploaded prior to suspension of this file thankfully remain on Danbooru as legacy content from that time, despite no longer being available from ArtStation. See below for the legacy instructions on uploading these images, which was later automated by the recommended bookmarklet:\r\n\r\n[expand]\r\nArtStation has reduced-size versions of its images known as [[artstation sample]]s, none of which should be uploaded here.\r\n\r\nTo find the full image URL, you must manually alter part of the image URL (typically [b]/large/[/b] or [b]/4k/[/b]) to [b]/original/[/b].

It is one of the newest sources of images for Danbooru.\r\n\r\nThis page will describe how to upload from Drawcrowd, in addition to how to handle new artist entries in the case an entry doesn't already exist for the artist you're uploading a work from.\r\n\r\n[b]As Drawcrowd is still new, it is important to read these instructions carefully.[/b] One of the peculiar intricacies about Drawcrowd is that the download button is misleading and does not download the actual, full and original image. The original images are kept hidden to mitigate bandwidth costs.\r\n\r\nh4. Uploading\r\n\r\nHere's the ideal procedure when uploading from Drawcrowd.\r\nDrawcrowd has reduced-size versions of its images known as [[drawcrowd sample]]s, none of which should be uploaded here.\r\n\r\nTo find the full image URL, you must manually alter part of the image URL (typically [b]/large/[/b]) to [b]/original/[/b]. If the [b]/original/[/b] returns a [b]file not found[/b] error, then the [b]/large/[/b] image is accepted as the original.\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Change the source from the direct image URL to the HTML URL of the work.  It should look like the following:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[nodtext]https://drawcrowd.com/projects/mtq1mtg5ltctmjatndq[/nodtext]\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] Use the artist tag detected under [b]Related Tags[/b], if there is one. If there is none, you may refer to the rest of this article on how to choose an artist name and make an entry for them.\r\n\r\n[b]4.[/b] Remember to [[howto:tag|tag]] the rest of your upload and follow the rest of the procedures under [[help:upload]].\r\n\r\nh4. Artist naming and entry\r\n\r\nIf there are no other active accounts on which an artist posts, the name listed in their profile will usually be sufficient for their artist name. If their Drawcrowd account has been found linked from one their other accounts such as DeviantArt or Pixiv than their ArtStation URLs (seen below) should be appended to their existing artist entry. See \"Artist tagging help\":/forum_topics/8199 thread if you are unsure or think an artist name should be changed.\r\n\r\nThere is one URL for a Drawcrowd artist that should be included in their artist entry list of URLs. Below is an example for one artist:\r\n\r\n* [nodtext]https://drawcrowd.com/liberea[/nodtext]\r\n\r\nSometimes an artists other accounts may be listed in the About subheading on their Drawcrowd profile. This could help find an existing artist entry or should be appended to the artist's URL list.\r\n\r\nh4.

Sourcing\r\n\r\nThe ideal procedure when uploading from e-Hentai is as follows.\r\n \r\n1. [b]Under no circumstances is it recommended to upload from e-Hentai using image URLs.[/b] e-Hentai image URLs are extremely finicky, and trying to upload from e-Hentai using an image URL greatly increases your chances of uploading an [[e-hentai sample]].\r\n \r\n2. Instead, download the image using the \"Download original XXXX x YYYY X.XX MB source\" button at the bottom of an image page, and then upload the file to Danbooru from your computer.\r\n \r\n3. On the upload page, you can input the URL of the page containing the image, which should look as follows:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nhttps://e-hentai.org/s/4fbd8a7e43/1132165-7\r\n[/quote]\r\n \r\n4. Do not use gallery URLs as sources. Use gallery URLs in pool descriptions when pooling posts from a comic, artbook, or doujinshi uploaded from e-Hentai. Gallery URLs should look as follows:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nhttps://e-hentai.org/g/1132165/6a659287cf/\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4. Pooling\r\n\r\nIf you upload most or all of a comic, artbook, or doujinshi from e-Hentai, you should group your uploads into a pool. Your pool description should include the original name of the comic/artbook/doujinshi, a link to the corresponding e-Hentai gallery, and a short description of the material.

Its functionality has been replaced by \"saved searches\":[/wiki_pages/83158].\r\n\r\nWith a [[help:users|Gold account]] you can subscribe to a group of tag searches. A background process runs once per day to refresh your tag subscriptions providing you a listing of the 200 most recent posts matching your searches. You can think of a tag subscription as a bookmark to a tag search, but coupled with the full power of Danbooru's tag query engine.\r\n\r\nYou can create up to five groups and each group can have up to 20 searches. Any search that works in the post listing will work with tag subscriptions, which means any metatag will work. You can even create tag subscriptions based on other people's tag subscriptions.\r\n\r\nYou can search your own tag subscriptions using the sub: metatag from the main post listing. To search for albert's tag subscriptions for example, search for [i]sub:albert[/i]. To search albert's touhou tag subscription group, you can search for [i]sub:albert:touhou[/i]. Because the posts are rendered through the main listing, you can also view the Atom feed, the Piclens feed, and all API calls will work as expected. And like any other metatag, you can combine it with other tags (to a degree).\r\n\r\nEach search should go on a separate line. So if you put two tags on the same line, it will only match posts with both those tags. But if you put two tags on separate lines, it will match posts with either of the two tags.\r\n\r\nTo edit your tag subscriptions, visit your \"tag subscriptions\":/tag_subscriptions page.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":5646,"created_at":"2007-08-09T13:22:32.022-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-12T19:01:23.728-04:00","title":"help:tag_scripts","body":"Tag scripts allow you to quickly add and remove tags to posts by clicking on their thumbnails.

There are 50 results per page.\r\n\r\nFor images that have been deleted (i.e., bad id), or if you query for a R-18 image but don't pass a valid PHPSESSID, the API returns a \"200 OK\" HTTP code but an empty response.  Private images (MyPicks, etc...) have an illust id of 0 and a generic thumbnail.\r\n\r\nResponses are unlabeled CSV documents.\r\n\r\n[expand=Example

The player controls [[Sakai Jin]], a [[samurai]] on a quest to protect Tsushima Island during the \"first Mongol invasion\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Japan#First_invasion_(1274) of [[Japan]]. \r\n\r\nJin must choose between following the warrior code to fight honorably, or using practical but dishonorable methods of repelling the Mongols with minimal casualties. The game features a large open world which can be explored either on foot or on horseback. When facing enemies, the player can choose to engage in a direct confrontation using Jin's [[katana]] or to become a legendary warrior known as \"the Ghost\" by using stealth tactics to assassinate opponents. \r\n\r\nSucker Punch began developing the game  in 2014 with a heavy emphasis on melee combat. The studio collaborated with \"Japan Studio\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Studio and visited Tsushima Island twice to ensure that the game was as culturally and historically authentic as possible. The team was heavily inspired by samurai cinema, particularly films directed by \"Kurosawa Akira\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa , as well as the comic book series [[Usagi Yojimbo]]. The game's landscape and minimalistic art style were influenced by [[Shadow of the Colossus]], and locations in the game were designed to be \"the perfect photographer's dream\". While the in-game landmass is similar in shape to \"Tsushima Island\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsushima_Island , the team did not intend to create a one-to-one recreation. Ilan Eshkeri and Umebayashi Shigeru composed the game's soundtrack.\r\n\r\nThe game was released for [[PlayStation 4]] in July 2020, and an expanded version for PlayStation 4 and [[PlayStation 5]], subtitled Director's Cut and featuring the \"Iki Island\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iki_Island expansion, was released in August 2021. A multiplayer mode titled Ghost of Tsushima: Legends was released in October 2020 and made available separately in September 2021.\r\n\r\nThe game received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's melee combat, story, characters, performances, and music, though it received some criticism for its implementations of stealth gameplay and open world structure.

Released on September 11, 1977. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM [[game cartridge]]s containing [[video game]] code, a format first used with the [i]Fairchild Channel F[/i] video game console in 1976. \r\n\r\nThis format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit (like in very early [[Pong]] game consoles).\r\n\r\nThe 2600 was a black and wood colored console typically bundled with [[television]] connectors and power [[cable]]s, two joystick [[game controller]]s, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge (initially \"Combat\", and later \"[[pac-man_(game)|Pac-Man]]\"). \r\n\r\nIt was a very popular and successful machine. However, due to a cheap loyalty fee (that any game makers must paid to console owners for making a game for their system) and lack of quality control, the Atari 2600 was flooded with countless shovelwares that started to destroy its reputation. \r\n\r\nThe release of the infamous [[E.T.]] video game (which Atari rushed in its development and produced too many copies of it for sale) it was later one of the causes for the subsequent \"North America video game crash of 1983\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983 , after which the system's popularity diminished greatly. By 1985 it was all but forgotten, but this paved the way for the introduction of more advanced and popular consoles like the [[Nintendo]] [[Famicom]] ([[NES]]) in the mid 80s.  \r\n\r\nh4.

She dislikes everyone, even including the god of harvest Kamael.

There was a time when Mayreel used to like humans since anyone who set their eyes on Mayreel would immediately fall in love with her adorable figure. But a long time ago, some crowd of people abused Bari's compassion and wished for outrageous things wasting Bari's memory. If Mayreel did not punish them on time, Bari would have not even remembered Mayreel and Kamael. Since then Mayreel became wary of humans to protect Bari from the selfish species.\r\n\r\nMayreel hates her human form. She constantly whines about how it's uncomfortable and cumbersome to be in a human form, about how many customs she has to uphold. That's probably why she looks so annoyed and wears her priest outfit sloppily when Bari asks her to turn into her human form. Bari tidies up Mayreel's outfit whenever she can, but in a blink of a second Mayreel will untidy her clothes. Although she, certainly, is a handful, Bari stills love the way she is.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["メイリル(ガーディアンテイルズ)","メイリル","풍요의_신수_메이릴","메이릴","豊ほう作さくの神しん獣_メイリル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123753,"created_at":"2021-04-25T11:23:20.124-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T13:23:36.597-04:00","title":"movie_star_eugene","body":"Eugene is a movie star in Burywood.\r\n\r\nBefore she made her way into the stardom, she endured long and arduous period as a stunt double.

She continued to work with Vale on \"Queensman\" which was another instant hit.\r\n\r\nHer career dwindled when she signed a contract with the infamous Invader Pictures, Inc. She had constant clash with the studio while shooting the film \"War of Stars.\" The movie was eventually cancelled and her streak seemed to be over as well. Her career revived when she rejoined with Vale for the indie film \"Guardian Story\" where she played a young aspiring guardian.\r\n\r\nDue to her roles as heroes, she has cemented her image as an honest and righteous hero. However, Eugene mentioned in one interview that she actually enjoys B rated gore/kaiju films and that she would love to play a villain.\r\n\r\nShe is known to be a very positive and hard working person. Because of her prolonged stunt career she is extremely durable, a master of various weapons, and an expert bike rider.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ムービースターユジン(ガーディアンテイルズ)","ユジン(ガーディアンテイルズ)","ムービースター_ユジン","영화_배우_유진","유진"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170132,"created_at":"2023-08-05T13:15:25.010-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T13:15:25.010-04:00","title":"dragon_avatar_vishuvac","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ビシュバーク(ガーディアンテイルズ)","ビシュバーク","竜りゅうの化け身_ビシュバーク","비슈바크","용의","화신_비슈바크"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170131,"created_at":"2023-08-05T13:06:37.392-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T13:06:37.392-04:00","title":"ibye","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["艾白"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170130,"created_at":"2023-08-05T12:51:10.034-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T12:51:10.034-04:00","title":"sniper_hekate","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["스나이퍼_헤카테","スナイパー_ヘカテ","ヘカテ(ガーディアンテイルズ)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123747,"created_at":"2021-04-25T11:03:45.328-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T12:47:55.854-04:00","title":"flower_girl_bari","body":"Bari is a high priestess of the god of harvest.

Bari always tries to remain distant to her clients to avoid getting involved with humans but often fails due to her compassionate nature.

You should not get frustrated if she doesn't remember you - it just means she cherished the memory with you and passed the happiness to another in need.\r\n\r\nShe has two rules when granting wishes. One - if her client becomes greedy and attempts to exploit her, she will make sure the client pay for the sin whether it's by her own hand or by curse of mother nature. Two - she won't bring anyone back from dead. It always made clients' lives worse.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["꽃집_아가씨","바리","花はなの乙おと女","バリ","バリ(ガーディアンテイルズ)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170129,"created_at":"2023-08-05T12:41:38.086-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T12:41:38.086-04:00","title":"rin_(vtuber)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["琳"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170128,"created_at":"2023-08-05T12:08:00.543-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T12:08:00.543-04:00","title":"wenjing","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["文静"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170127,"created_at":"2023-08-05T11:41:05.536-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T11:41:05.536-04:00","title":"iris_(vtuber)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["艾瑞思"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170126,"created_at":"2023-08-05T11:40:44.884-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T11:40:44.884-04:00","title":"qianniao_official","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["千鸟战队","千鸟Official"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":170125,"created_at":"2023-08-05T11:35:31.907-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-05T11:35:31.907-04:00","title":"american_le_mans_series","body":"A now-defunct American [[car]] [[racing]] motorsports series, created in 1999 as a successor to the [[IMSA GT Championship]].
