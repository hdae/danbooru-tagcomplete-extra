Synopsis\r\n\r\nThroughout history, humans have been at odds with Beastmen—a species capable of changing shape due to their genetic \"Beast Factor.\" Because of this conflict, Beastmen have been forced into hiding. Anima City serves as a safe haven for these oppressed individuals to live free from human interference.\r\n\r\nDuring a festival celebrating the town's 10th anniversary, [[Kagemori Michiru]], a human who suddenly turned into a [[tanuki]], finds that Anima City is a far cry from paradise. After witnessing an explosion in the square, she is confronted by [[Ogami Shirou]], a seemingly indestructible [[wolf]] and sworn protector of all Beastmen. As they pursue the criminals behind the bombing, the two discover that Michiru is anything but an ordinary Beastman, and look to investigate her mysterious past and uncanny abilities. Could she turn out to be the missing link between Humans and Beastmen?\r\n\r\nh4.

It's designed to take a weaker load of 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester) to compensate for the weaker constitution of the Japanese soldiers. Not only that but the rifles were also plagued with unreliability due to the rifle design; noted that unlike the other variants of the FN FAL, the Type 64 bolt carrier also located on top of its reciever, thus resulting in two main issues: first, the brass ejected is sent right overhead of the shooter, which may potentially injures him/her in the process and second, such design allows dust, rain and whatnot to enter the gun and causes it to malfunction. On a side note, the use of alloy and other space age materials to achieve the goal of weight reduction for the Type 64 might as well be for naught as in order to actually shoot the rifle accurately, not only the JSDF have to opt for a low-power 7.62 NATO but a permanent bipod must also be attached and this alone negates any weight advantages that the gun might have.\r\n\r\nNowadays it's being continually replaced with the newer Type 89.\r\n\r\n* Caliber: 7,62x51 mm\r\n* Action: Gas operated, tilting bolt\r\n* Overall length: 990 mm\r\n* Barrel length: 450 mm\r\n* Weight: 4,3 kg less magazine\r\n* Rate of fire: 450-500 rounds per minute\r\n* [[magazine_(weapon)|Magazine]] capacity: 20 rounds\r\n\r\nh4.
