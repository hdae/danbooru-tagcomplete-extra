The first set of synthesizer vocals was released in January 2004.\r\n\r\nOn August 31st, 2007, [[Hatsune Miku]] was released for the VOCALOID2 engine. As the first product in Crypton Future Media's Character Vocal Series, she was the first voicebank designed with an anime-styled avatar representing the singer of the voicebank. Her immediate and immense popularity led to nearly all future voicebanks following the same trend of having an anime-styled avatar, a trend that still continues to this day.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of VOCALOID has inspired the creation of [[List of vocal synthesizers|similar products]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Her [[rigging]] consists of all three of her planned 457 mm twin mounts, four 127 mm twin [[anti-aircraft gun|DP mounts]], two funnels, and her bridge with its associated [[radar]] set.\r\n\r\nPersonality-wise, she expresses great pride in her capabilities (not too dissimilar to [[Monarch_(azur_lane)|]]) and a desire to see the world. She also has a craving for Oxy-Cola, a reference to her namesake state housing the bottling plants for [[Coca-Cola]].  She has a rather unique fashion sense as shown in her skins, with unconventional takes on the skin themes.\r\n\r\nh4. Info\r\nShe represents the original design of the [i]Iowa[/i]-class battleships of the US Navy, equipped with three 457 mm twin mount guns compared to [i]Iowa's[/i] three 406 mm triple guns. The design was abandoned after it was determined that heavier 457 mm shells had no notable performance improvements over the planned Mk8 \"Super-Heavy\" shells, among other reasons.\r\n\r\nAs a reference to her [[World of Warships]] counterpart upon which she's based, Georgia receives a skill similar to the \"Artillery Plotting Room Modification 2\", which provides an improvement to her accuracy. In game, she's a rather high performance if straight forward battleship. And the 18in cannons associated with her is considered the strongest AP ammo gun in the game.\r\n\r\nh4.

On 3 October 1993, a [[UH-60 Blackhawk]] [[helicopter]] operating in support of US forces raiding Somali militias was struck by a [[rpg (weapon)|RPG]] and crashed in the middle of the hostile city of Mogadishu. The next 24 hours saw the fiercest fighting America had experienced since the [[Vietnam War]], costing the lives of eighteen Americans from the task force, and one Malaysian and one Pakistani from the UN rescue force, with over 90 combined US and UN wounded. Estimates for Somali deaths range from 133 to over 700. One American pilot from the second downed [[helicopter]] was captured by Somali forces. The battle dealt the effective end of UN efforts to end Somalia's civil war, and would have a drastic effect on American foreign policy for the rest of the 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe story of the battle was told in a 1999 book by journalist Mark Bowden, titled [i]Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War[/i], which was then adapted into a movie by the same name in 2001 by director Ridley Scott. In addition, the 2003 video game [[delta force (video game)|Delta Force: Black Hawk Down]] depicts a fictionalized version of the Somali civil war, as is the same series' reboot campaign releasing in 2025.\r\n\r\nh4.

World War Two-era Carbines had a clean barrel from the stock to the muzzle and simple flip-tab rear sights, though later versions added a [[bayonet]] lug and more advanced graduated rear sights. The standard feed system is a 15-round box [[magazine (weapon)|magazine]].\r\n\r\n* The M1A1 Carbine is the variant that features a metal side-[[folding stock]] and a pistol grip.\r\n* The [[M2 Carbine]] is the name given to Carbines made capable of firing on full-automatic.

These adventures were continued by the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. The original series were influential in both the west and the east. In Japan it inspired the famous [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]] classic anime series. \r\n\r\nFour more television series were eventually produced, based in the same universe but following other characters: [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]], following the crew of a new Starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] and [[Star Trek: Voyager]], set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise, set before the original series, in the early days of human interstellar travel. \r\n\r\nFour additional feature films were produced, following the crew of The Next Generation, and most recently a 2009 movie reboot of the franchise featuring the young crew of the original Enterprise set in an [[star trek: kelvin timeline|alternate timeline]]. \r\n\r\nThe newest Star Trek television revival, beginning in 2017, includes the series [[Star Trek: Discovery]], [[Star Trek: Picard|Picard]], Short Treks, [[Star Trek: Lower Decks|Lower Decks]], Prodigy, and [[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds|Strange New Worlds]], streaming on digital platforms.\r\n\r\nThe franchise also includes dozens of computer and video games, hundreds of novels, as well as a themed attraction in Las Vegas (closed in September 2008). Beginning with the original television series and continuing with the subsequent films and series, the franchise has created a cult phenomenon and has spawned many pop culture references.\r\nh4.

In a career spanning more than fifty years, he was awarded numerous accolades, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 and an Honorary Academy Award in 2019. Often described as a \"visionary\", Lynch was considered one of the most important filmmakers of his era.\r\n\r\nLynch studied painting before he began making short films in the late 1960s. His first feature-length film was the independent surrealist film [[Eraserhead]] (1977), which saw success as a midnight movie. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for the biographical drama The Elephant Man (1980), the neo-noir thriller Blue Velvet (1986), and the surrealist mystery Mulholland Drive (2001). His romantic crime drama Wild at Heart (1990) won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He also directed [[Dune (1984 movie)|the 1984 adaptation of Dune]], the surrealist neo-noir Lost Highway (1997), the biographical drama The Straight Story (1999), and the experimental film Inland Empire (2006).\r\n\r\nLynch and Mark Frost created the ABC series [[Twin Peaks]] (1990–91), for which he was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.

Adobe, recognizing that Flash lost its relevance over time, announced in 2017 that in-browser Flash plugins would no longer be supported after December 2020; all major browsers permanently removed Flash support by the end of January 2021.\r\n\r\nDuring its lifetime, Adobe made a change to the Flash player after version 9 that broke many older files. As of now, the 51 posts with this tag have been fixed by flipping a flag in the header, as detailed in topic #15331, but if such a file was found, it was recommended to try and view it in version 9's stand-alone player.\r\n\r\nAs of March 2021, Danbooru is set up to automatically load all Flash posts using Ruffle.js, which uses \"WebAssembly\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly] to emulate Flash in modern browsers as a part of the broader \"Ruffle Project\":[https://ruffle.rs]. While this means you can view Flash posts without falling back on an outdated browser that's old enough to still support the original Flash Player, please keep in mind that Ruffle's core emulation of Flash [b]is still in an alpha state[/b] and it's less likely to work with files that are newer and/or more complex.
