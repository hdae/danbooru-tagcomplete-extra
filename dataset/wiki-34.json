There's also no other kids her age where she lives, so she became an idol because she heard that doing so would help her make many friends.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be too far-fetched to call Tamaki the most child-like child among the younger idols -- she is innocent, energetic, and full of curiosity. Tamaki likes to play outdoors, watch sentai shows, and be the leader of a Sentai squad. She also loves all kind animals (including frogs and insects), which is why she gets along especially well with [[Kousaka Umi]] and [[Ganaha Hibiki]].\r\n\r\nTamaki feels embarrassed to be seen in a dress, but also shows interest to becoming more girly. She also seems to be becoming aware that her feelings for the [[Producer (idolmaster)|]] might be something more than just an innocent feelings of friendship. However, for the most part, she's still just a child.\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\nh5.

She is a giant, beauty-obsessed wasp queen who has been terrorizing the [[people of the sky]] well before the events of the main story. Said main story kicks off when the people have had enough of her tyranny and decide to summon a hero with the Dreamstalk.\r\n\r\nHearing about this rebellion, the twisted queen sends her trusted servant [[Taranza]] to capture this hero. When Taranza fails her by mistaking [[King Dedede]] as the hero (and thus incurring the wrath of [[Kirby]]), Sectonia supposedly offs her servant and takes matters into her own hands.\r\n\r\nAfter a long, drawn-out battle [[flowered sectonia|(which included Sectonia fusing with the Dreamstalk)]], Kirby defeats her with his newly-discovered Hypernova [[copy_ability|ability]]. She has an additional form in The True Arena, called [[Soul of Sectonia]].\r\n\r\nQueen Sectonia is implied to have looked much different in the past, less like a wasp, and more like [[Taranza]].

In fact, she was rather benevolent to her people. It was thanks to constantly gazing in the [[Dimension Mirror]] (gifted to her by Taranza) that pushed her down the path of villainy. Whether or not [[Dark Meta Knight]] or [[Dark Mind]] (who is implied to be still alive in the form of King D-Mind) is responsible for this remains unknown.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[spoiler]DNA informaton (courtesy of the Haltmann Works Company) suggests that she acquired her wasp form through magic and feeding off of countless hosts. When her clone is defeated in [i][[Kirby: Planet Robobot]][/i], she shows her base \"Old Friend\" form like the [[Dark Matter (kirby)|]] clone did for itself in the prior fight.

Tagging human characters\r\n* Use English names for human characters, with the (pokemon) qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[sabrina_(pokemon)]], [[brock_(pokemon)]], etc.\r\n* Use English names for trainer classes, with the (pokemon) qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[lass_(pokemon)]], [[swimmer_(pokemon)]], [[fisher_(pokemon)]], etc.\r\n* As an exception, human characters with surnames don't have the qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[tracey_sketchit]], [[blue_oak]], etc. (not [[blue_oak_(pokemon)]])\r\n\r\nPokémon tags were formerly partly grandfathered-in tags, where human characters were originally referred to by their Japanese names in compliance with usual Danbooru standards, despite having English names on exported versions. The English names were sometimes available as aliases, especially in the case of major characters such as players and rivals. However, as raised in topic #17160, this created an inconsistency with the use of the English names of the Pokémon themselves and other terms used in the franchise as well as several other factors that had to be addressed, thus the reversal, marking Pokémon tags as completely grandfathered-in copyright tags. See our [[howto:copyright|Copyright Tag Guidelines]] for more info about \"grandfathered-in copyright tags\".\r\n\r\nMost human characters are known by a single name (they lack a full name) such as \"Misty\" and would be likely ambiguous with characters from other copyrights, hence the (pokemon) qualifier.\r\n\r\nTrainer classes are often descriptive words such as \"Swimmer\" or \"Lass\", so English trainer classes are used. They would often clash with common English vocabulary, so the (pokemon) qualifier is used here as well.\r\n\r\nSee [[List of Pokemon characters|List of Pokémon characters]] for all names.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging Pokémon species\r\n* Simply use the English names of Pokémon species.\r\n** Ex.: [[pikachu]], [[mewtwo]], etc.\r\n* There are ten species that require the (pokemon) qualifier:\r\n** [[gloom_(pokemon)]], [[golem_(pokemon)]],  [[electrode_(pokemon)]], [[kabuto_(pokemon)]], [[mew_(pokemon)]], [[roselia_(pokemon)]], [[deino_(pokemon)]], [[chi-yu_(pokemon)]], [[ting-lu_(pokemon)]] and [[iron_hands_(pokemon)]].\r\n\r\n* For a regional form, use just \"alolan_(species)\", \"galarian_(species)\", \"hisuian_(species)\" or \"paldean_(species)\". Don't use just \"(species)\".\r\n** Ex.: Alolan Meowth should be tagged just [[alolan_meowth]], not [[meowth]].\r\n** Ex.: Galarian Meowth should be tagged just [[galarian_meowth]], not [[meowth]].\r\n** Ex.: Hisuian Braviary should be tagged just [[hisuian_braviary]], not [[braviary]].\r\n** Ex.: Paldean Wooper should be tagged just [[paldean_wooper]], not [[wooper]].\r\n\r\nOwing to their sheer number (1025 registered species, as of the Scarlet and Violet versions), remembering their English names is no easy task, much less their Japanese names. The Japanese names of Pokémon also cover many highly-ambiguous words that can and will conflict with other characters, artists, and objects. (Beedrill = \"Spear\" in Japanese; Magnemite = \"Coil\" in Japanese, etc.)\r\n\r\nHistorically, Japanese names had been applicable to newer Pokémon as temporary tags, when necessary, until their English names became officially available. However, in the latest generations, the English and Japanese names have been usually released at the same time.\r\n\r\nSome miscellaneous tags about Pokémon species, such as [[shiny_pokemon]] and [[clothed_pokemon]], are also available.\r\n\r\nSee [[list_of_pokemon|List of Pokémon]] for all names.\r\n\r\nh4. Tagging media\r\n\r\n* Use game tags to group human characters and designs from various games.\r\n** Ex.: [[pokemon_rgby]], [[pokemon_sm]], [[pokemon_swsh]], etc.\r\n* Use anime series tags to group human characters and designs from different anime series.\r\n** Ex.: [[pokemon_(classic_anime)]], [[pokemon_dppt_(anime)]], [[pokemon_sm_(anime)]], etc.\r\n* Other media tags are available as well:\r\n** Ex.: [[pokemon_adventures]], [[pokemon_pocket_monsters]], etc.\r\n* Make sure to check the different designs of each character to see where it fits.\r\n** Ex.: Red is visibly different in [i]RGBY[/i], [i]FRLG[/i], [i]SM[/i], and [i]LGPE[/i], so various posts depicting Red are expected to have different media tags. Many game characters also have different designs when they appear in remakes.\r\n* In the vast majority of cases, don't use game tags for Pokémon species.\r\n** Ex.: Posts depicting a Squirtle should not be tagged [[pokemon_rgby]] (unless there are human characters from that game in the post as well). All the same, posts depicting a [[Wooloo]] should not be tagged [[pokemon_swsh]].\r\n* As an exception, [[official art]] posts depicting a Pokémon may use game tags.\r\n** Ex.: Official art of Charizard from FRLG may be tagged [[pokemon_frlg]]. Official art of Wooloo from SwSh may be tagged [[pokemon_swsh]].\r\n\r\nA post depicting a Pokémon species is not necessarily a visible reference to any game in particular.\r\n\r\nFor instance, adding [[pokemon_swsh]] to a Wooloo post (post #3528342) would be a mistake, because Wooloo is expected to appear in other media as well.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: topic #15030.\r\n\r\nSee [[List of Pokemon media|List of Pokémon media]] for all forms of media.\r\n\r\nh4. Prototype Pokémon\r\n\r\nPrototype Pokémon are the unused Pokémon designs and creatures. They sometimes appear in fan art.\r\n\r\n* All prototype Pokémon have their own tags and don't use normal Pokémon tags. Examples:\r\n** post #3360231 - the correct tag is [[girafarig_(prototype)]], not [[girafarig]].\r\n** post #3355587 - the correct tag is [[gyarados_(prototype)]], not [[gyarados]].\r\n** post #3148107 - the correct tag is [[rai_(raikou)]], not [[raikou]].\r\n** post #3148591 - the correct tag is [[leafy_(leafeon)]], not [[leafeon]].\r\n* Prototype versions having the same names as normal Pokémon have the (prototype) qualifier.\r\n** Ex.: [[igglybuff_(prototype)]] (to distinguish from the normal [[igglybuff]]), [[gyarados_(prototype)]], [[pichu_(prototype)]], [[girafarig_(prototype)]], etc.\r\n* Whenever possible, use a name found in official sources (which are usually in Japanese).\r\n** Ex.: Some prototype Pokémon have been found, with their respective names, in the [i]Gold[/i]/[i]Silver[/i] from Space World 1997: Hanamogura, Honooguma, Volbear, Dynabear, etc.\r\n* Don't use fan translations as tags. Stick to the \"official\" Japanese names as said above. (sometimes fanart and fan sites use fan translations, but please ignore them) Feel free to mention major fan translations in the wiki pages (such as those by The Cutting Room Floor).\r\n** Ex.: The website The Cutting Room Floor translated the Pokémon names from Space World 1997: Koonya (original) became Meowsy (fan translation), Haneko (original) became Lefmew (fan translation), etc.\r\n* A prototype Pokémon is often found in a single game and is unlikely to appear in other games and media such as anime and manga, so it may use the normal game tag, as well as the prototype game tag.\r\n** Ex.: All posts depicting [[pichu_(prototype)]] should be tagged [[pokemon_gsc]], as well as [[pokemon_gsc_(prototype)]].\r\n\r\nLists of prototype Pokémon:\r\n* [[pokemon_rgby_(prototype)]]\r\n* [[pokemon_gsc_(prototype)]]\r\n* [[pokemon_rse_(prototype)]]\r\n* [[pokemon_dppt_(prototype)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231853,"created_at":"2025-03-16T10:46:45.769-04:00","updated_at":"2025-06-04T06:12:32.241-04:00","title":"by_the_beat","body":"[[Nijisanji EN]]'s eleventh wave/group.

An orphan with no knowledge of his true identity, Spartan is secretly guided by Ares, who has promised him aid during the conflict, and information as to his identity after it. In return, Spartan must help Ares achieve an unspecified revenge on someone.\r\n\r\nTotal Warrior is the only installment in the Total War series to have been released for video game consoles rather than PCs or Macs. It was the first Total War game published by Sega. The game originated in an examination of whether or not it would be possible to make a \"true\" Total War game work on a console.

The ratings are as follows:\r\n\r\n[b]PEGI 3:[/b] The content of games with a PEGI 3 rating is considered suitable for all age groups. The game should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. No bad language should be heard.\r\n\r\n[b]PEGI 7:[/b] Game content with scenes or sounds that can possibly be frightening to younger children should fall in this category. Very mild forms of violence (implied, non-detailed, or non-realistic violence) are acceptable for a game with a PEGI 7 rating.\r\n\r\n[b]PEGI 12:[/b] Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild.\r\n\r\n[b]PEGI 16:[/b] This rating is applied once the depiction of violence (or sexual activity) reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life. The use of bad language in games with a PEGI 16 rating can be more extreme, while the use of tobacco, alcohol or illegal drugs can also be present.\r\n\r\n[b]PEGI 18:[/b] The 18 rating, which indicates content suitable only for adults, is applied when the level of violence reaches a stage where it becomes a depiction of gross violence, apparently motiveless killing, or violence towards defenceless characters. The glamorisation of the use of illegal drugs, explicit sexual activity, and gambling should also fall into this age category.\r\n\r\nh4.

It should not be confused with the quite different Stetson hat type with a different brim and crease, commonly known as the cowboy hat, and which is more commonly meant by the term \"Stetson\" today. The campaign hat also should not be confused with a slouch hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral U.S. state police services (for example, the Utah Highway Patrol), and federal agencies (for example, the United States Border Patrol) wear campaign hats. These state troopers are responsible for state and interstate highway safety, and in this capacity are variously referred to in different states as State Police, Highway Patrol, State Patrol, and State Highway Patrol. So common is use of the campaign hat among state highway police that they are sometimes referred to as \"smokey bears\" or \"smokeys,\" after Smokey Bear the famous logo-character of the U.S. Forest Service. The only State Police agencies that do not employ the “smokey bear hat”, are the New York State Police, Connecticut State Police, New Jersey State Police, Texas Highway Patrol, Maryland State Police, New Mexico State Police, and the Michigan State Police. There is no direct association between the cartoon bear and the Highway Patrol; they both derive their hat styles ultimately from the U.S. Cavalry.\r\n\r\nMany other [[police]] agencies, including numerous county [[sheriff (contemporary)|]]s' services including the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], use campaign hats. Some local police use it for particular duties or divisions; for example, officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s and [[Chicago Police Department]]'s mounted units employ the hat, and deputy sheriffs assigned as cadre of the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp wear campaign hats.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":77398,"created_at":"2016-07-09T12:13:16.728-04:00","updated_at":"2025-06-02T14:45:38.575-04:00","title":"sneasel","body":"[[pokemon_(creature)|Pokémon]] #0215 in the National Pokédex, an Ice/Dark-type.\r\n\r\nEvolves into [[Weavile]].\r\n\r\nJapanese name: [b]Nyula[/b]\r\n\r\nh4.
