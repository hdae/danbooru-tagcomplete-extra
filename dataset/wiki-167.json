First published in January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by and created to compete with the already established [[Buck Rogers]] adventure strip.\r\n\r\nThe comic strip follows the adventures of [[Flash Gordon]] and his companions [[Dale Arden]] and [[Dr. Hans Zarkov]] in an alien planet called Mongo and their fight against [[Ming the Merciless]], Mongo's evil ruler.\r\n\r\nThe Flash Gordon comic series has been translated into a wide variety of media, including motion pictures, television and animated series in several different countries across the world and during many decades. \r\n\r\nFlash Gordon was featured in three vintage serial films starring American actor Buster Crabbe: \"Flash Gordon\" (1936), \"Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars\" (1938), and \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" (1940). The first Flash Gordon serial remains copyrighted, but the compilation made of the second serial, and the third serial itself are in the public domain.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 a \"campy styled\" Flash Gordon film was produced to critical acclaim. It stars former Playgirl-centerfold Sam J. Jones in the title role. Its plot is based loosely on the first few years of the comic strip (in particular the famous Alex Raymond Sunday page, \"Flight of the Hawkmen\") revising Flash's backstory by making him the quarterback of the New York Jets instead of a polo player. \r\n\r\nRaymond's drawings feature heavily in the opening credits of the 1980 film, as does the signature theme-song [b]\"Flash!\"[/b] by rock band [[queen_(band)|Queen]], who composed and performed the entire musical score.\r\n\r\nThe latest version, a Flash Gordon television series, appeared on the United States Syfy in 2007–2008.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フラッシュ・ゴードン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":91280,"created_at":"2017-10-20T16:50:46.957-04:00","updated_at":"2017-10-20T16:50:46.957-04:00","title":"nagato_sakura","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["長門櫻"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":91278,"created_at":"2017-10-20T16:19:20.339-04:00","updated_at":"2017-10-20T16:22:00.885-04:00","title":"nyan-nyan_(contact)","body":"Character from [[contact_(game)|Contact]], a space dog (contrary to what his name suggests) who helps [[terry_(contact)|Terry]] at certain points of his adventure.\r\n\r\nHis name in the English versions is [b]Mochi[/b].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ニャンニャン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":91276,"created_at":"2017-10-20T15:35:20.698-04:00","updated_at":"2017-10-20T16:17:32.217-04:00","title":"terry_(contact)","body":"Main character from [[contact_(game)|Contact]].

A [b]marine corps[/b] is a force of naval infantry designed for amphibious and ship to shore air assault, often as the beginning stages of an invasion, and as a quick reactionary force to protect a country's interests overseas. It uses the mobility and logistics of a navy to be able to quickly project ground forces into a conflict. \r\n\r\nA marine corps can range from a small special operations unit, such as the Royal Marines, to an entire combined arms military branch, like the United States Marine Corps with infantry, armor, air (both fixed and rotary wing), and support such as supply, logistics, transport, and communications. \r\n\r\nMarine corps often stress combat proficiency for all members, not just in combat occupations, because in the confusion of an initial assault, the rear echelons may come under attack and a defender may try to destroy an initial beachhead by attacking their supplies being brought to shore. \r\n\r\nModern marine corps evolved from naval infantry aboard sailing vessels whose primary roles were to protect a ship from boarding, board enemy vessels, and to protect the command crew in the event of mutiny. Later, during the later half of the 19th century, imperial powers soon found a need for ground forces that could quickly react to protect their overseas interests. Therefor many marine corps grew in order to fulfill this role. \r\n\r\nAlso, during this time with the increasing power and range of naval guns, boarding become a less common naval tactic to use in war, and the end of impressment (conscription) to crew ships meant a reduced the risk of mutiny. Marine corps evolved so that their primary mission now was amphibious assault and protection of overseas interests.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["海兵隊"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":90492,"created_at":"2017-09-25T23:29:19.734-04:00","updated_at":"2017-09-25T23:29:19.734-04:00","title":"east_coast_canuck","body":"Real name: [b]David[/b]\r\n\r\n[[canada|Canadian]] artist.\r\n\r\n\"Deviant Art Gallery\":https://eastcoastcanuck.deviantart.com/gallery/","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":28575,"created_at":"2011-08-04T20:33:55.895-04:00","updated_at":"2017-09-25T21:24:47.745-04:00","title":"entaku_no_seito","body":"円卓の生徒 ([i]Entaku no Seito[/i]: Students of Round)\r\n\r\n[[XBox360]] Role-Playing game developed and published by \"Experience Inc.\":http://www.exp-inc.jp/web0904/ \r\n\r\nh4.Characters\r\n\r\n* [[Xth Landlight]]\r\n\r\n* [[Saul Hifield]]\r\n* [[Elthalia Arlaindtir]]\r\n* [[Rorone]]\r\n* [[Lumina K.
