The film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers. \r\n\r\nFull Metal Jacket received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for Kubrick, Herr, and Hasford. In 2001, the American Film Institute placed it at No. 95 in their \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills\" poll.\r\n\r\nh4.External links:\r\n* \"Wikipedia\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket\r\n* \"IMDB\":https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フルメタルジャケット"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":107338,"created_at":"2019-07-24T17:12:56.803-04:00","updated_at":"2019-07-24T17:18:21.468-04:00","title":"white_ensign","body":"The ensign used by ships of the [[royal_navy|Royal Navy]].
