Recognition features include an inverted \"gull wing\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull_wing, fixed landing gear with wheel fairings, three-bladed [[propeller]] and undernose air intake, braced tailplanes, and long 'greenhouse' canopy topped by a radio antenna. \r\n\r\nThe [b]Junkers Ju-87 \"Stuka\"[/b] was crewed by a pilot and gunner/radio operator. Armament included 2 forward-firing [[machine gun|machine guns]] for the pilot and a single 7.92mm machine gun for the gunner. The Stuka could also carry various bomb loads underwing or a pair of podded tank-busting [[cannon]]. It also carried sirens (called \"Jericho Trumpets\") on its landing gear to serve as psychological warfare weapons, although those were later removed in later variants because they helped enemy pilots to detect and identify the planes.\r\n\r\nh4.

The plane is also a maintenance nightmare, due to the fact that its Jumo 002 engines have very limited lifespan of 21 hours of usage and causing a strain on Germany's lack of supply. Furthermore, contary to popular belief, the Allied powers have also deployed their jet aircraft into the European theatre (most notably [[P-80 Shooting Star]] and [[Gloster Meteor]]) during the early 1944, which means that the plane will not affect the course of the war regardless of how early it was deployed.\r\n\r\nh4.See Also\r\n* [[Ki-201 karyuu]]\r\n* [[kikka (airplane)]]\r\n* [[list of airplanes]]\r\n\r\nh4.External Links\r\n* \"Wikipedia: Messerschmitt Me 262\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Me262"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":18318,"created_at":"2010-05-02T19:05:25.331-04:00","updated_at":"2023-02-13T05:01:37.963-05:00","title":"p-38_lightning","body":"American [[World War II]] twin-engined piston fighter.

The original game was a beat 'em up [[video game]] conceived by \"Kishimoto Yoshihisa\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihisa_Kishimoto (creator of the [[Kunio-kun series]]) and developed by \"Technōs Japan\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techn%C5%8Ds_Japan . It was distributed in North America and Europe by [[Taito]] Corporation. \r\n\r\nThe game was a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, [[Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun]] (released outside of Japan by Taito as [i]Renegade[/i]), but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.\r\n\r\nHome versions of the game were released for the [[NES]], [[Sega Master System]], Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Game Boy, [[Sega Mega Drive]]/Sega Genesis and Atari Lynx, among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A remake titled Double Dragon Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The NES version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on April 28, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. Nintendo also released the Game Boy version on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2011.\r\n\r\nAnother remake was released for the iOS mobile devices in 2011, which features brand new gameplay, sprites, animations and music. \r\n\r\nSeveral sequels of the original game have been produced during the years for the arcade and different home consoles. A competitive fighting version was produced for the [[Neo Geo]] game console during the 90s.\r\n\r\nA new Double Dragon title, [[Double Dragon Neon]], was released in 2012 for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and is considered a reboot of the series.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary, Arc System Works released Double Dragon IV in 2017. It takes place shortly after Double Dragon II and uses an 8-bit artstyle.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[Jimmy Lee]]\r\n* [[Billy Lee]]\r\n* [[Marian Kelly]]\r\n\r\nh4.

The Ethiopian Red Terror was a period of great political upheaval in Ethiopia that started when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party known as EHAPA (by its Ethiopian acronym) ignored the invitation by Derg to join the union of socialist parties and instead made an assassination attempt on Mengistu Haile Mariam (the Chairman of Derg) in September 1976. That assassination attempt failed but it was followed by death of many Dergue supporters and ordinary citizens. \r\nThe Red Terror was a fight for power and dominance between ERRP and MESON (from its Amharic acronym). The killings from both sides were brutal since it happened when the country was under the threat of Somalian invasion and war.
