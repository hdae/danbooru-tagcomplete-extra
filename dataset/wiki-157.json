He has nicknames for the rest of Masamune's blades, calling Tsurumaru \"Tsuru-san\" and Ookurikara \"Kara-chan\".\r\n\r\nHe has a generally friendly personality, and is seen as the heart of the Masamune group due to his compassion. When he interacts with [[Sayo Samonji]] or [[Taikogane Sadamune]], he takes on a more brotherly or [[fatherly]] disposition. He also seems to enjoy cooking (a reference to his former master Date Masamune, who also liked to cook), since he's able to actively help out his new masters.  For this reason, some artists portray him as a secondary butler like [[Heshikiri Hasebe]].\r\n\r\n\r\nFans have given him the nickname \"Candle-Cutter [[Pikachu]]\" (CCP), based on an alternate reading of the kanji for Mitsutada.\r\n\r\nAppears in [i][[Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru]][/i] as a recurring side character.\r\n\r\nVoiced by Satou Takuya.

Artists at the time took advantage of that and added \"subliminal\" images in their art as a bonus for those that use such browsers.\r\n\r\nh6. Explanation of how it works\r\n\r\nThe trick works because those legacy versions of Internet Explorer highlight images using a non-transparent grid pattern, which cancels out one of the two images that have been interleaved into one image using the grid pattern. It dosn't work in modern browsers because they tint images, rather than using the grid method.\r\n\r\nBasically, the grid method works like this. Two images are put together like so:\r\n\r\n121212121\r\n212121212\r\n121212121\r\n212121212\r\n\r\nWhen highlighted, the \"1\" image is masked by the highlight, thus this is the result:\r\n\r\n#2#2#2#2#\r\n2#2#2#2#2\r\n#2#2#2#2#\r\n2#2#2#2#2\r\n#2#2#2#2#\r\n\r\nand the second image can then be plainly seen.\r\n\r\nh6. Viewing hidden images without legacy versions of Internet Explorer\r\n\r\nHere is a method of revealing the hidden image using a layer-based image editor like Photoshop or GIMP:\r\n\r\n* Open the image.\r\n* Create a new black or white layer above the original image. On this new layer, attach a [i]layer mask[/i].\r\n* Render a 1-pixel black and white checkerboard pattern as the layer mask. This effectively creates an opaque solid color layer where every other pixel is transparent.\r\n* Nudge the checkerboard layer one pixel at a time to switch between images.\r\n\r\nConsult the documentation or Google instructions on how to use layer masks and render checkerboards in your image editor.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120467,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:12:26.571-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:12:26.571-05:00","title":"paradise_(visual_novel)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Paradise(BLゲーム)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120465,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:10:20.529-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:10:20.529-05:00","title":"megachu!","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["めがちゅ!"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120462,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:05:08.076-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:05:08.076-05:00","title":"lamento","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Lamento"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120460,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:01:40.108-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:01:40.108-05:00","title":"galtia","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガルティア","GALTIA"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120458,"created_at":"2021-01-30T14:59:05.603-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:59:05.603-05:00","title":"swan_song","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SWANSONG"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":8005,"created_at":"2008-08-05T22:29:55.319-04:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:57:01.732-05:00","title":"soshite_ashita_no_sekai_yori","body":"See \"Etude  Product Page\":http://www.etude-soft.jp/product/asuseka/index.html","is_locked":false,"other_names":["そして明日の世界より―"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":18436,"created_at":"2010-05-07T02:19:48.221-04:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:07:50.871-05:00","title":"figu@mate","body":"An adult game released by Escu:de in 2006.\r\n\r\nFandisc: [[Figu@Carnival]]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.escude.co.jp/product/figu/index.html\r\nhttp://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=275905","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ふぃぎゅ@メイト"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120457,"created_at":"2021-01-30T14:07:33.707-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:07:33.707-05:00","title":"endou_ifrina","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["炎道イフリナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":17868,"created_at":"2010-04-16T14:03:45.545-04:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T12:26:04.135-05:00","title":"silent_sinner_in_blue","body":"東方儚月抄 (\"Touhou Bougetsushou\") ~ Silent Sinner in Blue\r\n\r\nAn official [[Touhou]] manga written by [[ZUN (artist)|]], with art by [[Aki Eda]].\r\n\r\nh4.
