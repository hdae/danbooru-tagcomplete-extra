The technique is a type of lateral vascular restraint that constricts the blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain.\r\n\r\nIn professional wrestling, it is used by several wrestlers, such as [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestlers [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] and Kyle O'Reilly, and [[WWE]] wrestler Pete Dunne/Butch. [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] mixed martial artist Nate Diaz infamously won a match using the triangle choke, where he insulted his opponent by showing [[middle finger|middle fingers]] and [[flexing]] his muscles while locking the hold.

The choke involves using the arms to encircle the opponent's neck in a fashion similar to the [[guillotine]], an [[execution]] apparatus.\r\n\r\nLike a rear naked choke, body scissors can be optionally applied while cinching the guillotine choke to further restrain the opponent's movement.\r\n\r\nIn professional wrestling, the term \"guillotine choke\" is used if the wrestler performing the hold also applies a body scissors. Without the body scissors, it will be called as a \"front chancery\" instead. The guillotine choke is used by various wrestlers, such as [[WWE]] wrestler [[Roman Reigns]], WWE alumni and current [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestlers [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] and Kyle O'Reilly, and [i]Ring of Honor[/i] alumnus Jimmy Jacobs.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フロントチョーク","ギロチンチョーク"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":86498,"created_at":"2017-05-15T09:28:17.353-04:00","updated_at":"2022-11-23T00:45:30.635-05:00","title":"crossface_chickenwing","body":"A [[submission hold]] made famous by [[WWE]] Hall of Famer Bob Backlund and currently used by WWE wrestler [[Asuka (Wrestler)|Asuka]] (which she calls the Asuka Lock), [[All Elite Wrestling]] wrestler Frankie Kazarian, and indie wrestler Marty Scurll.\r\n\r\nTo execute this move, the wrestler first performs the chickenwing to one of the opponent's arms. He then takes his other arms, wraps it around the opponent's neck, and then either pulls the wrestler's head to the side which puts pressure on the neck and shoulders or leaves the arm tucked under the chin as in a one-armed [[sleeper hold]]. Depending on the wrestler's preference, he may clasp his hands together to secure the hold.
