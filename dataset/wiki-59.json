The company was headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo, before moving to Mitaka, Tokyo.\r\n\r\nThe studio was formed in the early 1980s as [[Daicon]] Film by university students [[Anno Hideaki]], [[Sadamoto Yoshiyuki]], Yamaga Hiroyuki, [[Akai Takami]], Okada Toshio, Takeda Yasuhiro, and [[Higuchi Shinji]]. Their first project was to make an animated short for the 20th Annual Japan National SF Convention, also known as [[Daicon III]], held in 1981 in Osaka, Japan. The group made a much bigger splash at the 22nd Annual Japan National SF Convention, [[Daicon IV]], in 1983.\r\n\r\nThe Daicon IV short firmly established Daicon Film as a talented new anime studio. The studio changed its name to Gainax in 1985, basing the term 'Gainax' on an obscure Tottori Prefecture term for 'giant' and the English suffix 'x'.\r\n\r\nSince Gainax originated as a group of fans, it was known for maintaining ties to the general [[otaku]] community, allowing doujinshi of its work, fan-made action figures, and promoting series like Evangelion at private festivals and so on.\r\n\r\nUntil Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gainax typically worked on stories created in-house, but the studio increasingly developed anime adaptations of existing manga like [[Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou]] and [[Mahoromatic]].\r\n\r\nThe Animage Anime Grand Prix has been awarded to Gainax for Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water in 1991, Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995 and 1996, and [[The End of Evangelion]] in 1997.\r\n\r\nMuch of Gainax's former staff and series left Gainax starting in the late 2000s; notably Anno Hideaki formed [[Studio Khara]] and obtained the rights to Evangelion, several staff members (including those involved in [[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]) left to make [[Trigger (company)|Studio Trigger]], and Gainax sold their rights to FLCL to I.G. Production. [[gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]] is also made of former Gainax staff, having left in the early 90s.\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 2024, Gainax filed for bankruptcy with the Tokyo District Court, which was publicly announced over one week later on June 7. The remainder of its properties were split between the various Gainax splinter companies and former staff previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* pool #20604\r\n\r\nh4.

This plus the black neck, white streak leading from the red crown partially down the neck, and white body make them easy to identify. This crane is one of the largest crane species.\r\n\r\nOverall, they are snow white with black secondary flight feathers (in flight, these are the row of largest feathers present on the \"lower arm\" of the wing). This can appear like a fluffy black tail when the birds are standing, but the real tail feathers as well as the primary flight feathers are actually white. The bill is olive green to greenish horn, the legs are slate to grayish black.\r\n\r\nMales are black on the cheeks, throat, and neck, while females are pearly gray in these spots. \r\n\r\nSome artistic renditions may show a black tail or black primary flight feathers if the artist did not reference a photo or accurate illustration of the bird in flight. Regardless, if the crane has a red forehead or a line delineating this marking, it is almost certainly a red-crowned crane.\r\n\r\nIn Taoism this crane is a symbol of longevity and immortality. It also symbolizes luck and fidelity.\r\n\r\nh4.
