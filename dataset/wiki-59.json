All of these adaptations have story elements that add or diverge from the original arcade game, and could thus be considered their own separate timelines to some extent, similarly to its relation to the Xenoverse series.\r\n\r\nDragon Ball Heroes would largely be confined to Japanese shores, but from July to October of 2018, the arcade game was shown in 7 North American towns as part of an American tour, marking its first appearance overseas.

However, unlike [[Kantai Collection]], where most of the ships originally came from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], Warship Girls R from the start featured ships from various naval forces around the world. \r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe game was initially released by \"Suzhou Paiqu Network Technology\":[http://www.p7game.com/], as Warship Girls, for Android and iOS devices in September, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn July 2015 there was a split between the publisher of the game and its developer, MoeFantasy (幻萌), and from then on each company developed and released its own version of the game, which differed in available characters, interface design, etc.\r\n\r\nOn August 29th 2015 at ComiCon16, Shanghai, MoeFantasy revealed via trailer the development of [i]Project R[/i], a major overhaul of the game including new features, updated UI and a new animated combat system. This version was released in November the same year as client version 2.0 and was dubbed 战舰少女R (Warship Girls R). The MoeFantasy version would become the main focus of all community efforts, from wikis to drop data libraries and fan works.\r\n\r\nOn June 23rd 2016, it was announced on the community's Baidu forum and later as official statements that a settlement had been reached between the two companies. SPNT shut down its servers on September in the same year.\r\n\r\nOn October 24th 2017, a Japanese translated version and server released under the name 戦艦少女R, or Senkan Shoujo R.\r\n\r\nOn December 18th 2018, a Global server and Korean server were officially released.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2018, on September 8th, a spinoff was released that was made by MoeFantasy's Japanese branch, entitled 蒼青のミラージュ or [[steelblue mirage|MiST: The Mirage of Steelblue]]. Due to various reasons, it became unavailable on March 15th, 2020, with refunds beginning at the same time, ending on June 15th.\r\n\r\nThe Global server and Korean server were shut down on the 31st of August, 2021.\r\n\r\nh4.

The word jūji is also found in \"jūjika\" (十字架), meaning a cross.\r\n \r\nIn general, the practitioner secures an arm at the wrist of the opponent, trapping it by squeezing the knees together.

By holding the opponent's wrist to the attacker's chest with the pinky finger on the sternum and the thumb facing up (arm semi-supinated or semi-pronated), the practitioner can easily extend the opponent's arm and hyperextend the opponent's elbow.

He chose not to interfere in his master's conflict with ancient humans even after it resulted in the splitting of the Omnipotent into two conflicting and opposed sides; the god of the skies and the god of the stars. The sky god wished to recreate the sky realm while the Astral god opted to leave and create an entirely new world based on the one they had left, neither paying attention to the fate of the Speaker. Still, he continued to await contact from his master so he might continue fulfilling his role as Speaker. For thousands of years he took on the role of observer, watching over the two realms as they changed and evolved, acting only to deal with threats outwith the gods' powers.\r\n\r\nSensing an upcoming calamity that could befall the sky realm and wishing to protect the world his master created and its inhabitants, he decided to join the Singularity, the only known living human with the power to alter course of fate itself, assuming a new name to hide his true identity as a god's servant - Lucio.\r\n\r\nIn time the predicted calamity was revealed to have been set in motion by [[lucilius_(granblue_fantasy)|Lucilius]], who wished to bring an end to the entire sky realm. Initially Lucio tried to convince Lucilius to abandon his plan and his rebellion against gods, hoping to reach some common understanding as Lucilius was an Astral created in Lucio's image. But negotiations failed and Lucio was forced to feign being defeated by Lucilius, waiting inside the latter's core for the right moment to trap Lucilius in a space between dimensions which would serve as an eternal prison.\r\n\r\nAfter the calamity was halted and the visible threat was dealt with, he started to wonder if he still needed to perform his duties and if his master's wishes could really be good for this world. After all, it was not only the power of Supreme Primarch that saved the world but the combined strength of many different forces. He started to wonder if perhaps the world's current state was already perfect and no longer in need of evolution thanks to living creatures and their ability to support each other and compensate their own weaknesses. He confronted the Singularity with these mixed feelings in a dream. After reaffirming himself in his new stance, he left his role as observer and decided that it was fine to simply continue living on and to use his powers for the well-being of the skies. Aboard the Grandcypher alongside Singularity and their crew, he waits for the day when he can ask his master the true purpose behind himself, the world, and all living beings.
