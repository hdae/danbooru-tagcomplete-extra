The development of the first G.I. Joe toy led to the coining of the term \"action figure\". G.I. Joe's appeal to children has made it an American icon among toys. The action figure line has also become famous in many different countries across the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe G.I. Joe trademark has been used by Hasbro to title two different toy lines. \r\n\r\nThe original 12-inch (30 cm) line that began in 1964 centered on realistic action figures. In the United Kingdom, this line was licensed to Palitoy and known as [i]Action Man[/i]. \r\n\r\nThe initial product offering represented four of the branches of the U.S. armed forces with the Action Soldier (U.S. Army), Action Sailor (U.S. Navy), Action Pilot (USAF), Action Marine (USMC) and later on, the Action Nurse. \r\n\r\nThen in 1982, the line was relaunched in a much smaller 3.75-inch (9.5 cm) scale complete with new futuristic vehicles, detailed playsets, and a complex and rich background story involving an ongoing struggle between the [i]G.I. Joe [/i] team and the evil [[Cobra Command]] organization which seeks to take over the Free World through [[terrorism]] and using advanced and sophisticated weaponry. \r\n\r\nThe new 80s line was initially intended as a means to sell the new toy vehicles, but over time the unique characters and their different and detailed action figures became much more popular and extremely sought after to this day.\r\n\r\nThe 1982 toy line became extremely successful and was also supported by two animated series as well as a major [[comic]] series published initially by [[Marvel]] Comics which expanded each character's background and mythos which were mostly developed by Marvel writer/artist \"Larry Hama\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hama .\r\n\r\nh4.

The Japanese title is often shortened to パズドラ ([i]Pazudora[/i]), while the English title is often shortened to PAD.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay consists of the player going through dungeons (there are regular dungeons, special dungeons, and technical dungeons) and battling monsters and bosses via matching element tiles to attack and/or heal in order to earn various in-game currencies. Beating dungeons eventually gives enough experience points to allow the player to level up so their rank, stamina, team cost, and monster box capacity may increase. Another factor of gameplay is the player collecting, fusing, and evolving their monsters in order to make them stronger. Utilizing monster abilities and stats is vital to the gameplay, especially later on in the game.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 1400 and counting unique monsters that can be collected by the player. These range from traditional [[dragon|dragons]], [[demon|demons]], [[ogre|ogres]], [[goblin|goblins]], and [[knight|knights]] to mythological figures from various real world cultures and religions, fictionalized versions of popular historical figures, and even third party fictional characters.\r\n\r\n[[crossover|The game also does various collaborations with several anime and video game properties]] which are usually Japanese only.

Voters were allowed to cast a single vote for their favorite Call. The poll ran from September 27 to October 1, 2013, the end of the Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter. The top three vote getters would then move onto a second round.\r\n\r\nThe vote results were announced during a livestream \"here\":http://www.twitch.tv/comceptusa/c/3019760 at around 2:15:00. \r\n\r\nThe results were also recapped in the Kickstarter post \"here\":https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyno9/mighty-no-9/posts/615035. Of the over 82,000 votes, the finalists had the following vote shares:\r\n\r\n* Call H - 10.12%\r\n* Call E - 24.09% \r\n* Call F - 35.31%\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter announcing the results during the livestream, they also talked about other Call designs. This included Inafune's Call D. \r\n* (At 2:20:50) Host: One thing that a lot of people pointed out was this hairstyle looks like a certain bad, other villain from a previous game series and might have had a bad association with some people.\r\n* (Translator conveying this to Inafune)\r\n* Inafune: (laughs) Dr. Wilyという！\r\n* Another Translator (Mighty No. 069):  He's saying, \"Just shut up and say 'Dr. Wily'!\"\r\n* Host: I was trying to be tactful about it.\r\n* Mighty No. 069: \"Shut up and say, 'Dr. Wily!'\"\r\n* Host: Was that on purpose or was that...\r\n* Inafune: Dr. Wilyを出さないじゃん。Dr. Wilyを出すべきだと思って、あの、一応silhouetteになった、Dr. Wilyになるから\r\n* Mighty No. 069: So, ultimately I was thinking that, you know, there was no Dr. Wily in the game, but there should be somebody that carries the torch, that carries on the torch for Dr. Wily, so, you know, I figured that I couldn't really use Dr. Wily. However, the silhouette looks somewhat similar so that's kind of a way to...\r\n* Inafune: <some Japanese>\r\n* Mighty No. 069: So probably the high-level people, the high-level people with true art taste, would be able to look at this and know that this truly is the best design. The other people probably just chose F, the ones that didn't know. He's joking folks, he's joking.\r\n \r\nh6. Second round\r\n\r\nIn the second round, voting was restricted to online backers.

Super battle droids were much stronger than their predecessors, and like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies.
