It aired weekly from April 15, 1984 until September 30, 1984.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Cross followed [[Choujikuu Yousai Macross|The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]] (1982-1983) created by Studio Nue with Artland and produced by Tatsunoko, and [[Choujikuu Seiki Orguss|The Super Dimension Century Orguss]] (1983-1984), also created by Studio Nue with Artland and produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha.\r\n\r\nThe three titles share some of the same creators and staff, and [[MACROSS]] is referenced by character cameos and inside references by the latter two series. However, the basic stories are unrelated. Southern Cross was the least successful of the 'Super Dimensional' banner and was actually canceled due to low ratings, forcing the scriptwriters to hastily conclude the anime. The series lasted for 23 episodes. \r\n\r\nUnlike the other two series, The Southern Cross was created and produced almost entirely by [[tatsunoko_pro|Tatsunoko]] with mechanical designs by its sister studio Ammonite (Ogawa Hiroshi, Ohkura Hirotoshi and Ono Takashi). The characters of the show were designed by [[Kogawa Tomonori]], [[Kitazume Hiroyuki]] and Sonoda Miyo.\r\n\r\nMost of the animation of The Southern Cross (with edited content and revised dialogue) was adapted outside Japan for the second part of [[ROBOTECH]], following [b]The Macross Saga[/b], and preceding [b]The New Generation[/b]. In this form, it is frequently referred to as [b]Robotech Masters[/b] (as it was titled in the comic book adaptation released by Comico) or also [b]The Masters Saga[/b].\r\n\r\nh4.

[i][[miko|Priestesses]] of the Godless Month[/i]) is a manga series created by the duo [[Kaishaku]]. The series was serialized in fourteen chapters by [i]Kadokawa Shoten[/i] and in [i]Shounen Ace[/i] in 2004 and 2005, and collected in two bound volumes. The series was adapted as an anime television series broadcast in 12 episodes on [i]TNK[/i] between October and December 2004. A drama CD was released on November 25, 2004 by [i]Geneon[/i] based on the anime version.\r\n\r\nThe series centers on the [[yuri]] relationship of the two main characters, [[kurusugawa_himeko|Himeko]] and [[himemiya_chikane|Chikane]], with elements of [[magical girl]] and [[mecha]] themes helping to carry the plot. An anime series that includes several characters similar to those of [i]Kannazuki no Miko[/i] called [i][[Kyoushirou to Towa no Sora]][/i] aired in Japan between January and March 2007.\r\n\r\nBecause it was one of the first yuri romances in an anime that was played as a straight romance, it's become iconic for yuri romance, especially its ED artwork, featuring the memetic [[miko embrace]].  (The pose is essentially synonymous with yuri.)\r\n\r\nThe manga and anime were originally released in English under the original Japanese title by Tokyopop and Geneon USA respectively. After Geneon USA's shutdown, distribution rights for the anime were transferred to Sentai Filmworks, who now distribute the series under the English title [b]Destiny of the Shrine Maiden[/b].\r\n\r\nh4.

As a keystone species it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating prey populations.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats.

What can be said with certainty is that this story had spread long before it was popularized on the internet and worldwide web.\r\n\r\nA parallel episode is a story about when \"Futabatei Shimei\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futabatei_Shimei translated \"Turgenev's\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Turgenev \"Asya\", and translated the eponymous heroine's \"I love you\" as \"I wouldn't mind if I die.

It was written on \"the blog\":http://lab.flama.co.jp/archives/398/ of \"an IT engineer\":http://lab.flama.co.jp/ in 2011, and while he did find a place in Shimei's translation that says \"I wouldn't mind if I die.\", the corresponding line in the original Russian version says, \"Ваша…\" (\"[I am] yours...\")\r\nSince it was Shimei who gave this novella the Japanese title of \"Unrequited Love (片戀/片恋)\", his superb sensibilities and policy as a translator have made this legend more persuasive.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her name is officially rendered as [i]Nevada [/i](ネヴァダ), although this has been historically interchanged with the spelling [i]Nebada[/i] (ネバダ), especially in the case of the historical battleship and her namesake state.\r\n\r\nNevada has three forms. Her base level mimicks her status when she was first built, her Kai level shows Nevada how she was during the Attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], and her Kai Mod. 2 level shows Nevada's post-attack wartime refit. Nevada's clothing, hairstyle, and even eye color all change depending on her remodel level, but all three show Nevada with long [[red hair]] and wearing a [[sleeveless]], white [[collared shirt]], a greyish-brown dress, [[white gloves]], [[black belt]], and boots. \r\n\r\nAt her base level, Nevada has [[red eyes]] and braided hair, a [[red neckerchief]], [[grey boots]], [[thigh strap]], and [[grey jacket]] with a white fringe-trimmed collar. Her [[rigging]] is entirely light grey color, with a distinctive large cage mast behind Nevada's head. Her damaged art shows she wears [[white bloomers]].\r\n\r\nAt Kai, Nevada now has a red-lined [[blue jacket]] with a black collar, [[red thighhighs]], and the bottom of her dress now has [[fringe trim]] while her collar does not anymore. Her rigging is now colored greyish-blue, her mast forms a tripod shape behind her head, and Nevada has a catapult \"gun\" carried in her right hand. \r\n\r\nAt Kai Mod. 2, Nevada's eyes change to red and blue [[multicolored eyes]], her hair comes out of its braid but gains a metal [[hairband]], and her outfit loses any fringe trim. She now wears [[blue boots]] with a grey top, her jacket drops the red trim but gains a grey back, and she trades the red neckerchief for a [[red necktie]]. Her rigging includes extra [[anti-aircraft gun]]s attached to her hip via a sling, a large radar added to her tripod mast, and changes color again to be red/blue/grey in layers. Her damaged art also reveals that Nevada has also changed to [[black panties]].\r\n\r\nLike [[Fletcher (Kancolle)|]], Nevada's three levels of upgrades result in all her seasonal outfits coming in three variants, depending on which remodel stage Nevada is at. \r\n\r\nh4.

June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who was the 45th and 47th President of the [[united states|United States of America]]. \r\n\r\nBorn into a wealthy family in the New York City borough of Queens, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show [i]The Apprentice[/i], from which the catchphrase \"You're fired!\" came from, bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against the Democratic Party's nominee, [[Hillary Clinton]] and her running mate Virginian Senator [[Tim Kaine]]. His slogan during the campaign was \"[[Make America Great Again]]\".\r\n\r\nAfter losing the 2020 presidential election to [[Joe Biden]], Trump attempted to overturn the result, culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Trump was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times. \r\n\r\nOn July 13, 2024, Trump was shot in the ear in an [[2024 attempted assassination of Donald Trump|assassination attempt]] at a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania. In November 2024, he defeated incumbent vice-president [[Kamala Harris]] and Minnesota governor [[Tim Walz]] to become 47th president of the United States. His running mate was Ohio senator [[JD Vance]]. Along with [[Grover Cleveland]], Trump is one of the only two US Presidents to have served two non-consecutive terms.\r\n\r\nCommonly depicted with [[blonde hair]], a [[red necktie]], and, occasionally unbecomingly, [[orange skin]].\r\n\r\n* !post #8933759: 2025 inaugural portrait\r\n\r\nh4.
