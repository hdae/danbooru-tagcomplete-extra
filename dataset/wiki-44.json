Deciding whether to add commentary\r\n\r\nCommentaries should always be added to posts when they are available. When using the \"upload bookmarklet\":[/static/bookmarklet], commentary will automatically be fetched from supported sites. For unsupported sites, it will have to be copied over manually.\r\n\r\nh4. Adding the artist's commentary\r\n\r\nYou can add or edit information in these fields by viewing a post and then clicking the [b]Add commentary[/b] link in the sidebar. A dialog with four fields will appear. Original title and Original description should have the artist's original commentary, regardless of the language it's in. Commentary can automatically be fetched from the source link or another external link, or copied from another post altogether.\r\n\r\nAll posts with commentary should be tagged with [[commentary]] or [[commentary request]], as well as the language of the commentary, if it is not in Japanese.\r\n\r\nIf the artist has also posted any interesting tags, these can be listed at the bottom of the commentary field (e.g. post #2519177).\r\n\r\nh4. Commentaries from multiple sources\r\n\r\nOften, an artist will post a particular picture at [[multiple sources]], using a different commentary for each source. \r\n\r\nIn those cases, use the [b]h4[/b] dtext tag for source headings, [b]h5[/b] for titles, and everything goes in the body.  Additionally, use textile links on the sources pointing to the original source material for the comment ([[help:dtext]]). Using the \"Fetch\" option in the commentary form will automatically fill this out for you.\r\n\r\nSee post #2387146 for an example of this in action.\r\n\r\nh4. Translating the artist's commentary\r\n\r\nTranslations of the commentary can be placed in the Translated title and Translated description fields in the [b]Add artist commentary[/b] dialog.\r\n\r\nOnce all relevant parts of the commentary are translated into English, the [[commentary request]] tag should be removed and replaced with the [[commentary]] tag. If you are unsure of the translation, add the [[check commentary]] tag.\r\n\r\nh4. Commentary formatting\r\n\r\nSee [[help:dtext]] for help with formatting commentary. Note that DText does not work in commentary titles, only the description.\r\n\r\nSee [[howto:translate]] and [[howto:romanize]] for further policies on translations.\r\n\r\nh4.

Its principal task during its early years as a government-owned corporation was to repair and aid in the recovery of rail lines in the American Northeast and lower Great Lakes, neglected after their previous owners suffered decreasing revenue between stifling regulation and intensive competition from trucks and aircraft. Much of its early years would be spent shedding unprofitable branch lines and carrying out desperately-needed repairs on major rail arteries. The company would eventually turn a profit in the 1980s and be privatized shortly thereafter. Conrail as an independent entity would last until 1999, when it was split between the CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern. The company exists to the present day, albeit as a \"shared assets organization\" managed jointly by CSX and NS to handle freight traffic in and around the ports in the New York City area. \r\n\r\nThe company is remembered by American railfans for its particular origins, unique power (being the only railroad to order the EMD SD80MAC and having briefly run electrified operations in its early years), blue livery, and \"can opener\" logo.\r\n\r\nh4.

Originally a boy from a Romani family, he witnessed his mother's death at the hands of some demons she had summoned to fight Latverian soldiers. Swearing revenge, he began to master magic and technology. Eventually, he traveled to America to study some more, and that is where he met (and eventually became foes with) [[Reed Richards]].\r\n\r\nDue to an incident involving constructing a portal to Hell to resurrect his mother, Doom blamed Richards for the incident for causing the scars on his face. He constructed a suit of metal armor and became the cloaked tyrant scientist known today. He considers himself to be the smartest man on Earth and shows signs of politeness to his enemies. The dictator represents the sins of pride, ambition, wrath, and envy.\r\n\r\nAside the Fantastic Four, Doom has faced nearly every superhero in the Marvel Universe: [[Avengers (series)|The Avengers]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[X-Men]], to name a few.\r\n\r\nDoom appears in various Marvel-related media, such as movies, TV shows, and video games. Among one of his most famous appearances is in the [[Marvel vs. Capcom]] series of fighting games, where he is a playable character. In Japan, his [[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|1967 animated version]], known as Akuma Hakase, or Dr. Demon, is fondly remembered by older fans for being a more comedic spin on the character, speaking in [[Nagoyaben]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Dr.ドゥーム","ドクター・ドゥーム","ドクタードゥーム","ヴィクター・フォン・ドゥーム","Dr.Doom","DoctorDoom","悪魔博士"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":191915,"created_at":"2024-05-02T03:29:52.062-04:00","updated_at":"2024-08-23T21:55:27.992-04:00","title":"osomatsu_(series)","body":"Umbrella tag for the \"Osomatsu\" manga and anime series by [[Akatsuka Fujio]]\r\n\r\nh4.

In Gongshou Li, the fingers cup the fist, and in Baoquan Li, the fingers are held straight out.\r\n\r\nGongshou Li (拱手礼), also know as [i]Fist and palm salute[/i], is a formal greeting etiquette in ancient China. It is commonly used in daily occasions (meeting and parting, when offering thanks or apologies). This greeting consists of a half-fist held in the palm of the other hand at stomach level, while [[bowing]] slightly to deeply depending on how much respect they want to convey.\r\n\r\nNote that for males, the right-hand makes the fist and the left hand is on top. For females, it's the opposite. At a funeral, the greeting is done on the other way around: right-hand on top for men and left-hand on top for women.\r\n\r\nBaoquan Li (抱拳礼) also know as [i]Kung Fu Salute[/i], [i]Hold palm salute[/i] or [i]Hold fist salute[/i], is a common etiquette derived from (but not exclusive to) Chinese martial arts. It shows the humility and often widely used among the kung fu masters and students. This salute is generally characterized by an open left hand placed next to a closed right fist. The importance is that the fingers on the left hand should stay extended and not flexed to cover the right fist.\r\n\r\nh4.

She also expresses resentment towards her [i]King George V[/i]-class half-sisters, believing them inferior to her, especially [[Prince of Wales (Azur Lane)|]] (as PoW was the only one of the class sunk).\r\n\r\nAs a reference to being taken from [i]World of Warships[/i], Monarch gains an ability based off of the \"Adrenaline Rush\" skill, improving her reload as the damage she takes increases.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the only “Monarch” from the era was an [i]Iron Duke[/i]-class dreadnought. The HMS [i]Monarch[/i] seen in both games is based off of a design proposal for what would become the [i]King George V[/i]-class battleships, armed with three 381 mm triple gun mounts. British policymakers, fearing another naval arms race, called for a reduction in main battery gun caliber to 356 mm.\r\n\r\nh4.

Character designed by [[fuzichoco]], voiced by [[Endou Aya]]. \r\n\r\nFirst appeared in the game's portable console spinoff game [[Azur Lane: Crosswave]] before being made playable in the original mobile version during the Swirling Cherry Blossoms event of December 2019.\r\n\r\nShe wears a white [[military uniform]], [[bike shorts]], a [[single leg pantyhose]] on her left and a [[garter straps|garter strap]] [[single thighhigh]] on her right, and a long [[white coat]] with an [[aiguillette]] and [[epaulettes]]. The coat also has the [[Sakura Empire (emblem)|Sakura Empire insignia]] on the left side. The rank insignia of her coat means \"Vice Admiral\" in the IJN, reflective of the real-life rank held by her designer, Yuzuru Hiraga. She is also seen with a pre-1935 IJN military sword (guntou) attached to her belt on her left.\r\n\r\nHer rig contains five 41 cm twin mounts: two on her back, one on her left, two on her right. Like other IJN shipgirls, she also has an animalistic trait: [[horns]] with [[hair flower]]s on them.\r\n\r\nHistorically, her name was never finalized before she was cancelled in November 1923 to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty. Thus, she is also known in records as \"Ship Number 11\".\r\n\r\nh4.
