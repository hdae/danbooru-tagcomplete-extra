Its popularity spawned the anime [[Ragnarok the Animation]]. \r\n\r\nDue to numerous hacks that leaked the source code during the beta years of the game, semi-legal emulated private servers became the most popular way to play for non-East Asian gamers. The game's overall settings and design, particularly its class system, would go on to inspire numerous fantasy MMORPG and media.

Her namesake (and namesake of the class) is Navy Admiral \"Frank Friday Fletcher (1855-1928)\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Friday_Fletcher], who served in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably as commander of naval forces at the \"Battle of Veracruz\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Veracruz] in Mexico. She is designed by [[Zeco]], who also illustrated the first of her class in the game, [[johnston (kancolle)|Johnston]].\r\n\r\nThe Fletcher class was the most numerous of the destroyers that participated in World War II, built completely free from any treaty restrictions with a larger size, larger fuel capacity and range, and better armaments. In the world of Kantai Collection, this translates to Fletcher and Johnston being tall and having ample bustlines; among the other non-Japanese destroyers before them, only [[tashkent (kancolle)|Tashkent]] is comparable in those areas while the others are implied to have flat chests.\r\n\r\nBeing the nameship of the class, Fletcher herself is given traits of [[long hair|long]] [[blonde hair]] with triangular [[double bun|side buns]], [[purple eyes]], and a [[large breasts|very well-endowed]] body. Her outfit is similar to Johnston's but with the black features being given lighter colors: a stylized [[serafuku]] which consists of an [[off shoulder|off-shoulder]] [[blue shirt]] with a [[white sailor collar]] that exposes her [[cleavage]], a [[yellow neckerchief]], and a short [[white skirt|white]] [[pleated skirt]], along with [[white thighhighs]] that are shielded by what seem to be metallic thigh and [[shin guards]] and red [[rudder footwear|rudder shoes]]. She also wears [[white gloves|white short gloves]] and a metallic [[hairband]]. In her remodeled form, she adds a [[star hair ornament]] to each side of her hairband.\r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] consists of two [[smokestack]]s and two 5-inch [[cannon]] [[ship turret]]s with one set on each side of her rigging. Her hull number is emblazoned on each side of her lower rigs. She also carries a [[cargo net]], a reference to her rescuing many survivors of the USS [i][[Northampton (kancolle)|]][/i] during the \"Battle of Tassafaronga\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tassafaronga] by using cork-floated cargo nets.\r\n\r\nOn her [[Fletcher Kai (kancolle)|Kai remodel]], Fletcher gains a silver [[star hair ornament]] on each side of her hairband, and her rigging gains an additional radar set atop the director and loses its blue camoflage in favor of standard grey color.\r\n\r\nFletcher is the first non-Japanese destroyer in the game to get a second remodel, and winds up with [i]two[/i] [[Fletcher Mk II (kancolle)|reversible modes]]. In both of them, she loses the cargo net and gains a pair of [[headphones]]. One of the modes gives her a quintuple torpedo launcher to carry, while the other completely redoes her rigging, giving her experimental ASW equipment to carry, making her headband more angular (mimicking the changed shape of her bridge), and changing the color of her skirt and thighhighs from white to black.\r\n\r\nh4.

Porter was a Fletcher-class destroyer serving in the US Navy during WWII. She is, infamously, the \"unluckiest ship of WWII\". \r\n\r\nHer bad luck streak began when President Roosevelt, relaxing in an easy chair upon the deck of the USS Iowa, was watching an exercise that Willie Dee was a part of and Willie Dee accidentally launched a live torpedo at the USS Iowa to which the USS Iowa only barely outmaneuvered. The sailor who accidentally fired the torpedo was thrown into the brig but Roosevelt immediately pardoned him so he could get back to his duties. \r\n\r\nWhile this particular event was only the start of her ill fortune, said ill fortune apexed dramatically at her end. A Japanese kamikaze barely missed hitting the Willie Dee during the final days of the conflict, hitting the water before colliding with the ship. The momentum of the kamikaze plane, carrying a torpedo, sent the submerged plane and its now deceased pilot directly underneath the Willie Dee, where the torpedo then activated and exploded, bifurcating her and sending her under. \r\n\r\nWillie Dee has been with Azur Lane since the game started, but only as a loading graphic and as a temporary placeholder for other ships and the only official artwork of her is in the background of image of the other Fletchers. She has (as of April 2025) yet to be released to the player as an actual ship.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ウィリアム・D・ポーター(アズールレーン)","Willy_Dee_(azur_lane)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":140880,"created_at":"2022-03-28T21:50:04.212-04:00","updated_at":"2025-05-12T10:17:05.722-04:00","title":"mash_kyrielight_(enma-tei_uniform)","body":"[[Mash Kyrielight]] in a red kimono and green hakama, with her hair being done up in a very short ponytail.

This led to Glock suing Smith & Wesson for patent infringement, which resulted in Smith & Wesson having to alter the design and pay an undisclosed settlement to Glock.\r\n\r\nh4.
