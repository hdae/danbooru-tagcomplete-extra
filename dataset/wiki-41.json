Uploading\r\n\r\nTo upload from Twitter, paste a link to the tweet on the \"upload page\":[/uploads/new], like this:\r\n\r\n* https://danbooru.donmai.us/uploads/new?url=https://twitter.com/weirdlilguys/status/1755223245614150080\r\n\r\nDon't paste a direct link to the image, like this:\r\n\r\n* https://danbooru.donmai.us/uploads/new?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFvOPQpW0AAR0A4.jpg\r\n\r\nIf you paste a direct link to the image, then Danbooru won't be able to find which tweet it belongs to, and won't be able to pull the artist, tags, and commentary.\r\n\r\nh4. Image quality\r\n\r\nSince December 11th, 2019, Twitter won't compress or downscale images unless the image is bigger than 4096x4096, more than 5MB large, or it has [[exif rotation]] or very inefficient compression (\"[1]\":[https://twitter.com/NolanOBrien/status/1204557498990002176], \"[2]\":[https://twitter.com/NolanOBrien/status/1204842518208057344]).\r\n\r\nThis means that Twitter uploads usually have the same quality as Pixiv uploads.\r\n\r\nImages posted before December 11th, 2019 were always compressed or downscaled (except for PNG with alpha channel), so Twitter images from this time period were generally lower quality than Pixiv images.\r\n\r\nh4.

The four were summoned as heroes to save the country from periodic mass appearances of monsters, an event they refer to as a \"wave.\" Each was equipped with one of four legendary weapons: Sword, Bow, Spear, and Shield.\r\n\r\nFrom the onset Naofumi as the Hero of the Shield is treated differently from the other three, with people treating him coldly, spreading rumors about him, and refusing to group with him. His situation greatly worsens and he is shunned by nearly everyone when the only person who choose to group with him falsely accuses him of raping her. Outcasted, but unable to escape his situation, he eventually is convinced to purchase a slave to make up for his lack of offensive ability. Lacking proper funds he purchases a young demi-human girl named [[Raphtalia]].

Lacking confidence for most of her life, even though she belongs to a prestigious clan, she has only recently begun to work on herself more, but is not yet willing to share it with everyone.\r\n\r\nYomi awakened to her Ninja Art after a conversation, which allowed her to break out of her shell and take on different personality types, preferring the very outgoing one. She wishes to grow more confident with that but keeps this ability and second life she made as an idol a secret.\r\n\r\nWhen using her Ninja Art, she changes herself to a more outgoing and flashy personality.\r\n\r\nh4.External links\r\n* \"Taimanin Wiki: Sumitani Yumi\":https://taimanin.fandom.com/wiki/Sumitani_Yumi\r\n* \"Default ver.\":https://taimanin-rpg.wikiru.jp/?cmd=read&page=SR%2F%E6%BE%84%E8%B0%B7%E5%A4%95%E7%BE%8E&word=%E6%BE%84%E8%B0%B7%E5%A4%95%E7%BE%8E","is_locked":false,"other_names":["澄谷夕美"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206940,"created_at":"2024-09-06T22:45:01.405-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-06T22:45:01.405-04:00","title":"xieshen_dawutai","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["邪神大舞台"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206939,"created_at":"2024-09-06T22:44:53.821-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-06T22:44:53.821-04:00","title":"huang_xiaoliu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["黄小六"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206938,"created_at":"2024-09-06T22:44:44.451-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-06T22:44:44.451-04:00","title":"cheng_yin","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["成尹"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206937,"created_at":"2024-09-06T22:35:01.669-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-06T22:35:01.669-04:00","title":"xiangsi_hongdou_hunlian_zhongxin","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["相思红豆婚恋中心"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206936,"created_at":"2024-09-06T22:34:54.189-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-06T22:34:54.189-04:00","title":"yi_wei","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["易蔚"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":206932,"created_at":"2024-09-06T21:49:58.660-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-06T22:07:22.489-04:00","title":"unbuttoned_jacket","body":"A [[jacket]] which is seen [[unbuttoned]], generally [[open jacket|open]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The M113 was sent to [[United States Army]] Europe in 1961 to replace the mechanized infantry's M59 APCs. The M113 was first used in combat in April 1962 after the United States provided the South Vietnamese Army with heavy weaponry such as the M113, under the \"MACV\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Assistance_Command,_Vietnam] program. Eventually, the M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the [[Vietnam War]] and was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the [[jungle]] to attack and overrun enemy positions. It gained the nickname as the modern \"battle taxi\". \r\n\r\nThe M113 was the first aluminum hull [[military vehicle|combat vehicle]] to be put into mass production. Much lighter than earlier similar vehicles, its aluminum armor was designed to be thick enough to protect the crew and passengers against [[under fire|small arms fire]], but light enough that the vehicle was air transportable and moderately amphibious.\r\n\r\nThe APC's versatility spawned a wide variety of adaptations that live on worldwide and in U.S. service. It is estimated that over 80,000 vehicles in the M113 family have been produced and used by over 50 countries worldwide, making it one of the most widely used [[armored vehicle]]s of all time.

The series is well known for its \"Arino's Challenge\" (有野の挑戦状, [i]Arino no Chousenjou[/i]) segments, where Arino plays through and attempts to complete retro games with the help of his Assistant Directors and various other staff members. It was briefly brought over to the West in the late 2000's as [i]Retro Game Master[/i]. [[Nintendo]] eventually released a parody of the series in 2015 on its Youtube page titled [i]Gamecenter DX[/i], which has Arino's co-star Hamaguchi Masaru as a manager playing games that haven't been released.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the series had a [[Nintendo DS]] game modeled after it: [i][[Gamecenter CX: Arino's Challenge]][/i], with a lot of the game's input coming directly from the show's staff. The game then got a sequel in 2009 and a [[Nintendo 3DS]] sequel in 2014.\r\n\r\nh4.
