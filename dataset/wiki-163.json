Unlike American light machine guns, the ammunition belt is fed from the right side using a non-disintegrating belt link. \r\n\r\nThis modernized version can be distinguished from the original [[pk_machine_gun|PK]] by a shorter flash hider; smooth barrel (the earlier one had the first half of the barrel fluted); and a ribbed top cover.\r\n\r\nThis gun is slated to be replaced by the [[PKP_Pecheneg|PKP Pecheneg]]. The best way to differentiate between the PKM and the PKP is the position of the carry handle; the Pecheneg's carry handle is right above the barrel while the PKM's carry handle protrudes above the receiver.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["PKM"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":9900,"created_at":"2009-01-19T20:36:33.969-05:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T20:27:52.553-04:00","title":"nakahira_guy","body":"Mangaka, illustrator, and doujin artist.\r\nJapanese name: 中平凱\r\nCircle name: Metamorphose","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114564,"created_at":"2020-07-05T20:14:38.423-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T20:14:38.423-04:00","title":"fukase_yoriko","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["深瀬頼子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114562,"created_at":"2020-07-05T20:08:19.287-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T20:08:19.287-04:00","title":"nakitai_watashi_wa_neko_wo_kaburu","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["泣きたい私は猫をかぶる","a_whisker_away"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":20778,"created_at":"2010-07-03T21:59:23.346-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T17:48:52.105-04:00","title":"amezawa_koma","body":"Female artist, eromangaka.\r\n\r\nName: 飴沢狛 (Amezawa Koma)\r\nCircle name: ぽんずアメ (Ponzu Ame)\r\nOld circle name: 恋もまた唄う。 (Koi mo Mata Utau.)","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114557,"created_at":"2020-07-05T13:09:34.521-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:09:34.521-04:00","title":"shimada_kai_(sangatsu_no_lion)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["島田開"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114532,"created_at":"2020-07-03T12:22:50.404-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T10:38:12.826-04:00","title":"silver_(metal)","body":"Things made out of silver, such as [[coin|coins]], [[jewelry]] or [[cutlery]].\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[gold]]\r\n* [[silver hair]] - for silver-colored hair","is_locked":false,"other_names":["銀","シルバー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114556,"created_at":"2020-07-05T03:45:27.544-04:00","updated_at":"2020-07-05T03:45:27.544-04:00","title":"yukimi_(yagi)","body":"A character created by [[yagi_(ningen)|yagi]].

It debuted in arcades in 1998 on the S-TV [[arcade]] board and sequentially saw a port to the [[Sega Saturn]]. \r\n\r\nThe game features a unique weapon system different from other shooters; instead the traditional power-up items found in other games, the eponymous Silverguns are equipped with seven different weapons that can be powered-up by using that particular weapon and effective scoring. \r\n\r\nAmong the Silverguns' arsenal is a powerful sword that can perform a devastating attack upon filling a special attack meter. It's other unique aspect was its chain scoring system where by destroying three enemies of the same color will result in a \"Chain Bonus\" that accumulates as the player chain the same-colored enemies in succession.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most sought-after Sega Saturn games around; it was never released outside Japan unfortunately, and import copies of the game can fetch around high prices at auction sites due to its rarity and legacy. Thankfully, in 2011, it saw an enhanced re-release on [[xbox_360|Xbox 360]] for 1,200 Microsoft Points ($15 U.S. Dollars) via Xbox LIVE Arcade, with optional HD graphics, English translated subtitles, and online multi-player.\r\n\r\nh4.
