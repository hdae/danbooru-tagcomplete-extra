He is believed to have come from the isolated star of Fomalhaut to this planet. The specs of the body he was born with are unusually high. However, he is extremely weak on the mental front to the point that it can eclipse his physical strong points. He can't handle complex thinking and is especially bad at numbers. Despite normally speaking with confidence, Cthugha has a surprisingly low self-esteem. It depresses him when his words come back to haunt him and cause him to physically blow up and damage his surroundings. Those who know this about him see him as someone who's dangerous when summoned, so that's why he's alone. His summoning this time has him misunderstanding and becoming an overpowered reincarnated hero from some story somewhere, and now it looks like he's attempting to turn things around in one big home run. Since he doesn't understand bantering and has burned countless followers, it appears the ex-ruler and winner at life in Aoyama is avoiding him. This relationship has not changed since their time at Old Ones, and there is no sign of making a new connection here. Cthugha has one-sided feelings of sympathy for people who appear to talk in circles but not get anywhere.\r\n\r\nh4.

A Transient from Penglai, he was once a human poet but was transformed into a tiger. Sometime after arriving in Tokyo, his fur changed into the white color it is today. He acts like a delinquent, but at his core, he is serious and responsible. However, he also has an overconfident streak that makes him overestimate his knowledge and ability, as well as a penchant for spouting old-fashioned poetry and proverbs.

This power scatters about death on the battlefield without regards to friend or foe, but by borrowing the power of another this eye can become sealed. He has been through many wars and has gained fame as a general and the proudest king of the giants. However due to a defeat from a certain point in time, all of his dignity was stripped away and his pride was broken, and in the end he became someone who waited for his death penalty to be carried out within prison. He wishes to die on the battlefield as opposed to an execution ground, so he accepted some arrangements to be used by other World Representatives. After being imprisoned in the military academy prison in Nerima, he now works as a combat instructor training death row inmates as soldiers.
