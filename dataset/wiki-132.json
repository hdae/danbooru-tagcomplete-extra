Notably Superboy and Spider-man. \r\n\r\nWhat we know about Briggs so far is that: He's been Spider-boy for 3 years, according to him. Meaning he started when he was 7. Dan Slott clarified on twitter, the creator of Spider-boy, that means that Briggs started around the Spider-man event called \"Big Time\"!\r\n\r\nHis powers seem to be similar to Peter's in that he has superior strength and the ability to stick to walls. Except that his Spider Sense seems to warn him of upcoming peril.

It's more then likely Peter might have altered the previous 616 timeline by removing Briggs from it, thinking he was saving the kid from a life of super heroics rather then dooming him to be forgotten in the new current 616 timeline. \r\n\r\nThink Spider-man in No Way Home when he had Dr. Strange erase himself from people's memories in the MCU, if that helps.  \r\nexcept it's way worse because Briggs no long has a mother, nor does anyone remember him personally along with his secret identity. \r\n\r\n* [[spider-man]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":169485,"created_at":"2023-07-27T12:26:32.507-04:00","updated_at":"2023-07-27T12:27:17.252-04:00","title":"mint_(elite_ii)_(arknights)","body":"[[mint_(arknights)|Mint]]'s outfit when she reaches Elite II promotion in [[Arknights]].

The dangers of the ZERO System, as well as the excessive power of the Twin Buster Rifle, are the reasons why after designing the Wing Zero, it wasn't built until After Colony 195 (and it was built by [[Quatre Raberba Winner]] instead, who found the design blueprints while undergoing a personal crisis). In its place, 5 Gundams derived from its design are developed for the Operation Meteor.\r\n\r\nIt has multiple pilots in the entire [[Gundam Wing]] TV series, but its most well-known pilot is [[Heero Yuy]], who is able to master its ZERO System and also, the most successful in piloting the Gundam itself. \r\n\r\nThe Wing Gundam Zero also appears in [I]The Glory of Losers[/I] manga as the [I]Wing Gundam Proto Zero[/I], with minor changes on its design due it being designed by [[Katoki Hajime]]. \r\n\r\nThis tag refers to [[Ookawara Kunio]]'s original design of the Wing Gundam Zero or [[Katoki Hajime]]'s Proto Zero.

This staff generally comes in three forms: [b]hooked[/b], in the shape of a shepherd's crook (curled off to one side); [b]tau[/b], in the shape of a T with downwards-curving arms topped by a small [[cross]]; and [b]serpentine[/b], with a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons curled back to face each other in an upwards-facing U with a small cross between them. \r\n\r\nThe [[fantasy]] version of the crosier tends to resemble a bastardized version of one (or several) of the above, with a small sphere or circular symmetrical  \"shepherd's crook\" bisected or topped by a large cross (the overall profile will often resemble a [[Celtic cross]]). Some versions may just be a large cross mounted on the end of a staff (with the whole staff resembling a [[Latin cross]], like the [[Pope]]'s [i]ferula[/i]). Another common fantasy variant has a scepter-like head topped off with a small cross.\r\n\r\n[[Priest]]s and fantasy [[priestess]]es are often depicted holding a crosier. Some may instead be depicted wielding a generic [[mage staff]]; such examples should not be tagged crosier.\r\n\r\nh4. Notable examples\r\n* [[Arch bishop (ragnarok online)|]] ([[Ragnarok Online]])\r\n* [[Pope_(ragnarok_online)|The Pope]] ([[Ragnarok Online]])\r\n* [[Martha_(fate)|]] ([[Fate (series)]])\r\n* [[Victorious_(azur lane)|]] ([[Azur Lane]])\r\n** Wields a golden crosier tipped with a sun cross, surmounted with a ship's bell.\r\n* [[Fan la Norne]] ([[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]])\r\n\r\nh4. Tag usage notes\r\n* Tag crosier for the priest's staff described above—both the real versions and the fantasy variants.\r\n** As a general rule, any fantasy staff that appears vaguely [[christianity|Christian]]-like (i.e. festooned with crosses and Christian motifs) will also tend to qualify.\r\n* Avoid tagging crosier for 'generic' looking staves that may be better off tagged [[staff]] or [[mage staff]].\r\n** Fantasy [[priest]]([[priestess|ess]])es are sometimes depicted holding a 'generic' crystal or gem-tipped staff without any religious trappings, one that would not look out of place being wielded by any other magic user. These examples should be tagged [[mage staff]] and not crosier.\r\n** Fire Emblem characters belonging to the priest or cleric class lines tend to just wield generic [[mage staff|mage staves]] because of [[Nintendo]] being allergic towards the depiction of crosses and other religious iconography.\r\n* [b]Do not[/b] tag [[shakujou]] (i.e. Buddhist staves) with crosier.\r\n* The [[Pope]]'s staff is a Papal ferula, but this can be tagged with crosier for now.\r\n\r\nh4.
