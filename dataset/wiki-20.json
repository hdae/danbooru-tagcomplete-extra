Some non-canon reference materials published in the 1980s speculated that the ship was a new build and was constructed for use as a testbed for the Transwarp drive project; Scotty's comments in Star Trek V about how the ship had numerous problems (and essentially broke down) on it's shakedown cruise would seem to support part of this theory.  Similarly, beyond being decommissioned after the events of Star Trek VI, the ship does not have a canon fate.

These games make up the [[Touhou (PC-98)]] era. In 2002 he returned as the one-man doujin group [i]Team Shanghai Alice[/i] and released Touhou for Windows, thus exposing it to a larger audience. \r\n\r\nThe games themselves, mostly in the [[danmaku]] (\"bullet hell\") genre, are addictive and have acquired a large following. In particular, his original music is incredibly popular and is the subject of numerous doujin remix albums.\r\n\r\nCurrently Touhou has nineteen mainstream danmaku shooter games, six danmaku spinoffs, six fighting spinoffs and an action spinoff, with the fighting games and action game made in collaboration with Tasogare Frontier. The series also has a number of supplementary materials including manga, short stories, fanbooks, and music CDs.\r\n\r\nThe backgrounds and personalities of its characters (the majority of which come from the Windows generation) are often expanded upon in doujins and, occasionally, ZUN canonizes some concepts. \r\n\r\nTouhou is also notable for being a [i]de facto[/i] open source franchise, in which ZUN allows various fan works such as doujinshi and video games to be published and sold with little to no licensing fees. This allowed the franchise to remain popular to this day.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] Don't tag individual Touhou games unless the game is directly referenced by the post. All of the characters in a picture having debuted in the same game is not enough to count. The full cast of a game (with or without the protagonists) appearing will usually count, so long as no other characters are present.\r\n\r\nA \"Direct Reference\" can include, but may not be limited to:\r\n* Depiction of [[gameplay mechanics]] found in the game (post #4907093)\r\n* Any kind of [[parody]] of the game or other work (post #4546543)\r\n* A character drawn in a pose from their official art (post #4495699)\r\n* A character wearing an outfit from a game or other work instead of their \"usual\" outfit, ranging from outfits that only differ slightly (post #4419411), to outfits that differ entirely, (e.g [[Turbo Byakuren]]). This may also include physical changes specific for a game (post #1366406)\r\n* The name of the game or other work being written in the post (post #3865937)\r\n\r\nh4#games. Games \r\n\r\nh5.

The M151 strongly resembles its predecessors, but is larger and based on a completely new platform. Visually, it is easily distinguished by its horizontally slotted front grille (since the classic vertical grille of the earlier jeeps was, by 1951, a trademarked aspect of the civilian Jeeps being sold by Willys). The M151 was replaced starting in 1983 by the [[humvee|HMMWV]], but a few examples are allegedly still used by some Special Forces units today.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":75373,"created_at":"2016-05-09T14:49:09.792-04:00","updated_at":"2024-12-21T08:56:13.134-05:00","title":"military_vehicle","body":"A vehicle that is used primarily for [[military]] (combat) purposes.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her first win was at a 2400 m race, her other wins being above that distance and her only Classics appearence being a respectable 5th place at the Kikuka Sho (3000 m. Two years later, Titleholder would win that race). After a long career running in many of Japan's longest races, Melody Lane retired on December 2024 at age 8 due to a bowed tendon.
