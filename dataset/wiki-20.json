The series was the breakout hit for its developer, Guerilla Games Studio. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to its primary competition in the form of [[Halo (series)|]] and [[Mass Effect (series)|]], Killzone was noted for having a far more grounded take on future warfare. The entirety of the story is confined to a single star system rather than spanning the whole galaxy, energy weapons are almost (but not entirely) non-existant, and both major factions - the protagonist Interplanetary Strategic Alliance and the antagonist [[Helghast]] - are human. The Helghast's glowing orange goggles, initially a gameplay conceit for visibility on the PS1's limited hardware, gave them a signature recognizable even to those unfamiliar with the Killzone series, as well.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Guerilla Games previewed a new game unrelated to previous projects, called [[Horizon (video game)|Horizon: Zero Dawn]], that would wind up being one of the best-selling games on the Playstation 4. The wild success of the Horizon series dealt the effective end to Killzone.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キルゾーン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":230066,"created_at":"2025-03-06T21:24:34.174-05:00","updated_at":"2025-03-06T21:24:34.174-05:00","title":"tokusatsu_gagaga","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["トクサツガガガ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":218087,"created_at":"2024-12-05T14:58:36.496-05:00","updated_at":"2025-03-06T21:16:50.047-05:00","title":"alcryst_(fire_emblem)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スタルーク","スタルーク(ファイアーエムブレム"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":230065,"created_at":"2025-03-06T21:08:13.806-05:00","updated_at":"2025-03-06T21:08:13.806-05:00","title":"tongue_clamp","body":"A device to keep a character's tongue out, often used in [[BDSM]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":187636,"created_at":"2024-03-21T01:23:39.451-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-06T21:08:01.478-05:00","title":"overturned_car","body":"A car that has been flipped on its side or roof.\r\n\r\nh4.

Appearance\r\n\r\nIn comparison to [[samuel b. roberts (kancolle)|Samuel B.

Her hull number is emblazoned on each side of her lower rigs.\r\n\r\nh4. Personality\r\n\r\nShe is often compared to [[amatsukaze (kancolle)|Amatsukaze]] due to both having similar [[two side up]] hairstyles and sailor outfits with gartered thighhighs as well as apparently sharing similar [[tsundere]] personalities.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe historical destroyer was part of the Taffy 3 party (which included [[samuel b. Roberts (kancolle)|Samuel B. Roberts]] and [[gambier bay (kancolle)|Gambier Bay]]) and was sunk during the \"Battle off Samar\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar] by successive firings from Kurita Takeo's forces, but not before scoring hits of her own, including those to [[kumano (kancolle)|Kumano]]. For her actions, she was given a Presidential Unit Citation and six battle stars, which shipgirl Johnston displays as one bronze star and one silver star (equivalent to five bronzes) on her collar.\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nShe's voiced by \"Shiraki Nao\":https://myanimelist.net/people/42439 and was designed by [[Zeco]]. Her namesake is \"Navy Lieutenant John V. Johnston\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_V._Johnston], who fought for the Union from 1862 to 1864 during the American Civil War. She is the game's first bona fide American destroyer, despite the fact that destroyer escort [[samuel b. roberts (kancolle)|Samuel B.
