It is piloted by [[Banagher Links]].\r\n\r\nThe Full Armor Mode was an enhancement plan devised by [[Irei Takuya]] while aboard the Nahel Argama and is based on Takuya's extensive knowledge of mobile suits. After Banagher's Newtype potential manifests itself, the [[Psycho Frame]] changes color to a vibrant green. Unlike other mobile suits with the Full Armor designation, the FA Unicorn does not consist of any additional armor for the MS frame itself (except extra [[shield|shields]]). However it does introduce a large array of weapons, which are added to the legs, backpack and forearms.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, what appears to be a haphazard collection of weaponry is actually a superbly balanced set-up which draws out the maximum combat potential of the Unicorn. The new array of weapons includes two backpack-mounted hyper bazookas, numerous hand grenades and grenade launchers, missile pods, forearm-mounted Gatling guns, and two additional I-field-equipped shields, one on the backpack and the other on the right forearm. The backpack also features two massive vernier-boosters taken from a [[base_jabber|Base Jabber Type 94]] to compensate for the increased mass, with one of the additional shields situated between them. The unit's entire weapons load can be disconnected at any time if the ammunitions are completely spent to avoid becoming dead-weight. Like the normal Unicorn, the Full Armor Unicorn can take control of an enemy's psycommu weapons, even Quasi-Psycommu bits, when the [[NT-D]] is activated.\r\n\r\nJust like the original Unicorn, its Full Armor version is designed in real life by [[Katoki Hajime]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フルアーマーユニコーンガンダム"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236398,"created_at":"2025-04-09T01:22:15.478-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T01:22:15.478-04:00","title":"touma_saya_(cosplay)","body":"[[Cosplay]] of [[SPEC]]'s [[Touma Saya]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236397,"created_at":"2025-04-09T01:14:12.641-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T01:14:12.641-04:00","title":"yoshino_prevail_(umamusume)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヨシノプリヴェール"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236396,"created_at":"2025-04-09T01:13:01.068-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T01:13:01.068-04:00","title":"akeishi_gorou","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["明石梧郎"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236395,"created_at":"2025-04-09T00:53:50.308-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:53:50.308-04:00","title":"zanhuawei","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["簪花围"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236394,"created_at":"2025-04-09T00:34:38.754-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:34:38.754-04:00","title":"my_in-laws_are_obsessed_with_me","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["시월드가_내게_집착한다","시월드가내게집착한다","老公对我太执着"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":236393,"created_at":"2025-04-09T00:32:44.838-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:33:35.930-04:00","title":"the_first_night_with_the_duke","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["남주의_첫날밤을_가져버렸다","남주의첫날밤을가져버렸다","我夺走了公爵的第一次"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145414,"created_at":"2022-06-15T16:55:56.072-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-09T00:33:13.125-04:00","title":"under_the_oak_tree","body":"[b]Under the Oak Tree[/b] is a Korean webnovel and manhwa.\r\n\r\nh4.

It's now owned by a company that rents locations for video shoots. Surprisingly for a studio frequently used to film porn, it overlooks an elementary school.\r\n\r\nThe pool virtually ceased being available for JAV shoots in 2020 due to the rising cost of facility maintenance expenses to clean up afterwards. The pool remains open for non-AV shoots such as gravure and non-pornographic shoots.\r\n\r\nDespite its reputation as a common location for JAVs, the pool has recently been featured in a handful of mainstream productions as well, including an episode of [[Kamen Rider Fourze (Series)|]].\r\n\r\nh4.
