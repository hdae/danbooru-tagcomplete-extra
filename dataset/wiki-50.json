The Joseon period has left a substantial legacy to modern Korea; much of modern Korean culture, etiquette, norms, and societal attitudes toward current issues, along with the modern [[Korean text|Korean language and its dialects]], derive from the culture and traditions of Joseon. Modern Korean bureaucracy and administrative divisions were also established during the Joseon period. \r\n\r\nIt was founded by [[Yi Seong-gye]] in July 1392 and replaced by the [[Korean Empire]] in October 1897. The kingdom was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of [[Goryeo]] in what is today the city of [[Kaesong]]. Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day [[Seoul]]. The kingdom's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amrok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens. \r\n\r\nDuring its 500-year duration, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideals and doctrines in Korean society. Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new state's ideology. [[Buddhism]] was accordingly discouraged, and occasionally Buddhists faced persecutions. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the Korean peninsula and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. In the 1590s, the kingdom was severely weakened due to the two failed Japanese invasions of 1592 and 1598. Several decades later, Joseon was invaded by the Later Jin dynasty and the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1627 and 1636–1637 respectively, leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the \"hermit kingdom\" in Western literature. After the end of these invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and technological development. What power the kingdom recovered during its isolation waned as the 18th century came to a close. Faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure, and rebellions at home, the kingdom declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\r\n\r\nh4.

Has [[brown hair|chestnut hair]] with a [[white hair|white stripe]] running off center through her bangs and a conspicuous longer white hairlock from the left side of her head. Often depicted carrying a [[folding fan]] and wearing a [[sun hat]] with a horseshoe-shaped cutout on the brim and a blue ornamental rose in front, to the right side of her head. Usually has a black-and-white cat riding on top of her hat.\r\n\r\nThe Chairwoman has a distinctive speaking style; she tends to insert a lot of two-kanji idiomatic phrases (as full sentences) in her speech. This is usually reflected in English translations by using short, curt 1-2 word sentences.\r\n\r\nWhile she was always important in the background of the game scenarios, it's only with the \"Great Food Festival\" scenario that she became able to personally contribute to the player's training as the host of that scenario.\r\n\r\nDue to her color scheme and hat (and the cat riding on top of said hat, plus said cat's color scheme), fans have speculated that she is actually [spoiler]Northern Taste under a human guise.[/spoiler] As such, she is sometimes drawn [spoiler]as a [[horse girl]][/spoiler] with her hat off.

Generally used in the sense of: 1. To finish a given [[horse girl]]'s training scenario in the [[Umamusume]] game; 2. To get along very well or \"buddy buddy\" with a given girl (or [[Kiryuuin Aoi]]); or 3. To \"go all the way\" or do all sorts of implied hanky panky things with a given girl (or again, [[Kiryuuin Aoi]]). \r\n\r\nEffectively used as a euphemism in most fan comics, especially in 'comedic' scenarios, where it usually involves a girl going [[yandere]] on the [[Trainer (umamusume)|]] and alleging the latter [i]umapyoi[/i]-ing the other girls. Occasionally it is [[Happy Meek (Umamusume)|]] accusing [[Kiryuuin Aoi]] (of going out with the [[Trainer (umamusume)|]]), as a reference to one of the in-game events.\r\n\r\nA common variation used by fans (but not in official media) is \"onsen umapyoi\", occasionally abbreviated to \"onsenpyoi\" (温泉ぴょい). This can refer to either: 1. to finish a given [[horse girl]]'s training scenario with the semi-secret hot spring event unlocked, which requires the player to randomly acquire the Hot Spring Tickets in that scenario and win the URA final, or 2. from the above, to \"go all the way\" at the hot spring [i]ryokan[/i] with a given girl (or, yet again, [[Kiryuuin Aoi]]). \r\n\r\nSince the release of the Aoharu training mode, [[Kashimoto Riko]] has joined [[Kiryuuin Aoi]] in the list of possible umapyoi-ees (or, alternatively, umapyoi-ers).\r\n\r\nThe song also features other 'nonsensical' portmanteau words such as [i]umadacchi[/i], [i]sukidacchi[/i] and [i]umapoi[/i] (without the 'y'), all of which are also co-opted by the fanbase for pretty much the same meanings as [i]umapyoi[/i] above. As such, these examples can also be tagged umapyoi.\r\n\r\nUsage of all these four words has also spread to other fanbases.\r\n\r\nThis tag should generally not be used when the words occur as part of the [[Umapyoi Densetsu]] song, i.e. the characters are singing the song normally in their original context.\r\n\r\nh4.

His eyes are [[blue eyes|blue]].\r\n\r\nAkechi Hideki is the leader of his university's mahjong club. Even though Hideki was raised through prestigious ivy league schooling, however he always shows his courteous nature and gives a warm smile to anyone he meets. Influenced by his grandmother, Hideki often likes to make local yaku even if the rule doesn't allow for this. There seems to be a shroud of mystery to his past. Every time someone brings up relatable topics of the past, Hideki would slyly change the topic entirely.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was created by [[Matsumoto Leiji]] and Nishizaki Yoshinobu in the early [[1970s_(style)|1970s]]. \r\n\r\nThe first TV anime series aired on Yomiuri TV in October 6, 1974 and was followed by several animated movie sequels and two more TV series seasons (broadcast in 1978 and 1980 respectively). \r\n\r\nIt is notable because it was one of the first military science fiction anime that depicted space battleships and cosmic [[battle]]s among fleets of spaceships. Its creators were also inspired by [[Star Trek]] when the series was being developed. \r\n\r\nUchuu Senkan Yamato influenced several later sci-fi anime like [[Gundam]], [[Macross]], [[Top wo Nerae!]] (Gunbuster) and [[Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu]] (Legend of the Galactic Heroes) among others. It also influenced various productions in the west, like [[Star Wars]] and [[Battlestar Galactica]] (both the original and re-imagined versions).\r\n\r\nIt is known to English-speaking audiences as [b][i]Space Battleship Yamato[/i][/b] and also as [i][b][[Star Blazers]][/b][/i]. In Spanish and Latin American countries it was called [b][i]Astronave Intrepido[/i][/b] (\"Starship Intrepid\").

Episode 0\r\n\r\nEpisode 0, which is counter-intuitively the second novel released, is a short \"fandisk\" that takes place before the events of episode 1, and gives the player character's sister a much larger role. It's also somewhat of a showcase of new features not present in the first game, which include the ability to directly interact with the cast by clicking on them.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 1\r\n\r\nEpisode 1, the first novel released, centers on the characters [[Chocola (nekopara)|]] and [[Vanilla (nekopara)|]], whom the main character lives with, sleeps with and eventually has sex with. While Chocola and Vanilla are the main characters, the novel also includes a supporting cast of four other cat girls and the player character's sister.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 2\r\n\r\nEpisode 2, the third novel released, adds [[Coconut (nekopara)|]] and [[Azuki (nekopara)|]] to the center character group. The two were formerly members of the supporting cast. \r\n\r\nh6. Episode 3\r\n\r\nEpisode 3, the fourth novel released, focuses on [[Cinnamon (nekopara)|]] and [[Maple (nekopara)|]]. As with [[Coconut (nekopara)|]] and [[Azuki (nekopara)|]] before them, they started as supporting characters.\r\n\r\nh6. Episode 4\r\n\r\nThe fifth novel released, Episode 4 focuses on the player character [[Minazuki Kashou]] and his family, exploring his past. It also introduces a new supporting character, [[Fraise (nekopara)|]].\r\n\r\nAn otome game spinoff titled [[Nekopara - Catboys Paradise]] was released in 2021. The spinoff was originally presented simply as an April Fool's joke in 2019, but due to unexpected high demand, it would later be made into a full game.\r\n\r\nh4.
