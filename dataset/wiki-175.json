Despite the official name being Reginleif, they're commonly referred to by their pilots by the nickname Juggernaut.\r\n\r\nThe XM-2 Reginleif is a Feldreß (multi-legged armored-weapon system) developed and produced by the Federal Republic of Giad.  Based on recovered [[M1A4 Juggernaut]]s, the Reginlef is designed for speed and mobility at the expense of armor and firepower compared to the Federal Republic's other Feldreßs.  Compared to the Juggernaut though, it features significantly more armor and safety features for its pilots.  These included a fully sealed temperature controlled cockpit and armor strong enough to withstand the 7.62 mm machineguns equipped to the basic legion scout units, which could readily penetrate the armor of a Juggernaut.\r\n\r\nh6.

It appears similar to an fighter plane body with 4 legs instead of wings and a large [[cannon]] mounted on top with its ammunition magazine hanging in the back. In series it is described as looking like a prowling spider.\r\n\r\nThe M1A4 Juggernaut is labelled as a military \"drone\" by the Republic of San Magnolia, though it is actually a piloted Feldreß (multi-legged armored-weapon system).  Given the official labelling as a drone, the armor and life-preserving equipment were either minimal or not present in the design.  The cockpit was enclosed by a clam-shell armored canopy, but as this prevented the pilot from seeing out they would have to depend on viewscreens for sight.  These viewscreens were of low resolution though, and so resulted in poor visibility for pilots.  The joint connecting the armored canopy was also not particularly durable, so a strong impact could dislodge the canopy from the Juggernaut.  Given the design of the cockpit this would also result in the canopy decapitating the pilot, and as such the canopy was also referred to as \"the guillotine.\"  Due to poor quality control in their manufacturing the canopy would not form a complete seal over the cockpit, thus leaving the pilot exposed to the environment outside. \r\n\r\nh6.

Her name was \"Koopa\" and she wasn't much to look at: she had like dirty green hair that reached just past her shoulders and wore very basic almost colorless clothes and she looked constantly very nervous and shy. I was told by my irl boss to support her for some reason, and I had to do that on /hlgg/ where everyone was shitting on her for being boring and never saying anything. I reluctantly had to defend her but I didn't have my keyboard so I had to say all my posts into a telephone that ringed even though I was already talking into it. Any dream specialists here who could tell me what the fuck any of that meant?\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nKoopa would debut on December 1, 2020 using a self-made 3D model, and on February 8, 2021 she switched to a [[Live2D]] model (post #4329454).

A long time ago, when she adventured with the previous generation of warriors Kaden and Erina, her cold and calm tendencies made her an excellent comrade for the party. After finishing their adventure, she united the chaotic nation and made herself Queen with her stern and realistic features that make her a perfect leader.\r\n\r\nLilith is assisted by the Old Swordsman Erina. They met each other while Lilith was still a young child and Erina was still an active Warrior. The two of them have been taking care of each other for over hundreds of years as friends and annoying family. It's obvious why Lilith worries about Erina since she has lived past the life expectancy of an average human, but Erina doesn't pay no mind to Lilith's nagging and usually wanders off somewhere. Lilith's desk is rumored to be always neat and free of any objects, because she would end up tossing all them at Erina and breaking everything. However, when Erina is in a dire situation, Lilith would always show up to help. Albeit she nags and clicks her tongue when she arrives\r\n\r\nShe is famous for taking care of herself. She maintains a strict diet and exercise regimen and is the founder of the famous \"Morning Routine for the Success\" in Demon World, consisting of waking up early morning, jogging, meditation, and cold showers. She abstains from eating sweets, so when she does, she only allows the best. Lilith is especially strict on the quality of cookies. If there's one thing everyone isn't aware of about perfect Lilith, it's that she is in a constant battle against her less-perfect self. When she can't win against her sloth every few decades, she uses low blood pressure as an excuse to get out of working out..","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":124567,"created_at":"2021-05-21T07:08:49.765-04:00","updated_at":"2021-05-21T07:08:49.765-04:00","title":"kushala_daora","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クシャルダオラ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":31256,"created_at":"2011-12-26T02:51:31.080-05:00","updated_at":"2021-05-20T18:07:51.710-04:00","title":"gomu_(chewinggom)","body":"Hentai artist.\r\n\r\nArtist name: ゴム (Gom or Gomu)\r\nPixiv username: go-m\r\nTwitter account name: chewinggom","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":95915,"created_at":"2018-03-20T22:43:26.812-04:00","updated_at":"2021-05-20T18:07:21.014-04:00","title":"animal-themed_umbrella","body":"An [[umbrella]] designed after a particular animal.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":71721,"created_at":"2016-01-19T13:35:38.606-05:00","updated_at":"2021-05-20T18:06:00.411-04:00","title":"food-themed_ornament","body":"An ornament that adorns a character's body [b]other[/b] than their hair and ears.
