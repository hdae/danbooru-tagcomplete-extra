Notable traits of his include his [[purple hair]], [[breastplate|golden chestplate]], and an [[Cross Scar|X-Shaped]] [[scar]] on his forehead.\r\n\r\nKrauser is a powerful fighter who is eager to fight strong opponents. In [[Fatal Fury 2]], he arranges his own King of Fighters tournament, in hopes of fighting strong opponents. He injures several veteran fighters from the previous King of Fighters tournament and he also hires three fighters to serve him who are [[Billy Kane]], [[Axel Hawk]], and [[Laurence Blood]]. Eventually, he fights [[Terry Bogard]] in the finals. After a fierce battle, Krauser is defeated and remains missing from the fighting scene. [spoiler] According to the short movie, Memories of Stray Wolves, Krauser supposedly took his own life soon after. [/spoiler]\r\n\r\nIn The King of Fighters series, nothing was heard of from Krauser until [[The King of Fighters '96]] tournament, when Krauser joined forces with Geese and [[mr big (snk)|Mr. Big]] to create the Boss Team. Although Geese used both him and Mr. Big as pawns in his attempt to nab an ancient power called [[orochi (kof)|Orochi]], Krauser only cared about self-improvement. After learning of his faults at the hands of Terry, Krauser vowed only to fight stronger opponents in order to restore the strength and prestige he once possessed. For now, Krauser wants only to improve himself first.\r\n\r\n* The infamous SNK boss and King of Fighters character; [[Rugal Bernstein]], uses one of Krauser's signature moves, the [b][i][i]Kaiser Wave[/i][/i][/b].\r\n* His debut theme is \"Dies Irae\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_Irae.\r\n* He is one of the only SNK characters to be fully voiced in English by an English voice actor (B.J.
