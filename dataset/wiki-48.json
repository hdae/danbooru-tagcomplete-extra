It is intended to be worn with a [[shirt]] or two (often a [[crop top]] or bandeau) above and/or beneath it.\r\n\r\nThis differs from [[breastless leotard]] which is a type of lingerie or erotic-wear intended to leave the breasts exposed, and is usually cut differently (sometimes omitting the straps altogether or combining them into a halterneck).\r\n\r\nh4.

Written in the period of 1895–1897, the book is one of the earliest realistic stories that details a conflict between mankind and a more advanced and hostile extraterrestrial race. \r\n\r\nAt the time of publication it was classified as a scientific romance. The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never gone out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It is one of the first works of fiction known to depict alien [[mecha]].\r\n\r\nIt has even influenced the work of [[real life]] [[scientist]]s, most notably American rocket scientist [[Robert Hutchings Goddard]].\r\n\r\nh4.

They are known for their five symmetrical, finely overlapping petals and bright colors in shades of pink, red, blue, and purple; the center is often white. The flowers often have a distinctive star shape in the center, which is often emphasized by artists. Depending on the species, the leaves can be heart-shaped or ivy-shaped (three-lobed). Morning glory [[vines]] are often trained to climb [[trellis]]es but will eagerly climb [[fence]]s as well.\r\n\r\nAs morning glories are easy to grow, Japanese elementary schools often have their students grow them as part of their plant cultivation experience. It is typical summer homework for Japanese students to bring home the morning glories (that they have grown to a certain extent at school) and observe and record their growth (note that summer vacation is in the middle of the school year in Japan).\r\n\r\nIts common Japanese name, アサガオ (朝顔 [i]asa-gao[/i]), literally translates to \"morning face\". There is a night-blooming species, [i]Ipomoea alba[/i], commonly called [[moonflower (flower)|]]. Its common Japanese name is ヨルガオ (夜顔 [i]yoru-gao[/i]), which literally translates to \"night face\".\r\n\r\nh4.
