Plot summary\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, people build their homes and raise domestic animals in subterranean caverns. As a result, they live in fear of the occasional earthquake and cave-in, and have been for hundreds of years. Jeeha is one such village.\r\n\r\nOne day, a boy named [[Simon (ttgl)|]] happens to find a small, shiny drill while digging to expand the village. At the same time, [[Kamina (ttgl)|]], a guy who believes that there is another land above the village, persuades a gangster to break through the ceiling in order to leave the cavern. Suddenly, an earthquake occurs and the ceiling collapses, followed by a big [[robot]] breaking through the ceiling.\r\n\r\nKamina is now sure that there is a world above them. Recklessly, he begins to fight against the robot. At that moment, another person appears from the land above. It is a girl by the name of [[Yoko Littner|Yoko]]. With a [[rifle]] in hand, she had been tracking the robot. However, all she could do was distract it. Then, Simon shows what he had found to Kamina and Yoko. It's a mysterious robot whose head is also its body.\r\n\r\nh4.

Originally a boy from a Romani family, he witnessed his mother's death at the hands of some demons she had summoned to fight Latverian soldiers. Swearing revenge, he began to master magic and technology. Eventually, he traveled to America to study some more, and that is where he met (and eventually became foes with) [[Reed Richards]].\r\n\r\nDue to an incident involving constructing a portal to Hell to resurrect his mother, Doom blamed Richards for the incident for causing the scars on his face. He constructed a suit of metal armor and became the cloaked tyrant scientist known today. He considers himself to be the smartest man on Earth and shows signs of politeness to his enemies. He's known for talking about himself in the third person and for having several \"Doombots\" that can pose as him.\r\n\r\nAside the Fantastic Four, Doom has faced nearly every superhero in the Marvel Universe: [[Avengers (series)|The Avengers]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[X-Men]], to name a few.\r\n\r\nDoom appears in various Marvel-related media, such as movies, TV shows, and video games. Among one of his most famous appearances is in the [[Marvel vs. Capcom]] series of fighting games, where he is a playable character. In Japan, his [[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|1967 animated version]], known as Akuma Hakase, or Dr. Demon, is fondly remembered by older fans for being a more comedic spin on the character, speaking in [[Nagoyaben]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Dr.ドゥーム","ドクター・ドゥーム","ドクタードゥーム","ヴィクター・フォン・ドゥーム","Dr.Doom","DoctorDoom","悪魔博士"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":237774,"created_at":"2025-04-14T01:19:12.268-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-14T01:19:12.268-04:00","title":"dental_floss","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["デンタルフロス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":176808,"created_at":"2023-11-10T11:43:22.642-05:00","updated_at":"2025-04-14T01:16:49.729-04:00","title":"janggi","body":"Janggi, sometimes called Korean chess, is a strategy board game popular on the Korean Peninsula.

While it was a comprehensive all-round improvement over the pitiful [[Hizack]], its weapon selection was much more limited, as it could only load advanced beam weapons. Later replaced by the more capable [[Barzam]] in frontline service. \r\n\r\nAfter the [[zeta_gundam|Gryphs War]] the last surviving Marasai units were acquired by [[Neo Zeon]] who used them to fill their ranks with a gray color scheme several years later. Some optimized green and grey Marasais even ended up being used by [[full_frontal|\"The Sleeves\"]] during their [[gundam_unicorn|Attack on Torrington Base]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["マラサイ","RMS-108"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":227109,"created_at":"2025-02-18T19:17:23.111-05:00","updated_at":"2025-04-13T18:41:45.898-04:00","title":"luxury_(idolmaster)","body":"LUXURY is a category of costumes from [[Idolmaster 2]] and [[Idolmaster One for All]].

More than 80,000 T-34s and its variants were produced by the Soviet Union during WWII, making it the most produced tank of the whole war. Because of this some experts have even declared that the T-34 is \"the tank that saved the Soviet Union\".\r\n\r\nAt its introduction, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, speed, protection, and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its heavy sloped armor was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. Its engine was small and efficient, also providing very high speed and a long autonomy and range. However, this come at the cost of atrocious crew ergonomics as the crew of four (later five in the late [[T-34-85]] variant) were tightly packed in frontal compartment.\r\n\r\nh4.
