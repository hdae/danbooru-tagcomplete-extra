The dance is called \"ｳｯｰｳｯｰｳﾏｳﾏ(ﾟ∀ﾟ) ([i]U-u-uma uma[/i])\" or \"ウマウマダンス ([i]Uma uma dance[/i])\" in Japan, spreading even further there following [[Exit Tunes]] obtaining the rights to the song from the original producers, releasing the original and sped-up remix to great success.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of posts under this tag reference the visual part of the flash, which comes from the opening animation of the Popotan game and has nothing to do with the Caramell song.
