[b]Danbooru currently does not distinguish [i]eboshi[/i] from ancient Japanese [i]kanmuri[/i] (冠).[/b]\r\n\r\nPhysically, the kanmuri stands out thanks to the \"koji (巾子)\", a cylindrical shape that stands upright from the top of the headwear, and the \"ei (纓)\", string-shaped cloth which hangs down from the rear of the headwear towards the wearer's back. The Japanese at the time when kanmuri were still simple sack-like shapes had a topknot on their head. They wore kanmuri by putting the topknot through a tube and binding the root of the topknot wearing this sack and letting the rest of the string hang down their backs. The terms \"koji\" and \"ei\", which were used even when the shape and quality of the kanmuri changed, serve as a reminder of this older form. \r\n\r\nNotably worn by [[Mononobe no Futo]] and [[Soga no Tojiko]] of the [[Touhou]] series.\r\n\r\nh4.

Each player uses a racket that is strung to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net into his opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a good return. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including people in wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nThe player gets 15 points each time his opponent either misses the ball, strikes the ball to the outside of the court or the net, or fails to serve the ball twice. The player can only get a maximum of 40 points. Upon winning a break point, the player wins the game and this continues after the player wins 6 games or 2 more games than his opponent, thus winning the set.\r\n\r\nIf the game system is best of 3, the player must win 2 sets to win the match. If it is best of 5, he must win 3 sets to do exactly the same.\r\n\r\nh4.[[Sportswear]]\r\n* !post #7342295: [[tennis dress]]\r\n* !post #8064484: [[tennis skirt]]\r\n* !post #7646868: [[tennis uniform]]\r\n* !post #3315444: [[wristband]]\r\n* !post #300209: [[visor cap]]\r\n\r\nh4.Tennis\r\n* !post #5109048: [[beach tennis]]\r\n* !post #8202408: [[table tennis]]\r\n\r\nh4.Related tags\r\n* !post #7494766: [[holding tennis racket]]\r\n* !post #5447050: [[tennis court]]\r\n* !post #8053258: [[tennis ball]]\r\n* !post #3836356: [[tennis net]]\r\n* !post #6080233: [[tennis racket]]\r\n* !post #8297725: [[tennis racket case]]\r\n* !post #8486284: [[umpire]]\r\n* !post #3154850: [[umpire chair]]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n* [[playing sports]]\r\n* [[tag group:sports]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["テニス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":41514,"created_at":"2013-01-09T12:27:58.206-05:00","updated_at":"2024-11-26T04:26:32.922-05:00","title":"tearing_up","body":"The [[tears]] that form in the eyes just before [[crying]].\r\n\r\nFor tearing paper, clothing or other items, use [[ripping]] or [[torn]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["涙目","泣き顔","哭泣之前","泪目"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":75036,"created_at":"2016-04-30T11:57:01.558-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-26T03:08:44.783-05:00","title":"spread_anus","body":"A person's [[anus]] held wide open, exposing their rectal cavity.\r\n\r\nh4.
