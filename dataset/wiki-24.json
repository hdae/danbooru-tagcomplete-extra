The column advised women to act ditzy and cute by doing things like pretending not to be able to eat [[omurice]] because of feeling bad about the chick dying when the eggs are broken.\r\n\r\n\"Four techniques for improving girls with girl power from such things as 'Attracting guys by being a woman who won't even eat an omelet.'\":http://youpouch.com/2011/04/26/162331/ - August 26, 2011\r\n\r\n[expand=Translated article]Hello, I am Lady Ebios a specialist in love management. I am an ugly person without an academic history or much common sense, but when it comes to love I am a professional. This time I think I should teach everyone about the four ways to improve women by using girl power.\r\n\r\n1. Taking your two to three generations old [[cellphone]] to drinking parties\r\n\r\nLets make use of the two to three generations old cellphone. So at a drinking party talk to a man you like, and try to bring out your cellphone on purpose. Then say \"Aww, I really hate using this cellphone!\", it will make the man say \"What's wrong.\" If he says this its been a big success. Say something like \"I don't know much about cellphones~! I've been using this one for so long~! Its so hard to use! [b]Punpukuriin![/b] (Anger).\" Since men usually want to have new cellphones, even if its old they are at least using last generations cellphones.\r\n\r\nWith that the man will definitely say \"Why don't you buy a new one?\" (Guys who don't say this and can't read the situation should in that moment be ignored and then move on). Then you will respond with \"Well well~! Isn't the new iPhone5 popular-!? How is it? I want a new one but have no idea!! I'm so pitiful ★.\" Then the man will start to say \"The iPhone4 right? They haven't made the 5 yet. You really don't know much do you. What kind do you want?\" Then the next day off both of you will go on a date to choose cellphones. If your girl power is strong, then the guy might possibly buy the cellphone for you!?\r\n\r\n2. Being able to use [[> <]] on Twitter\r\n\r\nThings like \"Ah-!\" or \"I'm sad\" can be expressed with \"[[> <]]\" in comments, and then the Twitter's male users will think \"This girl is kind of cute\" or \"I kind of want to help her.\" Images on the internet are more applicable to other users rather than in the world like having many uses for \"[[> <]]\" which will mistakenly make men think you are a pitiful woman. If you become this kind of character almost always ignore that you will be hated by the same sex.\r\n\r\n3. For the time being always say to guys \"Really-! What is that!? Tell me tell me. ♪\"\r\n\r\nGuys always talk about nothing but bragging and their hobbies when talking to girls at things like drinking parties. Thus, for girls its always a boring story. However, if you respond with the usual responses like \"Wow, really~?\" or \"I don't really get it, but that's amazing,\" then the guy will notice that \"This girl is no good.\" If you are revealed as a girl with not merit its over. It is then instead to say unintentionally with a lot of spirit, \"Really-! What is that!? Tell me Tell me ♪.\" For instance, even its not a story about interests, then get through the situation with high spirits and positivity. Men have a weakness for women that will assertively listen to them talk.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to different stories, then comment with something like \"something, something, something right! Oh, I just remembered! Memo Memo!\" and it will be perfect. Continuing on, point at your head and spin your finger around saying \"[b]Kyun kyun kyun! Kyun kyun kyun![/b]\" \"What's wrong?\" the guy might say. Then if you say \"I am just recording it to my hard disk\" your girl power will go up! With this the guy will again think \"Wow this girl is interesting and cute!?\" I don't have any academic history or much knowledge and I am ugly, but with if I use this kind of technique then even my non knowledgeable self that is a stupid woman can be popular. All because men want to feel like they are superior.\r\n\r\n4. Attracting guys by being a woman who won't even eat [[omurice]] in a restaurant\r\n\r\nIf you go into a restaurant with a man, find the first thing you can with [[omurice]] or eggs in it and say \"A-w! I can't even eat this~ (Sadness).\" Then 100 percent he will ask \"Why not? Do you not like it?\" and you will respond with \"I don't not like it, I just can't eat it [[> <]].\" Again 100 percent he will ask \"Since you don't not like it why can't you eat it?\" and you will look down for 3~5 seconds and in between then say idly \"...well,...well, if you break an egg then won't the chick die! Its so sad! It isn't even born yet~(Sadness). It won't even be able to chirp....\" and shake a little while saying this.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, your girl power will go up. The man will definitely be charmed by you and from the bottom of his heart vow that \"You are such a nice angelic like person! I will definitely get her! She is going to be my woman!\" In the man's mind once you start dating, then forget about that sort of thing and only if you like it then it's okay to eat omelets. If he says \"Didn't you say that you couldn't eat it?\" then its okay to say something like \"It's okay to eat it now\" or \"I've gotten used to it,\" or \"I've never said that.\"\r\n\r\n(Article = Love management by Lady Ebios)\r\n[/expand]\r\n\r\nThis article has a sequel.

This later spawned tons of parodies around [i]pants wrestling[/i] and related people that acted in non-pants wrestling porn with a pants wrestler as an actor in the aforementioned porno.\r\n\r\nIt is often paired with [[Manatsu no yo no Inmu]] (Inmu-chu) and [[Kuso Miso Technique]] ([[Yaranaika]]) as the \"Holy Homo Trinity\" (御三ゲイ), since all three were well-known homoerotic memes that were popular within Japanese communities in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nWhile Gachi parodies did find their way outside of Japan, most prominently between 2007 and 2012, it wasn't until later from 2015 onwards that it spread even further under the name [b]gachiGASM[/b] (named after the BTTV emotes for [[Twitch.tv]] featuring Billy Herrington's iconic face) and spawned countless more sub-memes.\r\n\r\nWhile Gachimuchi's popularity has decreased with the Japanese (being supplanted by Inmu on Niconico), Gachimuchi is currently extremely popular internationally. On the Chinese video site [[Bilibili]], the Chinese started making parodies of their popular TV series and movies, and also parodies of Japanese anime. Many Gachimuchi videos became some of the most viewed videos on Bilibili (one having had over 5 million views). This popularity would, however, lead to Bilibili attempting to squash the community on the site, leading to it dispersing across other Chinese communities. It also became popular in Russia, where a live-action parody and various music remix was made of it in spite of the country's anti-homosexual laws.\r\n\r\nThe tag used for Gachimuchi on Bilibili and in Chinese communities is [b]哲♂学 (Learning♂Philosophy)[/b].\r\n\r\nh4.

Although his role in the Street Fighter story is minimal, he is considered the third leading male character in the series, after [[Ryu (street fighter)|]] and [[ken masters|Ken]], largely due to his effectiveness as a character and his popularity.\r\n\r\nWhen Guile was a Lieutenant in the United States Air Force, he befriended his superior officer, [[charlie nash|Charlie]] and asked him to teach him in his unique form of fighting, which Charlie agreed to do. Guile learned the style, but his hot temper caused him to be not as proficient in the moves as Charlie was (shown in how Charlie can shoot Sonic Booms with just one hand while Guile needs both.)\r\n\r\nGuile has a wife, [[Julia (street fighter)|]] (ユリア), and daughter, [[Chris (street fighter)|]] (クリス, known as Amy internationally). Also, Julia and [[eliza masters|Eliza]] are actually sisters, making Ken and Guile brothers-in-law. However, this is not often discussed because, despite mutual respect as fighters, they do not think very highly of one another — Guile believes Ken to be a spoiled rich kid; Ken feels Guile is just another meathead soldier. In [[Street Fighter IV (series)|]], if Ken beats Guile, he'll refer to him as his \"brother-in-law\". \r\n\r\nThere's a [[meme|running gag]] about his theme music from Street Fighter II \"fitting in\" or \"going with\" every scene or moment imaginable.\r\nAlso, a meme called [b]Waiting Guile (待ちガイル)[/b] refers to the strategy wherein the player crouches in the corner waiting for the opponent to approach, only to then hit them with either one of his charge moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for his character comes from [[rudolph von stroheim|JoJo's Rudolph von Stroheim]].\r\n\r\nh4.

They can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat colour or combination of colours (including [[white cat|white]]).\r\n\r\nOriginally called [b]lop-eared[/b] or [b]lops[/b] after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as [b]Highland Fold[/b], [b]Scottish Fold Longhair[/b], [b]Longhair Fold[/b] and [b]Coupari[/b].\r\n\r\nAll Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia, a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the ear fold in the breed and studies point to all Fold cats being affected by it. Fold cats therefore have malformed bone structures and can develop severe painful degenerative joint diseases at an early age. Due to these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several countries and some major cat registries do not recognise the cat breed.\r\n\r\nh4.

She wears a [[long_sleeves|long-sleeved]] white and grey [[frilled dress]] that has [[cleavage cutout|cleavage]] and [[armpit cutout]]s. She bears visibly oversized [[rigging]] mainly composed of [[cannon]]s, [[ship turret|turret]]s, and [[smokestack]]s, including her three triple- and two-twin 305-mm guns.\r\n\r\nThe short length of the historical battleship translates to a petite childlike appearance that is belied only by her [[large breasts]] and mature voice, to the point she is oftentimes mistaken for being an [[oppai loli]]. Because she is the oldest and shortest battleship in the game, her lines have her being [[height conscious]], having back pain due to her [[rigging]], and complaining about the other Italian shipgirls already in the base, particularly [[Pola (kancolle)|]] and several of the [[Maestrale (kancolle)|]]-class girls for their behavior and [[Roma (kancolle)|]] for calling her nosy and old. She does go along well with [[Gangut (Kancolle)|]] as long as she is not served vodka all the time.\r\n\r\nThe historical [i]Conte di Cavour[/i] was the nameship of the three [i]Conte di Cavour[/i]-class dreadnought battleships of the [[Regia Marina]]. She served in both world wars, although she saw no action in World War I. She was badly damaged by British torpedo bombers in November 1940 and deliberately run aground. Repairs were never completed by the time of the Italian armistice in 1943. She was captured by the Germans, but they made no efforts to complete her repairs. She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized a week later. She was eventually scrapped in 1946.\r\n\r\nh4.
