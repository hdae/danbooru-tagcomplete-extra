An additional version, Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0, was released in the same year for [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game focuses on street racing-oriented gameplay involving a selection of events and racing circuits found within the fictional city of Rockport, with the game's main story involving players taking on the role of a street racer who must compete against 15 of the city's most elite street racers to become the most wanted racer of the group, in the process seeking revenge against one of the groups who took their car and developing a feud with the city's police department.\r\n\r\nMost Wanted brought in many notable improvements and additions over other entries in the series, its major highlight being more in-depth [[police]] pursuits. Certain editions of the game were also packaged with the ability for online multiplayer gaming. Upon its release, the game received positive reviews from critics and became a commercial success, selling 16 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best entries in the series as a result. Its success later led to a collector's edition, Black Edition, which provided additional content for the game.\r\n\r\nThe game was later succeeded by [[Need for Speed: Carbon]] in 2006, which provided a sequel to Most Wanted's story, with a virtual edition being made available for [[PlayStation 3]] via the PlayStation Store in May 2012, until it was discontinued the following year. A reboot of the game, developed by Criterion Games, was released in October 2012.\r\n\r\nThe cover car for the game is a customized version of the [[BMW M3]] GT-R racecar, which has since become one of the most iconic hero cars in the franchise and made return appearances in many succeeding titles.\r\n\r\nh4.

Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes. The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being spoken.\r\n\r\nFirst documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and [[Nazi]] Germany (1933–1945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and liberal revolution. The Gründerzeit era's industrialization-induced economic boom multiplied Berlin's population rapidly. Berlin in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the world by population.\r\n\r\nAfter [[World War II]] and its [[battle of berlin|subsequent occupation]] by the victorious countries, the devastated city was divided during the [[Cold War]]; West Berlin became a de facto exclave of [[West Germany]], surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] (from August 1961 to November 1989) and East German territory. East Berlin was declared capital of [[East Germany]], while [[Bonn]] became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\r\n\r\nBerlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention venues. Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination. Significant industries also include information technology, healthcare, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction, electronics, social economy and clean tech.\r\n\r\nBerlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, Technical University, Free University, University of the Arts, ESMT Berlin, Hertie School, and Bard College Berlin. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With Babelsberg being the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions. The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, and high quality of life.\r\n\r\nBerlin is also home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Modernism Housing Estates. Other landmarks include the [[Brandenburg Gate]], [[Reichstag]] building, Potsdamer Platz, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Berlin Wall Memorial, East Side Gallery, Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral, and [[Berlin Television Tower]], the tallest structure in Germany. Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras, and sporting events including Museum Island, the German Historical Museum, Jewish Museum, Natural History Museum, State Library, State Opera, Philharmonic, and the Berlin Marathon.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ベルリン","伯林","西ベルリン","東ベルリン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":16104,"created_at":"2010-01-07T00:30:31.290-05:00","updated_at":"2024-07-16T08:59:32.932-04:00","title":"soviet","body":"Anything related to the former Soviet Union, and, to a wider extent, the Warsaw Pact.\r\n\r\nThe [b]Soviet Union[/b] (1917-1991), officially the [b]Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)[/b], was a vast [[communism|communist]] federated state in what is today [[Russia]] and other adjacent nations with a state ideology of [[Karl Marx|Marxism]]-[[Vladimir Lenin|Leninism]].

She mainly did gaming content, but later, on Twitch, began preferring chatting and reaction streams over videogames. By September 2021, she was among the top most subscribed Latin American VTubers, and among its most infamous. She retired from VTubing November 17th, 2023, after a series of allegations against her were confirmed, and briefly stepped out of the limelight, before later returning as a regular streamer..\r\n\r\nAccording to her VTuber lore, her true body is the purple [[blob]] in her head, which is actually an alien parasite that has spent thousands of years switching into and out of human bodies (with the promise that she'll fulfill whatever wish they want, so long as she gets to take control). Her current host is a [[brown hair|brown-haired]] girl nicknamed [[Centi (Nimu)|]].\r\n\r\nHer default costume (post #4784811) is a [[see-through shirt]], [[white legwear|white]] [[thighhighs]] and a [[purple dress]] with [[starry sky print|star motifs]]. She has [[short hair]] with [[hairclip]]s.\r\n\r\nHer second costume (post #4786856) is an [[off-shoulder shirt]], white thighhighs and a [[white skirt]]. Her hair is dyed with [[streaked hair|purple and blue streaks]]. She has her hair tied in [[low twintails]] with [[star hair ornament|star ornaments]].\r\n\r\nHer third and final costume (post #4786860) makes her look much older, probably due to Centi reaching puberty. Now she has [[long hair]] and a purple [[hair bow]]. She wears a purple [[gradient dress]], keeping the thighhighs and the starry motifs.\r\n\r\nh4.

She likes [[yaoi|BL-stuff]], which she keeps as a secret from her friends.\r\n\r\nVert wears a dress that is primarily green with gold markings along with a pink bow that adorns the top of her skirt, as well as green and white gloves. At the collar of her dress is a gold piece with a blue gem in the center along with a maroon and gold ribbon. Vert has [[blonde hair]] [[long hair|that reaches her waist]], along with [[blue eyes]] that aren't always fully open, which may attest to her constant gaming. She has the [[large breasts|second-largest breast size]] of the entire extended cast. Initially the largest, she was dethroned by [[Magic the Hard]] in the sequel [[Choujigen Game Neptune Mk2]], who sports an H cup.\r\n\r\nVert is the only CPU who doesn't get a 'sister'.

First released in 2005, the mod started off as a balance modification created by Speeder and Mevitar, who would later grow into the Mentalmeisters team. After a few years, the mod had grown into a de facto unofficial sequel, with version 3.3 adding a new faction - the Foehn Revolt.\r\nMental Omega APYR uses the Ares Expansion DLL which allows new features to be added into the gameplay by adding new units and rebalancing existing ones, making the mod almost completely different than the original Yuri's Revenge and more suitable for multiplayer gameplay, which is the mod's aim to make it perfectly balanced (hence why the mod is tagged as an \"Almost Perfect Yuri's Revenge\").\r\n\r\nMental Omega APYR features new campaigns for the Allies, Soviets, and Yuri, continuing from where Command & Conquer: Red Alert left off and branches into an alternate, expanded universe which spans over 80 missions divided into two different acts related to two stages of the game's story: the Soviet invasion to the United States and the war against Yuri. Cooperative modes for 2 players are also available.It expands upon the original game by taking on an alternative story from the events that led to Red Alert 2's plot on a campaign that spans throughout 97 campaign missions and 36 cooperative missions.\r\n\r\nMental Omega also incorporates numerous additions such as an entirely new faction; the Foehn Revolt, new units divided in three specific subfactions for each faction which have their own specializations, new gameplay features, new skirmish maps, new soundtrack unique to each faction, and more.\r\n\r\nMental Omega APYR also features the addition of hundreds of new skirmish maps and a variety of game modes, which makes both skirmish, network and multiplayer games a lot more fun to play. Multiplayer is primarily played through the CnCNet. In addition, each faction has an extensive list of unique soundtracks, composed by Frank Klepacki, Black Ice 9 and World Beyond.\r\n\r\nMental Omega APYR is in version 3.3.6 as of October 30, 2021.\r\n\r\nh4.
