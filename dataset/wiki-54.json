The Producer recruits Shuuko from her old job of waiting tables. She initially stayed in the office, but she moves out as her career gets better. She has very pale skin, which is likely a result of her 'hobby' of donating blood in order to scrounge up money to live on. In her base card forms, she is usually seen snacking.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Shuuko is shown to move at her own pace. She admits that she can’t be as sexy as [[Nitta Minami]], and wants to believe that she is more of a night life person. While she can be lazy, she is normally active during the daytime. Shuuko says she cannot swim, although [[Koshimizu Sachiko]] is dubious of this.\r\n\r\nDue to her popularity, she was selected for the 8th CINDERELLA MASTER CD series, alongside [[Tachibana Arisu]], [[Ichinose Shiki]], [[Katagiri Sanae]], and [[Sakurai Momoka]].

The group emerged in the late 1980s and is often credited with popularizing gangsta rap, a subgenre of hip-hop characterized by its gritty and often explicit lyrics that depicted the realities of urban life, especially within African-American communities.\r\n\r\nThe most notable members of N.W.A included [i]\"Eazy-E\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazy-E[/i], [i]\"Dr. Dre\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre[/i], [i]\"Ice Cube\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube[/i], [i]\"MC Ren\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Ren[/i], and [i]\"DJ Yella\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Yella[/i]. The group's music was known for its explicit content, raw social commentary, and unapologetic portrayal of life in Compton.\r\n\r\nTheir debut album, '[[Straight Outta Compton]],' released in 1988, is one of the most significant albums in hip-hop history. The album featured tracks like  [i]\"'Fuck tha Police'\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_tha_Police[/i] that addressed issues of [[police]] brutality and racial profiling. The album's controversial content led to it being banned by many radio stations and retailers, but it also gained a strong underground following, spreading through word-of-mouth.\r\n\r\nWhile N.W.A disbanded in the early 1990s due to internal conflicts and creative differences, their legacy remains influential in hip-hop and popular culture. The group's members also went on to have successful solo careers in music, film, and other entertainment industries. \r\n\r\nThe group's story was depicted in the 2015 biographical film [i]\"'Straight Outta Compton'\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Outta_Compton_(film)[/i]\r\n\r\nh4.

It is used in the [[coat of arms]]/[[logo]] of many governmental branches.\r\n\r\nIt consists of three three-peaked crowns in an equilateral triangle, with two on top and one in the bottom. The most common shape of the insignia is that of a shield, but the air force uses a round version on their vehicles, in which case there is a border in the same colour as the crowns. In its base form, the crowns are yellow on a blue fill. On military vehicles colourless versions are often used, with black (or dark grey) crowns and border with no fill, which is used on bright surfaces, or a white fill with black or transparent crowns and no border, used on darker surfaces. Very old army vehicles can be seen in pictures and museums painted with a rectangular version of the insignia in the latter colour scheme. However, the rectangular insignia was eventually dropped in favour of painting the [[Swedish flag]] instead.\r\n\r\nh4.

It influenced many sci-fi anime creators and helped to create the [b]Real Robot[/b] genre of piloted [[mecha]] (The creators of [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] from 1979 have cited Starship Troopers as an important inspiration).\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual produced a 6 episode Japanese OVA adaptation locally titled [[Uchuu No Senshi]].\r\n\r\nThe most famous and well known adaptation of the book is the 1997 movie adaptation directed by Paul Verhoeven and staring Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and Neil Patrick Harris. The movie has a mixed reception since some criticized Verhoeven as he never fully read the book and thought the books themes of militarism and patriotism was more like Fascism and portray the human government in the book as Fascists while other praises the movie as a satire of Nationalism and Military Propaganda.\r\n\r\nh4.

The aircraft was built for speed, with retractable stabilizing floats in the wings and the ability to jettison the central main float in an emergency, but neither the retractable floats nor the main float jettison system worked reliably in practice. The aircraft also suffered from significant mechanical unreliability and high maintenance needs.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the planned use of the [i]Ooyodo[/i] class was abandoned and the [[Ooyodo (Kancolle)|single completed ship of the class]] was refitted as a command cruiser for surface formations instead.  Only 15 E15Ks were produced, and none was ever carried by [[Ooyodo (Kancolle)|Ooyodo]].  Even so, some [i][[Kantai Collection]][/i] fan artists depict her with them instead of the [[Aichi E13A]] scout seaplanes she actually carried.\r\n\r\nCalled [b][i]Shiun[/i][/b] (\"Violet Cloud\")  by the Japanese, the E15K had the Allied reporting name [b]Norm[/b]. \r\n\r\nh4.

She will do anything that she can to help others: this, alongside her unusual abilities, made her something of a savior for Daein and earned her the titles \"Silver-Haired Maiden\" and \"Priestess of Dawn\".

Like with Light Sage, she also has a cape, though in this case it is [[red cape|red]].\r\n\r\nIn Fire Emblem Cipher (and later Heroes) she has a fourth outfit, [[micaiah_(radiant_queen)_(fire_emblem)|Radiant Queen/Queen of Silver Shine]], which not only gave her a new color for a dress ([[black dress|black]]) is also gave her a [[red coat]]; like Light Priestess, it has a circlet (though with a more complicated design) and the bridal gauntlets.\r\n\r\nAlso from Heroes, she has appeared in some additional outfits; a [[micaiah (summer's dawn) (fire emblem)|butterfly-themed Yukata]], a [[micaiah_(bridal)_(fire_emblem)|wedding dress]] (alongside Sothe), a [[micaiah (wavecrest maiden) (fire emblem)|red bikini]], and a [[micaiah (ninja) (fire emblem)|ninja outfit]] (alongside Sanaki).\r\n\r\nVoiced in Radiant Dawn's cutscenes, [[Fire Emblem Heroes]] and [[Fire Emblem Engage]] by [[Kuwatani Natsuko]] in Japanese portrayals.
