Haramase! Honoo no Oppai Isekai Oppai Maid Gakuen!]]\r\n\r\nh4.Profile\r\nThe Masochist Valkyrie Oppai Maid!\r\nPhan De Minaj Maid Academy Third Year\r\nMaid Disciplinary Committee and Maid Hunting Club Member\r\n\r\n•Boobs: 120 cm ~「Master, please don't look up while licking them... Kufuuu♥」\r\n•Nipples: 6.2 mm (Length) ~「Are they too big? Will you tease them a lot!?」\r\n•Areolae: 36 mm (Diameter)~「The shape, the color... Don't fall in love with me!」\r\n•Waist: 59 cm ~「Don't forget to train until your body is tight!」\r\n•Hips: 92 cm ~「I'm a bit big... but that makes it easier to hit♥」\r\n•Thighs: 46 cm (Thickness) ~「Sexual harassment is prohibited! Ah, but.... if you give the order♥」\r\n•Vagina: 42.3 mm (Full Length) ~「You can store your sex sword here, Master♥」\r\n\r\nShe is a third-year student, a year older than the protagonist, and a Valkyrie girl who also serves as a member of the Discipline Committee. She has a well-trained and toned body and boasts Q-cup boobs.\r\n\r\nShe is a beautiful girl with a fine nose and eyes with a dignified atmosphere, which attracts the eyes of those around her. And she is also the head maid of the fellow maid group. As a Valkyrie, she should be strong in battle and in rough times, a dependable leader... But that is not the case at all. In fact, she is one of the most clumsy underachievers in the school, and her motivation and abilities are out of all proportion.\r\n\r\nShe is serious and straightforward, proud of her race, and has a strong sense of justice. Although she may sound like an excellent student, she is in fact a stupid girl, a waste-of-space Valkyrie that even her mother and teachers have a hard time wrapping their heads around. Basically, she is a girl who fails everything except subjects related to combat and physical education, and is a regular recipient of red marks. Moreover, she was happy for a while, thinking that a red mark was \"a good mark\". In addition, contrary to her appearance, she is sensitive to being dominated, and is aroused easily by anything. She sometimes orgasms in reaction to sneezing, and the protagonist compares her to an old man's urine leakage. Although she has many problems, she has a strong sense of camaraderie and is willing to put herself on the line to protect her friends, so she is well trusted by those around her. She is often teased by others, but often does not even realize she is being teased, which is a pity.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \"Maid Hunting Club\". The maids of Yggdrasil fight monsters to protect their masters, so the hunting club has a large presence in the school. Kriemhild, who is not very good at classroom learning but is at the top of her class when it comes to combat, is the captain of the club as well.\r\n\r\nHer mother, Brynhildr, is also a Valkyrie, and is the captain of the Valkyrie unit which also includes the head of the school's security force. Kriemhild respects her mother more than anyone else, and they get along well, but her daughter's lack of ability makes her give up on her. However, she is trying to put her body on the line in the hope that the long-awaited master from another world will do something about it (in more ways than one).","is_locked":false,"other_names":["クリムヒルデ・ヴァルハンナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":230836,"created_at":"2025-03-11T13:58:55.815-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-23T07:44:56.729-04:00","title":"fran_franchir","body":"A female character from [[Motto!

While computers are getting better at image recognition, CAPTCHAs can still be designed to be challenging enough for bots.\r\n* Audio Challenges: Presenting audio clips of words or numbers that are distorted or have background noise. This is helpful for visually impaired users and still difficult for automated audio analysis.\r\n* Mathematical Problems: Asking users to solve simple arithmetic problems.\r\n* Logic Puzzles: Presenting simple logic or reasoning puzzles.\r\n\r\n The most popular one is reCAPTCHA, owned by [[Google]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It was the largest escalation of the [[Vietnam War]] to date, and was timed to coincide with (and thus named for) the traditional Vietnamese Tet lunar new year at the end of January, 1968. In the early morning of 30 January 1968, attacks began against hundreds of towns and cities all across South Vietnam. \r\n\r\nThe Tet Offensive was a catastrophic military failure. Contrary to communist expectations, ARVN forces fought fiercely and repelled most of the attacks on their own, and South Vietnam's international allies were able to redeploy to assist faster than the North Vietnamese expected. The NLF engaged in open warfare for the first time since 1965 and were all but wiped out. Despite brutal fighting in the capital Saigon and city of Hue, the Tet Offensive was unable to accomplish any of their military goals. \r\n\r\nThis fate was opposite, however, in the political sphere. The American public had been told by their leaders for months that the North Vietnamese were on the edge of defeat and incapable of launching an offensive of any kind. Public trust in their leader's ability to prosecute the war plummeted. As opposed to the [[Battle of Hamburger Hill]], which entered public consciousness for its seeming waste, Tet is known in public consciousness as the point when Western governments could no longer deny that they were losing in Vietnam. \r\n\r\nh4.
