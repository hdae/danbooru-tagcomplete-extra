It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. \r\n\r\nCuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of 109,884 square kilometres (42,426 sq mi), and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. Its official language is [[spanish_text|Spanish]].\r\n\r\nUntil the 15th century, it was inhabited by Amerindian tribes which became a colony of [[Spain]] until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952.\r\n\r\nFurther unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established [[communism|communist]] rule under the leadership of [[Fidel Castro]].\r\n\r\nSince 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. A point of contention during the [[Cold War]] between the [[soviet|Soviet Union]] and the [[united states|United States]], a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Cuba is one of the few remaining Marxist–Leninist socialist states.\r\n\r\nCulturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\r\n\r\nh4.

As Reisen, she has [[swept bangs]] and a single bent ear, often [[breathing fire]] from a random one-shot joke in 2015. She is still active as a [[virtual youtuber]].\r\n\r\nShe was initially the least popular character of Cookie☆☆ S3, with almost no fan art or MADs. However in 2016, a single user by the name of [[Ants (cookie)|]] began posting MAD ranking videos as if she was a popular character like [[Majime-kun]]. Other users began ironically making MADs starring Hisui, which would then get added into Ants's rankings, which would then cause more people to watch them. This began the \"Unprecedented HSI姉貴 Boom\" where derivative characters with almost no connection to anything Hisui herself ever did were made. \r\n\r\nThis rapid escalation also caused a number of running jokes. One that carried over from Reisen is fake or detachable ears, except that Hisui's aren't and ends with her comedically spewing blood everywhere.

His MADs were all extremely high quality no matter the subject, mixing Cookie with everything from Jojo to Undertale. Created CTV, later handing it off to [[AaliyahRaylenard]]. He attracted a huge amount of fans and haters, as others were jealous of his rapid rise. This was compounded when he became a director of Cookie's most shitposty voice dramas, and people began accusing him of making his own MAD material. A rumor that he was a wanted [[karasawa_takahiro|HaseKara]] member began to spread, and on December 5th 2018 he was completely doxxed not by Cookie fans but by the HaseKara community. His name, age, photo, home address, university, and arrest for producing [[LSD]], and he changed his account names to \"Cemetery\" and disappeared.

It featured new semi-3D graphics, a more futuristic [[science fiction]] setting, and new gameplay features such as vehicles capable of hovering or burrowing. \r\n\r\nThe main story of the game focuses on a second war between the UN-backed [[Global Defense Initiative]] (GDI) and the cult-like [[Brotherhood of Nod]], both seeking to rule over an [[earth_(planet)|Earth]] which is undergoing rapid ecological collapse.\r\n\r\nTiberian Sun was one of the most anticipated games of 1999. Its development suffered numerous delays, with several features being cut before release. However, it was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics, despite some of the technical bugs in the game. The dark atmosphere, foreboding soundtrack, and slow paced gameplay of Tiberian Sun received a mixed reception from fans upon release, although have earned it a cult following since. Its story of a military-industrial complex preoccupied with [[terrorism]] rather than environmental failure has been hailed as a metaphor for modern times. \r\n\r\nSeveral additional features were added to the game with the Firestorm expansion pack, including new units and a multiplayer global war mode.

Other modes include a skirmish battle mode and multiplayer games.\r\n\r\nThe game received favorable reviews, and proved a commercial success following its launch, with a stand-alone expansion pack released a year later on March 24, 2008, titled Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":171103,"created_at":"2023-08-22T01:36:56.566-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-21T04:46:31.300-04:00","title":"command_&_conquer:_generals","body":"A real-time strategy video game developed by [[electronic_arts|EA Pacific]] and released in February 2003. \r\n\r\nIt is set in the near future, relative to the game's release date, using technology that is either existent, in development, or theorized. The game features a conflict between the [[global_liberation_army|Global Liberation Army]] (GLA), an organization resembling a [[terrorist]] group, and the superpowers of the [[China|People’s Republic of China]] (China) and the [[united_states|United States of America]] (USA). \r\n\r\nThe game operates in a similar manner to other titles in the [[Command and Conquer|Command & Conquer]] series, where players construct bases, train units, acquire resources on one of the game's maps to fund their operations, and then defeat their opponents by eliminating their bases and armies. It is the first Command & Conquer RTS game to use 3D graphics in-game. The game takes place in an entirely separate continuity that is completely unrelated to the [[command & conquer: red alert 2|Red Alert]] universe or the [[Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun|Tiberium]] universe.\r\n\r\nAn expansion pack titled [i]\"Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_&_Conquer:_Generals_%E2%80%93_Zero_Hour][/i] was released in September 2003, adding several new abilities and units to each side, and a new mode of play called Generals' Challenge, along with a lot more changes, new features and bug/glitch fixes.\r\n\r\nThe series has received controversy from media watchdogs due to its national stereotyping and the ability to play as a terrorist-like organization, particularly during the height of the \"War on Terror\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror. Longtime Command & Conquer fans also objected to the association of their franchise with a game that resembled other real-time strategy games more than traditional Command & Conquer gameplay. \r\n\r\nDespite this, the game received positive reviews from fans and critics for its solid and action-packed gameplay, as well as receiving praise for the humorous and memorable voicelines for many of its units. It has since gained a cult following, with fans of the series continuing to develop mods that change the gameplay significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. See Also\r\n* [[Command and Conquer]]\r\n\r\nh4.
