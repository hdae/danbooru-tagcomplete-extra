This version of her is still quite physically similar to her former self, sporting a new [[sailor collar]] as part of her upper outfit, an anchor [[brooch]], the removal of her arm mounted turret, a pair of light blue see through [[bangle]]s and another two similar pieces of jewelry adorning her twin tails representing the installation of a \"Pugliese Torpedo Defense System\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littorio-class_battleship#Pugliese_torpedo_defense_system].\r\n\r\nAs part of the \"Children's Day 2016\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Day] update an [[official alternate costume]] (post #2399989) was made available featuring a [[aged down]] version of Andrea in a [[shirt]] with [[puffy short sleeves]], clutching a [[book]], larger hair ribbons and a bandaid in the location where her amidships turret used to be.\r\n\r\nh4. Personality\r\nAndrea is a thoroughbred [[tsundere]], initially disappointed with the player on acquisition, only really opening up with her remodeled version. Due to her similarities of both personalities and looks with [[Akizuki Airi]] she earned the nicknames \"Airi\" and \"Daughter\" among players and memed so hard among the community it effected the reveal and design of her sister ship [[caio duilio (warship girls r)|Caio Duilio]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Her ship funnels and a mast flying the [[white ensign]] are mounted behind her.\r\n\r\nOn August 29th, Hood's remodeled artwork (post #2401044) was revealed as part of the Project R trailer and her remodel was released with patch 2.0 in early November. This version of Hood's hair ornament changes color to purple, her military uniform's base colors change to white with blue cuffs and capelet. Her footwear now features a blue cross shaped pattern with a [[union jack]] on her right leg. \r\n\r\nThe machinery is also updated to include two red and white armor plates mounted forward to protect her legs and thighs, the addition of a pair of twin 4-inch turrets and a pair of British 2 Pounder 8 Barrel \"Pom-Pom\" anti-air guns mounted to her rear. The mast is replaced with the ship's spotting top featuring type 284 gunnery radar.\r\n\r\nHood is depicted as a well-spoken, serene woman, exemplifying true British values such as sipping tea, staying calm and carrying on. Her bad eyesight is accredited to HMS Hood's inability to discern the difference between Prinz Eugene and Bismarck during the opening phases of the Battle of Denmark Strait.

There are several additional turrets of double 6-inch guns located on the inner ring of the machinery as a secondary armament with a mast and crane in the back. \r\n\r\nRodney received a remodel early in the game's life. This version of Rodney sees her entire outfit swap colors with red replacing blue and blue replacing red. The plumage on her bicorne increases with new white plumage mixed into the fray. There's an additional white sash draping down from her left shoulder with golden trim added to almost all pieces of clothing. White [[garter straps]] are also made visible.\r\n\r\nThe machinery is augmented with a green and blue camouflage paint scheme. The main turrets and the rear section of the machinery mounts multiple single 20mm Oerlikon cannons and a single 2 Pounder 8 Barrel \"Pom-Pom\" anti-air gun. On one turret a Supermarine Walrus rests on a seaplane catapult. The inner ring of equipment is removed with three of the four 6-inch turrets now located on the more ship like designed stern, better representing how these secondary batteries were positioned.

This seasonal CG, a Christmas-themed one, shows her wearing a [[red dress]] with a [[corset]], a [[white skirt|white]] pleated skirt, a [[white capelet]], [[black gloves|black]] [[fingerless gloves]], a [[holly hair ornament]], black thighhighs, and [[fur-trimmed_boots|fur-trimmed]] [[black footwear|black]] [[boots]].

Unlike Japanese carriers, she carries no historical weapon representing aircraft launching, instead holding a small deck of two twin-[[cannon]] anti-air [[ship turret|turrets]] like a pistol. Her hull also has twin-cannon turrets. Her carrier deck is carried on a robotic swing arm from the back of the hull that is attached to her back on a metal girdle.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\nThe historic Graf Zeppelin was also notable for incorporating design flaws the other major powers had already learned to avoid. Graf Zeppelin's surface armament was 16 single-purpose 15 cm guns in 8 twin-mount casemates, at a time when other countries were arming their carriers with smaller dual-purpose guns to increase their anti-air coverage. These guns were of heavy cruiser size, numbered more than a heavy cruiser would carry for \"commerce raiding operations\" and would have required the carrier to come into direct surface engagement range to actually use. This was in fact the result of miscommunication with the ship's designer, who intended to save weight by using 4 twin-mount instead of 8 single-mount casemates; the builders thought that he was instead telling them to double the total number of guns. In game, though, this trait is the reason she's able to attack during night battles, the first night carrier in the game (though not night airstrike combat-capable).\r\n\r\nh4.

To her sides, at thigh-level, are cutoff-ship-deck-like platforms that bear a single-[[cannon]] [[ship turret|turret]]. She also carries a single-cannon turret in her left hand like a pistol, which is modeled like a ship's bow bearing the number \"5\". \r\n\r\nh4. Personality\r\n\r\nAsakaze has an energetic personality, proud of her accomplishments but also highly sensitive to criticism. Her in-game lines include several instances of indignation over perceptions of anyone \"making fun of her\" even when none existed. Possibly because of the meaning her name, she also seems to love mornings, getting up at 4 AM to see the sunrise. Inversely, she becomes notably more nervous at night, likely due to the circumstances of her sinking.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nOriginally commissioned merely as \"Destroyer No. 3\" as part of the \"8-8 Fleet Program,\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-eight_fleet the name [i]Asakaze[/i] was only assigned in 1928, five years after launch. At the time of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, [i]Asakaze[/i] was part of Destroyer Division 5, alongside sister-ships [i][[harukaze (kancolle)|Harukaze]][/i], [i]Matsukaze[/i], and [i]Hatakaze[/i].\r\n\r\nAlready aging by the start of the war, Asakaze mostly escorted landing craft in campaigns like \"the Philippines\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_Campaign_(1941%E2%80%9342)], \"Java\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Java], and \"Andaman Islands\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_and_occupation_of_the_Andaman_Islands_during_World_War_II]. At the \"Battle of Sunda Straight\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sunda_Strait], [i]Asakaze[/i] launched torpedoes that assisted in the sinking of HMAS [i]Perth[/i] and USS [i]Houston[/i].\r\n\r\nThroughout most of the rest of the war, she was a convoy escort ship. [i]Asakaze[/i] was torpedoed by the submarine USS [i]Haddo[/i] at 22:35 on August 23rd near Luzon while on escort duty. During the night, efforts to save her proved unsuccessful, and in the pre-dawn hours of August 24th, she capsized and sank. \r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nAlthough she was the second of the nine Kamikaze-class destroyers, due to IJN numbering at the time she was listed as \"Destroyer No. 3\" at launch due to sharing a number scheme with the \"Wakatake-class destroyers\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakatake-class_destroyer].\r\n\r\nHer seiyuu is [[Itou Shizuka]].\r\n\r\nh4.

The ensemble cast includes Jane Kaczmarek and [[Bryan Cranston]] as Malcolm's parents, Lois and Hal. Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Justin Berfield, and Erik Per Sullivan appear as Malcolm's brothers, Francis, Reese, and Dewey, respectively. Typical plots revolve around the family's dysfunctional relationships and inability to fit into society, with Malcolm regularly making asides to the camera to comment on their failures. Another brother, Jamie (James and Lukas Rodriguez), was introduced as the fifth son of Hal and Lois at the end of season four.

Israel accused Hamas of indiscriminately killings civilians in order to justify a full scale invasion of the Gaza Strip to \"neutralize Hamas once and for all\".\r\n\r\nThe war quickly devolved into a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip by the [[Israel Defense Forces]], with multiple cases of scorched earth tactics used by the IDF, levelling Palestinian settlements and starving the population (a charge Israel denies, often claiming their attacks are \"precision strikes\" against Hamas), along with various claims and evidence of atrocities committed by the IDF. This led to call for ceasefire and support for Palestine around the world.\r\n\r\nThe war has also spilled over into various other Middle Eastern countries, particularly countries under the influence of [[Iran]] such as [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and the Houthi-controlled areas of [[Yemen]], while Israel receives military and political support from the [[United States]] and NATO, which led some analysts to consider the war a proxy conflict between the US and Iran.\r\n\r\nThe conflict has brought the overall Israel-Palestine conflict into the public forefront, and has been a divisive topic that has been both defended and condemned to the most extreme extent. Supporters of Palestine often condemn the war as an example of \"continued European colonization\" and of genocidal oppression, while supporters of Israel argue that Israel has the right to \"defend themselves\" against hostile forces, regardless of the ways in which this is achieved.\r\n\r\nh4.

He then became sick and nearly died on his way to Tatooine but survived thanks to Ahsoka Tano. After Anakin Skywalker and Tano evaded Dooku, who tried to kill Rotta and blame the Jedi, Rotta was returned to his father. Rotta was later present when Baron Notluwiski Papanoida visited Jabba's Palace. In 20 BBY, Ventress returned to [[Tatooine]], and wished to avoid attention from Jabba as she had previously kidnapped his son.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":107129,"created_at":"2019-07-10T12:17:18.903-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-23T08:49:59.749-05:00","title":"fenyon","body":"One of the many current [[Dragon Ball]] promo artists and the official artist for the HD-2D remake of [[Dragon Quest III]].\r\n\r\nName derived from the French word \"fainéant\", meaning slacker or lazybones.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":202578,"created_at":"2024-08-06T06:58:50.298-04:00","updated_at":"2024-11-23T08:37:25.650-05:00","title":"shorekeeper_(wuthering_waves)","body":"Playable character in [[Wuthering Waves]].\r\n\r\nLeader of the Black Shores, a research organization that has developed a Lament (disaster) prediction system.

Joe[/i][/b] is a famous and classic line of [[military]] [[action figure]]s produced and owned by the [[Hasbro]] American toy company. \r\n\r\n\"G.I.\" ([i]Government Issue[/i]) is a generic term for U.S. soldiers. The development of the first G.I. Joe toy led to the coining of the term \"action figure\". G.I. Joe's appeal to children has made it an American icon among toys. The action figure line has also become famous in many different countries across the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe G.I. Joe trademark has been used by Hasbro to title two different toy lines. \r\n\r\nThe original 12-inch (30 cm) line that began in 1964 centered on realistic action figures. In the United Kingdom, this line was licensed to Palitoy and known as [i]Action Man[/i]. \r\n\r\nThe initial product offering represented four of the branches of the U.S. armed forces with the Action Soldier (U.S. Army), Action Sailor (U.S. Navy), Action Pilot (USAF), Action Marine (USMC) and later on, the Action Nurse. \r\n\r\nThen in 1982, the line was relaunched in a much smaller 3.75-inch (9.5 cm) scale complete with new futuristic vehicles, detailed playsets, and a complex and rich background story involving an ongoing struggle between the [i]G.I. Joe [/i] team and the evil [[Cobra Command]] organization which seeks to take over the Free World through [[terrorism]] and using advanced and sophisticated weaponry. \r\n\r\nThe new 80s line was initially intended as a means to sell the new toy vehicles, but over time the unique characters and their different and detailed action figures became much more popular and extremely sought after to this day.\r\n\r\nThe 1982 toy line became extremely successful and was also supported by two animated series as well as a major [[comic]] series published initially by [[Marvel]] Comics which expanded each character's background and mythos which were mostly developed by Marvel writer/artist \"Larry Hama\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hama .\r\n\r\nh4.
