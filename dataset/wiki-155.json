Completed in October 31st of 1942, and was sunk by the submarine [i]USS Skate[/i] on February 16th 1944 while heading to Japan from Truk to receive repairs from damage in the Solomons campaign.  \r\n\r\nThey were among the last light cruisers the IJN ever developed, and were heavier than most light cruisers, but were consequently under-armed and under-armored for their weight, as the IJN did not increase those capabilities as much as the mass.  The Agano class was characteristic for having only a single [[smokestack]], as the light cruiser design was re-evaluated to have less clutter on the decks, be less overweight for its hull, and hence, have better stability in open seas.\r\n\r\nIn real life, Agano and her sisters were to have replaced the aging [i]Tenryuu[/i], [i]Kuma[/i], and [i]Nagara[/i] classes of light cruisers as destroyer squadron and submarine squadron flagships. Only her sisters Noshiro and Yahagi were able to fulfill that said role, however.\r\nShe was completed in mid-1942 and thrown into the front lines of the Guadalcanal and Solomons campaigns, eventually seeing action in the battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 2 November 1943. Just a few days later, she sustained severe damage from an air attack by US carriers and was forced to withdraw to Truk.\r\n\r\nNot fully repaired, she was again attacked by US naval forces in Truk on February 1944 and sunk while retreating to Japan, with the destroyer Oite rescuing more than 500 survivors. The next day, Oite herself was sunk with all of the Agano survivors. \r\n\r\nh4.See Also:\r\n* [[Agano (Kancolle)]]\r\n* [[Agano (Azur Lane)]]\r\n* \"Wikipedia: IJN [i]Agano[/i]\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Agano]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":144260,"created_at":"2022-05-25T04:44:58.679-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T23:54:16.449-04:00","title":"scorch_mark","body":"Burn marks on an object or scenery.\r\n\r\nSee [[burn scar]] for when a character has burn scars.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["scorch_marks","scorched_mark","scorched_marks"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145756,"created_at":"2022-06-22T23:23:51.846-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T23:23:51.846-04:00","title":"cor_leonis","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["コル・リオニス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145755,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:51:07.983-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:51:07.983-04:00","title":"taishakuten_(housamo)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["タイシャクテン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145754,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:35:53.135-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:35:53.135-04:00","title":"hachisuke","body":"Hachisuke, also known as [b]Hu-Bee[/b], is the mascot of the video game developer company [[Hudson]], who also appears on the company's logo.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ハチ助"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145753,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:20:38.185-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:20:38.185-04:00","title":"asakura_miyuko","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["浅倉美由子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145752,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:19:15.264-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:19:15.264-04:00","title":"asakura_tokiori","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["浅倉時織"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145749,"created_at":"2022-06-22T22:12:46.977-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-22T22:15:45.465-04:00","title":"sorrowchat_(vocaloid)","body":"A [[vocaloid]] song by MIMI featuring [[Hatsune Miku]].\r\n\r\n\"YouTube\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5xaccIl1Ps\r\n\"Niconico\":https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm37839425\r\n\r\nh4.

Adon also appears in [[street_fighter_iv_(series)|Super Street Fighter IV]].\r\n\r\nAdon became [[sagat|Sagat's]] student three years after Sagat became God of Muay Thai. Frequently likened to a \"lesser version of Sagat\", even though he has strived to differentiate himself with more acrobatic techniques, Adon enters the first World Warrior tournament to prove he is more than that. The cocky Adon lets his guard down when he faces [[ryu (street fighter)|Ryu]], who takes him out with a single [[Shouryuuken]]. Afterwards, Ryu goes on to defeat Sagat, which leads to Adon's eventual breakdown. \r\n\r\nAdon is not mad at Ryu for defeating him, he is mad at Sagat for being unable to uphold Muay Thai's honor (conveniently forgetting how Ryu had bested him during the World Warrior tournament). He challenges Sagat for the title of God of Muay Thai and wins, but the enraged Sagat does so much damage to him in the fight that Adon has to be hospitalized for months. Adon's injuries eventually heal and a new fighter captivates his attention. Rumor reaches his ears of a fighter who has mastered the power that had enabled Ryu to win the first World Warrior Tournament. This fighter kills a man who was about to challenge Adon for his title.

Aiming for higher penetration, flatter trajectory, and more damage, the Italians would ultimately come to the 7.35x51mm Carcano cartridge. This cartridge featured a Spitzer-style projectile instead of the 6.5 Carcano's round-nosed projectile. Using the same en-bloc clip-fed bolt-action design of the M91 Carcano, other notable changes in the M38 were cutting overall length by over ten inches and fixing the rear sights at a 200 meter distance, believing this would the average engagement distance in modern warfare.\r\n\r\nDespite this ambition, the switch to 7.35 Carcano would become to strenuous and costly on logistics. Another issue included the Italian military's decision to chop the barrel of existing M1891s into M38s, ignoring how the old twist rate would affect the accuracy of the rifle with the newer, hotter ammunition, proving a detriment to a number of the rifles' accuracy. By mid 1940 the military would revert back to 6.5 Carcano, rebarreling most M38s with the few remaining 7.35 Carcano rifles relegated to auxiliary troops and paramilitary organizations. Under the new M91/38s designation, the rifle would continue production in Italy's earlier caliber of choice.\r\n\r\nThe M38 Carcano would serve as the backbone of the Italian army for much of World War II, though they weren’t shy about offering them to allies. Finland would accept many during the Winter War against the Soviet Union. Germany’s Afrika Corps would procure some M38s for themselves, rechambering them for 7.92x57mm Mauser. They would see combat throughout the Mediterranean and Eastern Fronts. Following the ousting of Benito Mussolini in 1943, some Italian troops in areas such as Greece and Yugoslavia would join the rebel troops and fight off the Germans. Since the end of World War II, these rifles have found their way into the hands of rebels and insurgents alike, seen most recently in conflicts such as the Libyan Civil War.\r\n\r\nSince the end of the War, the Carcano has been a popular choice on the consumer market, particularly with hunting. With the short length, light weight, and the ability to mount an aftermarket scope on the rifle it was common to see it in the hands of hunters in the following decades alongside other wartime rifles.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145570,"created_at":"2022-06-19T07:14:02.878-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-19T07:14:02.878-04:00","title":"darpa_xm-3","body":"The DARPA XM-3 was an improved variant of the M40A3 sniper rifle designed by DARPA in collaboration with Iron Brigade Armory Ltd. in 2005 and built by the Marine Corps Precision Weapons Shop in 2006.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145569,"created_at":"2022-06-19T06:48:01.120-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-19T06:48:01.120-04:00","title":"kubikiri_(kubikiri)","body":"Often draw [[guro]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145567,"created_at":"2022-06-19T02:54:43.958-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-19T02:54:43.958-04:00","title":"caiyun","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["彩雲"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":145563,"created_at":"2022-06-19T02:32:22.399-04:00","updated_at":"2022-06-19T02:32:22.399-04:00","title":"mgl","body":"The MGL is a multiple-shot weapon, intended to significantly increase a small squad's firepower when compared to traditional single-shot grenade launchers like the M203.
