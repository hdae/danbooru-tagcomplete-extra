Her precise and quick directions allowed the fleet to release deadly barrage to any enemy. She is also well known for her powerful swordplay. Despite her small body, she wields swords almost as big as herself with incredible strength. With her signature hookshot, she can even throw ogres around.\r\n\r\nShe may look aloof and cold, but that doesn't mean she lacks passion.

May 1988 in Moscow. \r\nSergei Georgievich Gorshkov was born in 1910 as the son of a teacher. In 1927 he entered the Soviet Navy and initially studied physics and mathematics in Leningrad , where he also graduated from the Frunze Naval College , before serving as an officer from 1931, first in the Black Sea Fleet and then in the Pacific Fleet .\r\n\r\nWhen the Great Patriotic War broke out in 1941, he commanded the Azov flotilla as rear admiral . In the course of this activity he also got to know Leonid Brezhnev , who later became head of state and party of the Soviet Union , who reported in his memoirs that his unit had been rescued from the German encirclement by Gorshkov's ships. Gorshkov later commanded the Danube flotilla until he lost his command due to differences of opinion with the Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Ukrainian Front , Marshal Fyodor Tolbuchin .\r\n\r\nUnder Nikita Khrushchev , Gorshkov rose to First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy in 1955, then in January 1956 he was appointed successor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Nikolai Gerassimowitsch Kuznetsov , and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Gorshkov, who had joined the Communist Party in 1942 , was elected a candidate for the Central Committee of the CPSU , and in 1961 was finally elected a full member of the Central Committee. In 1967 he was promoted to Fleet Admiral of the Soviet Union, the maritime equivalent of Marshal of the Soviet Union .\r\n\r\nAs Commander in Chief, he was able to convince Khrushchev of the need to convert the Soviet Navy from a coastal defense to a “global” fleet that would be able to assert Soviet interests worldwide. By 1985, among other things, the defense budget of the Soviet Union had inflated to 40% of the total budget, which led Mikhail Gorbachev to fire Gorshkov and replace him with Admiral Vladimir Chernavin , who had served as chief of staff since 1982.\r\n\r\nGorshkov died on May 13, 1988 in Moscow.\r\n\r\nBecause of his commitment, Gorshkov was seen as the \"father of the Soviet nuclear submarines\" or the \"father of the Soviet deep-sea fleet\", whose meaning equals a \" Mahan of the Soviet Union\".","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123315,"created_at":"2021-04-14T09:04:47.329-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T09:04:47.329-04:00","title":"sakonji_biwako","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["左近司琵琶子"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123314,"created_at":"2021-04-14T06:50:37.028-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T06:50:37.028-04:00","title":"hitachi_chigusa","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ヒタチ・千草"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123309,"created_at":"2021-04-14T05:47:21.389-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T05:48:27.767-04:00","title":"food_with_face","body":"[[Food]] purposefully drawn to have a face: with eyes at minimum, and often a mouth.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":123307,"created_at":"2021-04-14T02:42:43.416-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T02:44:42.624-04:00","title":"akazukin","body":"Japanese for [[Little Red Riding Hood]] (or more literally, 'Red Hood.')\r\nAmbiguous tag due to the many stories and characters based on the original fairy tale.\r\n\r\n* For potential characters named Akazukin: \"akazukin_*\":/tags?commit=Search&search%5Bcategory%5D=4&search%5Bhide_empty%5D=yes&search%5Bname_or_alias_matches%5D=akazukin_%2A&search%5Border%5D=date | \"*_akazukin\":/tags?commit=Search&search%5Bcategory%5D=4&search%5Bhide_empty%5D=yes&search%5Bname_or_alias_matches%5D=%2A_akazukin&search%5Border%5D=date\r\n* For potential artists named Akazukin: \"akazukin_*\":/tags?commit=Search&search%5Bcategory%5D=1&search%5Bhide_empty%5D=yes&search%5Bname_or_alias_matches%5D=akazukin_%2A&search%5Border%5D=date | \"*_akazukin\":/tags?commit=Search&search%5Bcategory%5D=1&search%5Bhide_empty%5D=yes&search%5Bname_or_alias_matches%5D=%2A_akazukin&search%5Border%5D=date\r\n* For potential copyrights named Akazukin: \"akazukin_*\":/tags?commit=Search&search%5Bcategory%5D=3&search%5Bhide_empty%5D=yes&search%5Bname_or_alias_matches%5D=akazukin_%2A&search%5Border%5D=date | \"*_akazukin\":/tags?commit=Search&search%5Bcategory%5D=3&search%5Bhide_empty%5D=yes&search%5Bname_or_alias_matches%5D=%2A_akazukin&search%5Border%5D=date","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":33694,"created_at":"2012-03-31T19:09:48.895-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-14T00:29:53.999-04:00","title":"super_love_lotion","body":"The end theme of Toei's [[Tokimeki Tonight]], the closing sequence of which features main character [[Etou Ranze]] posing and sashaying while wearing only a [[cape]].

The unnatural left-over unpainted areas and each parts of the face that were drawn well, that stated \"These are just a joke by someone who is actually good at art\" versus \"These are simply the crappy art of someone who can't draw well\", which led to the unfolding of a lively debate on a certain online boards.
