It eventually turned into something like a microcosm of Umamusume, Horse Racing in general and general Internet memery, courtesy of the various anons at [[Futaba Channel]]. A lot of the content consists of short videos with limited animation, usually with the character flailing their limbs on their back (the Jitabata or \"flailing\" animation) or, more frequently, imitating [[Kakushin-Teki Metamorphose!|the Komaru dance]].\r\n\r\nMuch of the content depict the horse girls with exaggerated personalities and traits, or warped personalities (i.e. [[Special Week (umamusume)|]] turning into a deadbeat father with gambling issues, squandering her daughter [[Buena Vista (umamusume)|Buena]] [[Buena Vista (old Design) (umamusume)|Vista]]'s earnings in failed bets; anything involving [[Rice Shower (umamusume)|Zakkoku]]...). They aren't limited to the official characters, unmade or not and those original characters can be surprisingly well fleshed out for what should be glorified shitposts. In time, those original characters eventually outnumbered the official characters by a large margin.\r\n\r\nThis tag should be used whenever the artstyle is used or reproduced (character is drawn like Shombori Rudolf, character does the Jitabata animation or the Umaru Dance...), whenever it refers to a particular video or when a [i]unique[/i] character design for a original character from those videos is used.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["たぬき(ウマ娘)","ションボリルドルフ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129498,"created_at":"2021-10-21T01:36:29.753-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-25T19:28:37.171-04:00","title":"buena_vista_(old_design)_(umamusume)","body":"An [[Umamusume]] character.\r\n\r\nThis is the original design attributed to be Buena Vista, before she would be re-introduced with [[Buena Vista (umamusume)|a new design]] in 2024.\r\n\r\n* !asset #22842227","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ブエナビスタ(ウマ娘)","ブエナビスタ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":186273,"created_at":"2024-03-06T00:17:21.278-05:00","updated_at":"2024-09-25T19:28:24.933-04:00","title":"crazy_keiba_lady_(jra)","body":"A character appearing on a [[Japan Racing Association]] commercial promoting their merch mail-order website, [i]Turfy Mail Order Club[/i].\r\n\r\nThe Crazy Keiba Lady has [[long hair|long]] [[purple hair|purple]] hair with [[swept bangs|bangs sweeping]] to the left.

The Keiba Lady's catchphrase is \"As someone who likes racehorses...\", the first line she utters in the JRA commercial.\r\n\r\nBecause of her overenthusiastic passion for all things keiba (racehorses), as well as her blank-looking expression throughout the commercial, the Keiba Lady is known as the \"Yabee Onna\" or \"Crazy Dangerous Woman\" among the Japanese racehorse community. Fanart of her often portray her as a crazy overenthusiastic fan of [[Orfevre (racehorse)|]], and this has carried on over to his [[Orfevre (Umamusume)|Umamusume counterpart]] as well, especially in the [[Umamusume Tanuki]] series of fan videos. In fact, a character [[art_shift|art shifted]] to resemble her signifies that they have a similar love or obsession towards another character or subject, whatever it is in context.\r\n\r\nOfficial merch of the Keiba Lady is also sold, and can be found under the \"As Someone Who Likes Racehorses\" label.\r\n\r\nh5.

Translating 黄金旅程 into Japanese yields \"Kin'iro Ryotei\".\r\n\r\nDespite being a background character, Kin'iro Ryotei has gained some popularity among fan artists, as her implied namesake is the father of the real-life [[Gold Ship (racehorse)|]] and [[Orfevre (racehorse)|]] (the racehorse).

In a 2011 interview, he stated that Capcom does not have an official stance on Poison's gender, and it is left to the viewer's interpretation.\r\n\r\nh4.

Other than its titular character being recognized as a proposed design for the original [i]Ultraman[/i] TV series, the Redman character is also known by fans as a \"serial killer\" due to the nature of the show, which involves the hero beating up and killing the monster for no reason, sometimes in gruesome fashion.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["レッドマン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":74849,"created_at":"2016-04-24T12:09:37.559-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-24T21:55:01.352-04:00","title":"redman_(character)","body":"Titular character of the 1972 series [[Redman]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["レッドマン(キャラクター)","レッドマン","レッドファイッ!","レッドファイ!","赤い通り魔"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":204091,"created_at":"2024-08-17T01:27:10.566-04:00","updated_at":"2024-09-24T21:51:20.634-04:00","title":"ultra_fight","body":"A low-budget miniseries in the long-running [[Ultra Series]], concentrating solely on fighting with sports-style commentary. Initially consisting of only recycled footage, after 72 episodes, new, incredibly low budget fight scenes were made to fill out the remaining episodes, with [[Ultraseven]] and a handful of monsters fighting each other in outdoor locations with no special effects at all.\r\n\r\nThis was produced in-between [[Ultraseven (series)|]] and [[Kaette Kita Ultraman|Return of Ultraman]], in 1970, and helped generate interest for the latter before it released. Since then, \"Ultra Fight\" has been used as shorthand in spin-off and miniseries titles highlighting their lower budgets compared to main series entries. Of the non-Ultra shows inspired by it, [[Redman]] is the most famous.\r\n\r\nh4.

The group emerged in the late 1980s and is often credited with popularizing gangsta rap, a subgenre of hip-hop characterized by its gritty and often explicit lyrics that depicted the realities of urban life, especially within African-American communities.\r\n\r\nThe most notable members of N.W.A included [i]\"Eazy-E\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazy-E[/i], [i]\"Dr. Dre\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre[/i], [i]\"Ice Cube\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube[/i], [i]\"MC Ren\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Ren[/i], and [i]\"DJ Yella\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Yella[/i]. The group's music was known for its explicit content, raw social commentary, and unapologetic portrayal of life in Compton.\r\n\r\nTheir debut album, '[[Straight Outta Compton]],' released in 1988, is one of the most significant albums in hip-hop history. The album featured tracks like  [i]\"'Fuck tha Police'\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_tha_Police[/i] that addressed issues of [[police]] brutality and racial profiling. The album's controversial content led to it being banned by many radio stations and retailers, but it also gained a strong underground following, spreading through word-of-mouth.\r\n\r\nWhile N.W.A disbanded in the early 1990s due to internal conflicts and creative differences, their legacy remains influential in hip-hop and popular culture. The group's members also went on to have successful solo careers in music, film, and other entertainment industries. \r\n\r\nThe group's story was depicted in the 2015 biographical film [i]\"'Straight Outta Compton'\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Outta_Compton_(film)[/i]\r\n\r\nh4.
