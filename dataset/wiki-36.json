The film revisits the themes of fate, conscience, and circumstance that the Coen brothers had explored in the films Blood Simple (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), and Fargo (1996). The film follows three main characters: Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a Vietnam War veteran and welder who stumbles upon a large sum of money in the desert; Anton Chigurh (Bardem), a hitman who is sent to recover the money; and Ed Tom Bell (Jones), a sheriff investigating the crime.

In small amounts it can increase realism; in greater amounts it can create a sense of motion (similar to [[motion blur]]), convey a chaotic environment, or indicate anxiety, paranoia, or mental derangement.

The dance is called \"ｳｯｰｳｯｰｳﾏｳﾏ(ﾟ∀ﾟ) ([i]U-u-uma uma[/i])\" or \"ウマウマダンス ([i]Uma uma dance[/i])\" in Japan, spreading even further there following [[Exit Tunes]] obtaining the rights to the song from the original producers, releasing the original and sped-up remix to great success.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of posts under this tag reference the visual part of the flash, which comes from the opening animation of the Popotan game and has nothing to do with the Caramell song. Interestingly however, later on, Caramell (or rather their producers) did put out follow-up music videos of the song featuring anime/manga inspired personas, known as the [[Caramella Girls]], doing the dance, with the exact same tempo as the original edit.\r\n\r\nh4.

Her first appearance and the negative initial reactions coincided with the temporary suspension of the game's Twitter account that day, leading some Western fans to connect the perceived rage against Intrepid's design to the suspension (which was actually for unrelated reasons). In comparison, the Japanese fanbase was much more receptive for Intrepid's design with the initial negative reactions being lukewarm.\r\n\r\nh4.

Founding members \"Kim Gordon\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gordon (bass, vocals, guitar), \"Thurston Moore\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_Moore (lead guitar, vocals) and \"Lee Ranaldo\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ranaldo (rhythm guitar, vocals) remained together for the entire history of the band, while Steve Shelley (drums) followed a series of short-term drummers in 1985, rounding out the core line-up. Jim O'Rourke (bass, guitar, keyboards) was also a member of the band from 1999 to 2005, and Mark Ibold (bass, guitar) was a member from 2006 to 2011.\r\n\r\nSonic Youth originally emerged from the punk and experimental no wave art and music scene in New York before evolving into a more conventional rock band and becoming a prominent member of the American noise rock scene. \r\n\r\nThe band has been praised for having \"redefined what rock guitar could do\" using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings while preparing guitars with objects like drumsticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. They were a pivotal influence on the alternative and indie rock movements of the 80s, 90s and beyond.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through releases with SST Records in the late 1980s, the band experienced mainstream success throughout the 1990s and 2000s after signing to major label DGC in 1990 and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. \r\n\r\nSonic Youth disbanded in 2011 following the separation and subsequent divorce of Gordon and Moore, with their final live shows taking place in [[Brazil]]. The members have since asserted that the band is finished and will not reunite.\r\n\r\nh4.

Tall, fast, versatile, moderately armored, with a sloped glacis and a rounded turret housing a 75mm or 76mm gun, the reliable M4 saw worldwide use in both the Pacific (where it excelled) and the European theaters of the war.\r\n\r\nWhile the tank proved to be quite superior against the light armor used by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in the Pacific, the much heavier and potent tanks of the German [[Wehrmacht]] became very dangerous foes for the Sherman, which was even nicknamed \"The Tin Coffin\" or \"The Coffin on Tracks\" by American crews operating it in the European theater. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, its superior numbers and the fact that it was very easy to produce (in vast numbers), maintain, repair and modify (European crews eventually added extra armor and more potent anti-tank armament) proved crucial for the American war effort and made the Sherman tank a very successful combat machine design in the end.\r\n\r\nMore extensive modifications undertaken during the [[Cold War]] - specifically, the fitment of the [[AMX-13]]'s turret and gun on the M4 chassis by Egypt, and the addition of more powerful engines and a tweaked 105mm F1 gun taken from the [[AMX-30]] by Israel (the later receiving the designation of M-51 or Super Sherman) gave the old design a new lease of life decades after its retirement, proving the tank's capabilities could be expanded much further beyond its original specifications.\r\n\r\nh4.
