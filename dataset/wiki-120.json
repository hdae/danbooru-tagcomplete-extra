Written by [[Takahashi Kazuki]].\r\n\r\nThe series began its 224-episode run in Japan on April 18, 2000 and ended on September 29, 2004. In the United States, it began airing on September 29, 2001 and ended on June 10, 2006.\r\n\r\nAfter the positive reception following the release of the official card game by [[Konami]] in 1999, the series marked the point where it transitioned from a dark fantasy to almost exclusively revolving around the \"Duel Monsters\" card game. The series' \"Duelist Kingdom\" arc is also (in)famously known within the community for retaining the RPG-like elements from the early part of the manga, resulting in several unconventional uses of the cards (such as the notorious \"attack the moon\" scene and fusing a zombie monster to an opponent's monster and causing it to rot).\r\n\r\nh4.

Formerly a gunnery officer for the Erusean Navy up to the events of the [[ace_combat_04|Continental War]], he would earn the popular title as [i]The Hero of Comberth Harbor[/i] after he saved the crew of the \"ship he was assigned to\":[https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Tanager] during an air raid by [[isaf|ISAF]] air forces. Years later he would become the captain of an advanced submersible aviation cruiser named [[Alicorn (Ace Combat)|]], but the submarine accidentally ran aground and was missing for 698 days, eventually being found with most of its crew miraculously alive. During the events of the [[ace_combat_7|Lighthouse War]], the Erusean Navy didn't consider the submarine as part of their battle doctrine. After [[Trigger (Ace Combat)|]]'s squadron and another squadron destroyed much of Erusea's main fleet, it was hastily commissioned to plug the sudden defecit in naval power.\r\n\r\nHowever, Captain Matias Torres went rogue, determined to end the war in one fell swoop by nuking the Osean capital of Oured. Believing that he could save 10 million lives in Usea by claiming 1 million in Osea, Torres sailed the [i]Alicorn[/i] into firing position only to be intercepted by Trigger and an Osean surface action group. While the latter would be sunk by his vessel, Trigger would in turn score a killing blow against the vessel, the resulting catastrophic detonation killing Torres and his crew.\r\n\r\nHe was described by an [[david_north|weapons analyst]]: \"A devil incarnate.\" His bombastic delivery and insane ramblings (\"Crisp white sheets!\", \"Salvation!\", etc.) would result in him gaining a particularly memetic status among Ace Combat fans.\r\n\r\nh4.
