On 22 June 1941 the Axis invaded the Soviet Union during \"Operation Barbarossa\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa . Axis land forces reached the Crimea in the autumn of 1941 and overran most of the area. The only objective not in Axis hands was Sevastopol. \r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were made to secure the port in October and November 1941. A major attack was planned for late November, but heavy rains delayed it until 17 December 1941. Under the command of [[Erich von Manstein]], Axis forces were unable to capture Sevastopol during this first operation. Soviet forces launched [[battle_of_the_kerch_peninsula|an amphibious landing on the Crimean peninsula at Kerch]] in December 1941 to relieve the siege and force the Axis to divert forces to defend their gains. The operation saved Sevastopol for the time being, but the bridgehead in the eastern Crimea was eliminated in May 1942.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of their first assault on Sevastopol, the Axis opted to conduct siege warfare until the middle of 1942, at which point they attacked the encircled Soviet forces by land, sea, and air. On 2 June 1942, the Axis began this operation, codenamed Störfang (Sturgeon Catch). The [[Soviet Army]] and the Black Sea Fleet of the [[Soviet Navy]] held out for weeks under intense Axis bombardment. The [[Luftwaffe]] played a vital part in the siege, its 8th Air Corps bombing the besieged Soviet forces with impunity, flying 23,751 sorties and dropping 20,528 tons of bombs in June alone. At the end of the siege, there were only 11 undamaged buildings left in Sevastopol. The Luftwaffe sank or deterred most Soviet attempts to evacuate their troops by sea. The German 11th Army suppressed and destroyed the defenders by firing 46,750 tons of artillery ammunition on them during Störfang.\r\n\r\nFinally, on 4 July 1942, the remaining Soviet forces surrendered and the Germans seized the port. The Soviet Separate Coastal Army was annihilated, with 118,000 men killed, wounded or captured in the final assault and 200,481 casualties in the siege as a whole for both it and the Black Sea Fleet. Axis losses in Störfang amounted to 35,866 men, of whom 27,412 were German and 8,454 Romanian. With the Soviet forces neutralized, the Axis refocused their attention on the major summer campaign of that year, \"Case Blue\", and the advance to the Caucasus oilfields (\"Baku\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku) that led to the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["塞瓦斯托波尔","Sevastopol"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":73957,"created_at":"2016-03-27T09:17:30.448-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-10T21:04:31.258-05:00","title":"gerbera_tetra","body":"A fictional [[mecha]] from the [[Gundam]] series.\r\n\r\n[b]AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra[/b]\r\n\r\nA [[mobile suit]] which appeared in [[Gundam 0083]] and was piloted by [[Cima Garahau]].

He was the middle child of a family of seven brothers, and, in his early childhood, Matsumoto was given a 35mm film projector by his father, and watched American cartoons during the Pacific War. During this time, he gained an interest in science fiction novels by authors Unno Juza and H. G. Wells. At 18, he moved to Tokyo, to become a manga artist.\r\n\r\nMatsumoto made his debut under his real name, Matsumoto Akira, in 1953. He would have his big break with Otoko Oidon, a series that chronicled the life of a rōnin (a young man who was preparing himself for entrance examinations to universities and colleges), in 1971. Around the same time he started a series of unconnected short stories set during [[World War II]], the \"Senjou Manga Series\", which would eventually become popular under the title [[The Cockpit]]. A year later in 1972 he radically changed genres and published a [[cowboy western]] manga called [[gun_frontier_(western)|Gun Frontier]]. \r\n \r\nHe was later involved in several [[Science fiction]] works including [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]] (1974) and the debut of the highly popular series Captain [[Harlock]] and Galaxy Express 999 (both in 1977). In 1978, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen for Galaxy Express 999 and his Senjou Manga Series. Animated versions of Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999 are set in the same universe, which spanned several spin offs and related series, most notably [[Queen Emeraldas]] and Queen Millennia.\r\n\r\nMatsumoto supervised the creation of several music videos for the French house group [[Daft Punk]], set to tracks from their album Discovery. These videos were issued end-to-end (making a full-length animated movie) on a DVD release titled [[Interstella 5555]]: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.\r\n\r\nAbout two dozen bronze statues — each perhaps four feet tall — of characters and scenes from Space Battleship Yamato and Galaxy Express 999 were erected in the downtown area of Tsuruga in 1999. Each statue includes a plaque at its base explaining the character, and featuring Matsumoto's signature.\r\n\r\nMatsumoto worked with Nishizaki Yoshinobu on Space Battleship Yamato (known outside Japan under various names but most commonly as Star Blazers). Matsumoto created a manga loosely based on the series, and the Yamato makes cameo appearances (sans crew) in several of his works including the Galaxy Express 999 manga.\r\n\r\nA work by Matsumoto called Great Yamato featuring an updated Yamato had to be renamed Great Galaxy due to legal issues with Nishizaki. As of 2009, Matsumoto and Nishizaki were working on independent anime projects featuring the acclaimed Space Battleship Yamato, with the conditions that Matsumoto cannot use the name Yamato or the plot or characters from the original, and Nishizaki cannot use the conceptual art, character or ship designs of the original. Since Nishizaki's death in 2010, it is uncertain whether these restrictions will continue to apply.\r\n\r\nHis wife is shōjo manga artist Maki Miyako (better known as the creator of the doll [[Super Doll Licca-chan]], the Japanese equivalent of Barbie). Matsumoto passed away in February 13, 2023 due to acute heart failure. According to his daughter [i]\"he now rests in the sea of stars...\".[/i]\r\n\r\nh4.Famous works\r\n\r\n* [[Harlock Saga]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]]\r\n* [[Ginga Tetsudou 999]]\r\n* [[shin_taketori_monogatari_sennen_joou|Queen Millennia]]\r\n* [[Queen Emeraldas]]\r\n* [[The Cockpit]]\r\n* [[gun_frontier_(western)|Gun Frontier]]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Matsumoto Leiji (style)]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":181443,"created_at":"2024-01-09T03:51:39.315-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-09T03:51:39.315-05:00","title":"gransolfachord_coolia","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["グランドレミコード・クーリア"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":181442,"created_at":"2024-01-09T03:51:15.808-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-09T03:51:15.808-05:00","title":"dosolfachord_coolia","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ドドレミコード・クーリア"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":181441,"created_at":"2024-01-09T03:50:44.691-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-09T03:50:44.691-05:00","title":"the_weather_painter_moonbow","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["月天気アルシエル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":181440,"created_at":"2024-01-09T03:50:19.105-05:00","updated_at":"2024-01-09T03:50:19.105-05:00","title":"the_weather_painter_rainbow","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["虹天気アルシエル"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":140310,"created_at":"2022-03-18T13:42:41.488-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-09T03:43:21.787-05:00","title":"dag_doll","body":"A fictional [[mecha]] from [[Gundam]].

Combined with four number flags, it represents the time in UTC. On its own, it may mean \"I require a tug\" or \"I am shooting nets\".\r\n\r\nThe Z flag is of special significance in the context of Japanese naval history due to its role in the Battle of Tsushima where it was raised on the flagship [[mikasa_(battleship)|Mikasa]]. In this battle, the Z flag was understood to mean, \"The fate of the Empire rests on the outcome of this battle. Let each man do his utmost\". However, the flag has gradually gained more notoriety after it was used as a signal flag of the Attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on board the flagship [[Akagi (aircraft carrier)|]], along with being a battle flag in several major engagements in [[World War II]] (including the last voyage of the battleship [[Yamato (battleship)|]] during [[Operation Ten-Gou]]). As a result, much like the [[imperial war flag|Imperial German war flag]], it has turned into a symbol for far-right Japanese ultranationalism.\r\n\r\nh4.
