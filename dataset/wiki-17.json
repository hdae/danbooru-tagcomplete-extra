It was Tomino's attempt to launch a new U.C. Gundam saga, set 30 years after [[Char's Counterattack]].

The film was first released in [[Japan]] on March 16, 1991.\r\n\r\nSet in [b]U.C. 0123[/b] (44 years after [[mobile_suit_gundam|the original Gundam]]), the story of Gundam F91 revolves around teenage space colonist [[Seabook Arno]], his girlfriend [[Cecily Fairchild]], and the efforts of the [[Crossbone Vanguard]] militia to establish an aristocracy known as \"Cosmo Babylonia\". In keeping with Gundam tradition, the civilian Seabook is forced by circumstance to pilot the [[F91 Gundam]], coincidentally designed in part by his estranged mother, Dr. [[Monica Arno]].\r\n\r\nChronologically continued by [[Crossbone Gundam]] and [[Victory Gundam]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It is now used as a generic term for any manner of tube-like shoulder-fired rocket launcher, but that's not what the Danbooru tag is for.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by the [[United States Army]] and approved for service in 1940, the M1 Bazooka was the first of its kind: using a rocket (rather than an anti-tank rifle or a handheld grenade) to shoot a shaped charge at enemy tanks. The Bazooka saw extensive use on all fronts of the war, used against enemy bunkers, pillboxes, fortified positions, and even tanks. \r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in early 1943, many examples of the Bazooka fell into German hands. Impressed with the innovative idea, the Germans copied the Bazooka wholesale, enlarging the rocket and adding a shield to the tube to protect the shooter from backblast, calling the new weapon the [[panzerschreck]], or \"tank terror\".\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

The project had been given the nickname \"[[Blue Archive]] with Swords\" or \"Red Archive\" due to not only sharing a similar theme of school girls with [[halo]]s and weapons, but is made by several former Blue Archive developers.\r\n\r\nIt was initially teased on August 18th, 2024, before a promo video officially revealed it on September 1st, with a visual novel planned for [[Comiket 105]], and a gacha game speculated to release in the future. The project has been \"cancelled\":[https://x.com/DynamisOne/status/1832722210160554111] on September 8th, 2024, speculated to be due to both controversy surrounding accusations of plagiarism, and a suspected threat of a copyright infringement lawsuit from [[Nexon]], Blue Archive's publisher.\r\n\r\nPeculiarly, since the project's announcement, it has spawned a trend of [[futanari]] fanarts. This trend stemmed from the Korean community, where it was joked that the project would be more popular if it involved \"cockfighting\" rather than \"sword fighting\". The original jokes originated from joking KV stood for the Korean slang words \"kochu\" (sword) and \"valgi\" (sword drawing), which is used for [[penis]] and [[erection]], respectively.\r\n\r\nOn February 27th, 2025, it was revealed that the project was originally developed by Nexon, titled \"MX Blade,\" serving as a side story to Blue Archive in production years before Blue Archive was released. With the aftermath of the incident induced by Dynamis One, this original project has since been shelved. Dynamis One would respond on March 18th, however by that point the relevant team members were already in captivity before the announcement post was even shared with the public. \r\n\r\nh4.

However, many Freikorps also largely despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters, later aiding the [[Nazi|NSDAP]] in it’s rise to power.\r\n\r\nModern German historians agree that men of the Freikorps consistently embodied post-Enlightenment masculine ideals that are characterized by \"physical, emotional, and moral 'hardness'\". Men in the Freikorps radicalized Western and German norms of male self-control into a perpetual war against feminine-coded desires for domesticity, tenderness, and compassion amongst men.

Zenra fetish features people (usually women) participating in everyday tasks that they might otherwise perform clothed, such as casual scenes with participants playing in an all-nude orchestra in a seemingly oblivious state of mind towards their nudity.\r\n\r\nOthers incorporate the nudity on a more conscious level by doing such things as playing \"[[strip game|strip volleyball]]\", where the participants must remove clothing each time the other team scores a point. While in some case [[sex]] and sexual acts were treated as a normal recreational activity in the setting, including in public places.\r\n\r\nWhile very similar to [[exhibitionism]] and [[nudist|nudism]] in concept and often overlaps with each other, zenra fetish can be distinguished by how the setting treated nudity and sexual activity, as zenra fetish treats nudity either as a social norm at best and a minor inconvenience at worst. In addition, some zenra works also further emphasize sexual elements of the character (such as character exposing their private parts) as another form of beauty standard.\r\n\r\nPlease note that [[bathing]] or tanning on the beach are not zenra as that is normally done naked. In addition, since the word is used as a Pixiv tag for a [[completely nude]] character, only apply \"zenra\" tag if the setting is applicable.\r\n\r\nh6. As a rule of thumb:\r\n* If the person in nude is aware of their nudity and is not in the act that requires them to be in nude (such as [[bathing]]) but does not attempt to cover it and acts as normal, then the tag \"[[nudist]]\" is applicable.\r\n* If the person in nude is in public place, being in presence with other people, or is overtly showing their state of nudity to others, then the tag \"[[exhibitionism]]\" is applicable.\r\n* If the setting of the image treats the state of nudity or sexual act as a normal activity, then the tag \"zenra\" is applicable.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was created by [[Matsumoto Leiji]] and Nishizaki Yoshinobu in the early 1970s. \r\n\r\nThe first TV anime series aired on Yomiuri TV in October 6, 1974 and was followed by several animated movie sequels and two more TV series seasons (broadcast in 1978 and 1980 respectively). \r\n\r\nIt is notable because it was one of the first military science fiction anime that depicted space battleships and cosmic [[battle]]s among fleets of spaceships. Its creators were also inspired by [[Star Trek]] when the series was being developed. \r\n\r\nUchuu Senkan Yamato influenced several later sci-fi anime like [[Gundam]], [[Macross]], [[Top wo Nerae!]] (Gunbuster) and [[Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu]] (Legend of the Galactic Heroes) among others. It also influenced various productions in the west, like [[Star Wars]] and [[Battlestar Galactica]] (both the original and re-imagined versions).\r\n\r\nIt is known to English-speaking audiences as [b]Space Battleship Yamato[/b] and also as [b]Star Blazers[/b]. In Spanish and Latin American countries it was called [b]Astronave Intrepido[/b] (\"Starship Intrepid\"). In European and Asian countries it was also called [b]Estrellas Luminosas[/b] (\"Luminous Stars\"), [b]Cosmoship Yamato[/b], [b]Anti-Space Ship[/b], [b]Journey to the Final Galaxy[/b] and [b]Star Patrol[/b]. \r\n\r\nIts last anime film sequel to the original series was released on December 2009 and a live action film adaptation of the first TV series was released on December 2010 in Japan. \r\n\r\nA new reboot series based on the first season called [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199]] was released in 2012. A  series sequel to 2199 called [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202: Ai no Senshi-Tachi]] was released in 2018. \r\n\r\nThe latest animated film series (sequel to 2202) were released in 2021 with the name [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2205: Arata Naru Tabidachi]].\r\n\r\nh4.Spacecraft\r\n\r\n* [[Yamato (Uchuu Senkan Yamato)|Yamato (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[andromeda (uchuu senkan yamato)|Andromeda (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[Mogami (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[Yukikaze (Spaceship)]]\r\n* [[Freedom (Uchuu Senkan Yamato)]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Zero]]\r\n* [[Black Tiger (Yamato)]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Tiger]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Falcon]]\r\n* [[Cosmo Rhino]]\r\n\r\nh4.Characters\r\n\r\n* [[Okita Juuzou]]\r\n* [[Kodai Susumu]]\r\n* [[Kodai Mamoru]]\r\n* [[Mori Yuki]]\r\n* [[Shima Daisuke]]\r\n* [[Sado Sakezou]]\r\n* [[Analyzer (uchuu senkan yamato)|]]\r\n* [[Aihara Yoshikazu]]\r\n* [[Kato Saburou]]\r\n* [[Sanada Shirou]]\r\n* [[Nanbu Yasuo]]\r\n* [[Desler]]\r\n* [[Shultz]]\r\n* [[Starsha]]\r\n* [[Iscandar]]\r\n* [[Yamamoto Akira]]\r\n* [[Niimi Kaoru]]\r\n* [[Harada Makoto]]\r\n* [[Misaki Yuria]]\r\n* [[Itou Shin'ya]]\r\n* [[Miezela Celestella]]\r\n* [[Hilde Schultz]]\r\n* [[Melda Deitz]]\r\n* [[Mirenel Linke]] \r\n* [[Yabu (Uchuu Senkan Yamato)]]\r\n* [[Itou Shin'ya]] \r\n* [[Kiryuu Mikage]]\r\n* [[Saijou Miki]]\r\n* [[Domel]]\r\n* [[Elisa Domel]]\r\n* [[Wolf Fleurken]]\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Cosmo Nambu]]\r\n* [[Gamilas]] (Gamilon)\r\n* [[Final Yamato]]\r\n* [[Yamato2520]]\r\n* [[Rebirth Yamato]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202: Ai no Senshi-Tachi]]\r\n* [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2205: Arata Naru Tabidachi]]\r\n\r\nh4.

As Corrin comes of age, they find themselves the subject of a stirring conflict between the two nations and must choose families, deciding the course of fate.\r\n\r\nMuch like Kris in [i][[Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem]][/i] and Robin in [i][[Fire Emblem Awakening]][/i], Corrin is an avatar character, with their name, gender, appearance, and voice customizable by the player. As such, some media refers to Corrin as simply the [b]Avatar[/b] (マイユニット My Unit).\r\n\r\nCorrin is a descendant of the First Dragons. Carrying ancient dragon blood, they are able to tap the power of Dragon Veins to manipulate the territory around them. They are also able to turn into a [[dragon]], though they normally only do so involuntarily and out of insanity. As a result, Corrin keeps a [[dragonstone]] on their person to assume full control of their transforming powers.\r\n\r\nCorrin's dragon form and gentle personality are strongly based on the [i][[qilin (mythology)|]][/i], a chimerical creature that, in Chinese mythology, primarily symbolizes benevolence and fortune. It is said to foretell the birth or arrival of an illustrious ruler or great human being.\r\n\r\nMale Corrin has [[short hair|short]], [[spiked hair]], while female Corrin has [[long hair|long]], [[wavy hair]] and [[juliet sleeves]], and wears a black [[headband]], often along with a Nohrian [[hairpin]]. They have [[red eyes]], [[pointy ears]], and [[bangs]] that drape over their forehead and slightly to the side. By default, they wear a silver [[cuirass]] with gray and black accents, as well as a [[collar]] with [[buckle]]s on the sides. It is worn over black clothing that covers Corrin's hands, and their [[arm guards]] broaden just below shoulder height.\r\n\r\nCorrin also sports a long [[blue cape]] that wraps around their right hip and upwards against their back and is fastened by a [[brooch]] on their [[breastplate]]. Their [[leg armor]] notably does not cover their thighs, which are either completely covered (male Corrin) or [[thigh cutout|exposed]] (female Corrin) by their [[leggings]]. An additional [[kusazuri]]-like piece of leather covers their left thigh. They are almost always seen [[barefoot]], wielding the legendary [[sword]] [[Yato (fire_emblem)|]].\r\n\r\nIn Japanese, male Corrin is voiced by [[Shimazaki Nobunaga]], while female Corrin is voiced by [[Satou Satomi]]. They cover all the customizable voice options in [i][[Fire Emblem Fates|Fates]][/i], although their written dialogue differs between options (including a completely silent one).\r\n\r\nIn English, male Corrin is voiced by \"Cam Clarke\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Clarke, with certain voice options in [i][[Fire Emblem Fates|Fates]][/i] voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. Similarly, Female Corrin is voiced by Marcella Lentz-Pope, with the other voice options in [i][[Fire Emblem Fates|Fates]][/i] voiced by Danielle Judovits and \"Stephanie Lemelin\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Lemelin.\r\n\r\n[b]Starting Class:[/b] Nohr Prince/Nohr Princess\r\n\r\nh4.

It should not be confused with the quite different Stetson hat type with a different brim and crease, commonly known as the cowboy hat, and which is more commonly meant by the term \"Stetson\" today. The campaign hat also should not be confused with a slouch hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral U.S. state police services (for example, the Utah Highway Patrol), and federal agencies (for example, the United States Border Patrol) wear campaign hats. These state troopers are responsible for state and interstate highway safety, and in this capacity are variously referred to in different states as State Police, Highway Patrol, State Patrol, and State Highway Patrol. So common is use of the campaign hat among state highway police that they are sometimes referred to as \"smokey bears\" or \"smokeys,\" after Smokey Bear the famous logo-character of the U.S. Forest Service. The only State Police agencies that do not employ the “smokey bear hat”, are the New York State Police, Connecticut State Police, New Jersey State Police, Texas Highway Patrol, Maryland State Police, New Mexico State Police, and the Michigan State Police. There is no direct association between the cartoon bear and the Highway Patrol; they both derive their hat styles ultimately from the U.S. Cavalry.\r\n\r\nMany other [[police]] agencies, including numerous county [[sheriff (contemporary)|]]s' services including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, use campaign hats. Some local police use it for particular duties or divisions; for example, officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s and [[Chicago Police Department]]'s mounted units employ the hat, and deputy sheriffs assigned as cadre of the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp wear campaign hats.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231746,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:56:35.711-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:56:35.711-04:00","title":"unrivaled_piercer_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アンライバルドピアッサー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231745,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:55:02.306-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:55:02.306-04:00","title":"emuto_ambition_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エムートアンビシオン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231744,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:54:53.896-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:54:53.896-04:00","title":"empress_charm_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["エンプレスチャーム"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231743,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:47:05.693-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:47:05.693-04:00","title":"summer_grace_one_piece_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["サマーグレイスワンピ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231742,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:46:27.911-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:46:27.911-04:00","title":"abyssal_majesty_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アビサルマジェスティ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231741,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:46:13.610-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:46:13.610-04:00","title":"nuo'er_ajinni","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["诺尔·阿金妮"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231740,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:37:07.162-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:37:07.162-04:00","title":"charming_venus_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["チャーミングヴィーナス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231739,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:34:30.303-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:34:30.303-04:00","title":"candy_lady_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["キャンディレディ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231738,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:34:12.920-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:34:12.920-04:00","title":"hula_aloha_girl_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["フラALOHAガール"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":231737,"created_at":"2025-03-15T23:31:55.484-04:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:31:55.484-04:00","title":"schooldays_blazer_(idolmaster)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スクールデイズブレザー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":178252,"created_at":"2023-12-01T11:01:38.061-05:00","updated_at":"2025-03-15T23:31:42.119-04:00","title":"belle_(zenless_zone_zero)","body":"One of the selectable playable main characters in [[Zenless Zone Zero]].\r\n\r\nBelle, along with her brother [[Wise (Zenless Zone Zero)|]], manage the Random Play video store on Sixth Street in New Eridu and form the team behind the legendary Proxy identity \"Phaethon\".\r\n\r\nHer name in the Japanese translation is [b]Rin[/b].\r\n\r\nVoiced in Japanese by [[Senbongi Sayaka]] and Courtney Steele in English.\r\n\r\nh4.

The Saints have sworn to defend the reincarnation of the benevolent Greek goddess [[Athena (saint seiya)|]] in her battle against other evil Olympian and Norse mythology gods who want to dominate Earth.\r\n\r\nThe manga was adapted into an anime television series by [[Toei Animation]] with character designs and art by [[Araki Shingo]] that ran from 1986 to 1989, before being continued in the form of three original video animation series between 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\nFour animated feature films were shown in Japanese theaters from 1987 to 1989, with a fifth in 2004 and a sixth in 2014. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, creator Kurumada published a sequel manga titled [[Saint Seiya: Next Dimension]]. Several spin-off manga by different authors have also been created, as well as a standalone anime and original net animation.\r\n\r\nSaint Seiya has been very successful, with over 34 million copies sold in Japan alone. The series began to be known in the west after it became popular in France in 1988, where it was given the French name of [i]Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque[/i]; this was also the first foreign release of the series. Since the early 90s the series also became very popular in Spanish-speaking countries after it was released in Spain as \"Los Caballeros del Zodiaco\". \r\n\r\nBecause of its popularity many RPG, action and fighting video games based on the series have been released in the last decades.\r\n\r\nh4.
