It is initially believed to be the Berserker-class Servant of Alice, and it has an overwhelming presence. It uses a skill called Alice Eater (ありすイーター, Arisu Ītā?) to temporarily strengthen itself.\r\nIts strength shakes the Arena itself, and simply nearing it allows for its fierce, swirling magical power to be felt. It can overwhelmingly defeat Hakuno Kishinami's Servant, and the only defense is to retreat because Alice doesn't have it to pursue them due to wishing to wait for Hakuno to \"play\" with her. It is created through their power, and it will stay until its granted magical energy is depleted. In the Fate/EXTRA Manga, it was shown that while Saber and Lancer could damage the Jabberwocky, it simply regenerated from its injuries, even restoring its decapitated head with no issue.\r\n\r\nIt can only be defeated by the Vorpal Blade, a \"blade of legend that no one has ever seen\", a Mystic Code weapon that has an effect on certain types of monstrosities. It is from the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol, depicting a nameless hero's quest to slay the fearsome beast. It is not something found normally within the Moon Cell, but crafted by an alchemist with Malachite. The one created by Rani VIII is only able to be used once. It emanates magic as it nears the Jabberwock, shrinking his aura and allowing for him to be defeated in regular combat.\r\n\r\nhttps://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Nursery_Rhyme_(Noble_Phantasm)","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":221172,"created_at":"2025-01-07T10:34:02.396-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-07T10:34:02.396-05:00","title":"yamashio_maru_(miko)_(kancolle)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["山汐丸(巫女)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":47919,"created_at":"2013-08-05T09:29:49.192-04:00","updated_at":"2025-01-07T10:25:34.324-05:00","title":"trespasser_(kaiju)","body":"A fictional [[Kaiju]] [[monster]] from the [[Pacific Rim]] science fiction [[mecha]] series.

Overview\r\n\r\nDanbooru generally tries to use the original names of artists, characters and titles, but for practical reasons, like Japanese being gobbledygook to most of our users, they have to be represented in the Latin alphabet. For this Danbooru has its own set of romanization rules based on the [b]revised[/b] Hepburn romanization scheme.\r\n\r\nThese rules are used both for tagging and for translations.\r\n\r\nThe system is used here because it has been deemed practical for the community's needs. The main goal is [b]consistency[/b]; secondarily, to give a good idea of the original (hiragana and katakana) spellings and pronunciations.\r\n\r\nh4#disclaim. DISCLAIMER\r\nh6. Should any official romanization exist, they take precedence over this standard.\r\n\r\n* See forum #168056 for details.\r\n* Changing such romanized tags to a more \"correct\" version would be counterproductive for search usage.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between [b]Wikipedia[/b] romanizations and Danbooru romanizations is that Wikipedia uses macrons for certain long vowels (e.g. [i]seiyū[/i]), while Danbooru uses the so-called waapuro style (e.g. [i]seiyuu[/i]; see below).\r\n\r\nFor non-Japanese romanizations, scroll to the bottom.\r\n\r\nh4#guide. General Guidelines\r\n\r\nThe key points of the Danbooru romanization standard:\r\n\r\n* For basic \"gojuuon\":[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon]: [i]し→shi, ち→chi, つ→tsu, ふ→fu[/i].\r\n* For basic \"youon\":[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Don]: [i]きゃ→kya, しゃ→sha, ちゃ→cha, にゃ→nya, ひゃ→hya, みゃ→mya, りゃ→rya[/i] (etc., symmetrically).\r\n* For gojuuon with (han)dakuten: [i]ざ→za, じ→ji, ず→zu[/i] (etc.).\r\n**  づ and ず both become [i]zu[/i], while ぢ and じ both become [i]ji[/i].\r\n* For youon with (han)dakuten: [i]じゃ→ja[/i] (etc.).\r\n* ん becomes [i]n[/i], unless followed by a vowel or a [i]y-[/i] sound, in which case it becomes [i]n'[/i]: [i]せんかん → senkan, にんい → nin'i, じゅんや → jun'ya[/i].\r\n* Long vowels follow their hiragana spellings:  [i]えい→ei, おう→ou, おお→oo, とお→too, ゆう→yuu[/i] (etc.).\r\n** \"ー\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Donpu is to be replaced by doubling the preceding vowel, e.g. [i]ハー→haa[/i].\r\n* Gemination, marked with a \"sokuon\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon symbol (っ in hiragana and ッ in katakana), is shown by doubling the consonant: きっと → [i]kitto[/i], いっぱい → [i]ippai[/i], ほっかい → [i]hokkai[/i].\r\n** If a consonant sound is represented by a digraph, only the first letter is doubled: エッチ → [i]ecchi[/i], いっしょ → [i]issho[/i], みっつ → [i]mittsu[/i].\r\n* When used as a topical particle, は becomes [i]wa[/i]. When used as a lative particle, へ becomes [i]e[/i]. を remains [i]wo[/i] in all contexts.\r\n* Japanese names are generally written in Japanese-style \"Surname Given-name\" order. For details, see \"the passage on name order under tagging help\":/help/tags.\r\n\r\nFor anything not covered by these rules, follow the \"revised Hepburn romanization system\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization.\r\n\r\nThese romanization rules have been worked out as the site grew, and there are still many tags that are not compliant with the guidelines. If you spot any poorly romanized tags, please post a message in the forum.\r\n\r\nh4#example. Examples\r\n\r\n* あずまんが大王 → あずまんがだいおう → Danbooru: [i]Azumanga Daiou[/i], [b]Official: [[Azumanga Daioh]][/b].\r\n* イリヤスフィール・フォン・アインツベルン → [[Illyasviel von Einzbern]].  [b]For non-Japanese or outright made-up proper names, use their official spellings where possible.[/b]\r\n* 幻想郷 → げんそうきょう → [[Gensokyo]].\r\n* 天王 はるか → てんおう はるか → [[Ten'ou Haruka]].  (The apostrophe is needed here to distinguish てんおう from てのう.)\r\n* 遠坂 凛 → とおさか りん → Danbooru: [i]Toosaka Rin[/i], [b]Official: [[Tohsaka Rin]][/b].\r\n* 葉月 → はづき → \"Hazuki\":/users/615.\r\n* 魔法少女リリカルなのは → まほうしょうじょリリカルなのは → [[Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha]]. [b]For foreign words like[/b] [i]lyrical[/i], [b]follow the spellings of their respective source languages.[/b]\r\n** ランドセル → [[randoseru]]. As an exception to the above, [b]loanwords whose semantics have changed in the borrowing process are often romanized as if they were Japanese.[/b]\r\n\r\nh4#miss. Mistakes to avoid\r\n\r\n* [i]とおの → toono[/i], [b]not[/b] [i]*tono, *tōno, *tohno[/i] or [i]*touno[/i].  Watch out for style differences like this when referencing other sources, [b]unless the official romanization says [i]tohno[/i][/b].\r\n* [i]ゆうか → yuuka[/i], [b]not[/b] [i]*yuka[/i] or [i]*yūka[/i].  Long vowels again, [b]unless the official romanization says [i]yuka[/i][/b].\r\n\r\nh4#other. Briefly on non-Japanese languages\r\n\r\nFor other languages, the same guidelines and principles mentioned apply, focusing on official/standard/common romanizations first, due to recognizability, and consistency second.\r\n\r\nFor Chinese, \"pinyin\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin] is the preferred means of romanization. However, diacritic marks are not used in tags, so they must be dropped (e.g. using [[Beijing]], if rendered in pinyin with its diacritics, it would be [i]Běijīng[/i]). If any further information is required on the given Chinese characters present, utilize a resource such as \"Wiktionary\":[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%AC%BC] or the \"Chinese Text Project\":[https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=%E9%AC%BC].\r\n\r\nFor Korean, the \"Revised Romanization\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean] used in South Korea is the preferred means of romanization. For Korean names, unless a specific romanized spelling is provided, utilize the most common spelling as used by resources such as Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nFor Cyrillic, user discretion is advised, as romanization standards vary across the various languages which make use of Cyrillic. As such, focus on identifying the language rather than relying on the script itself. The most common means of romanization for each Cyrillic-using language is preferred, which can be found on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nIn several languages which utilize the Latin alphabet, in contrast to English, there is regular use of diacritics (e.g. German). While in some languages there are standardized means of transcribing these diacritics as to retain the word's original spelling (e.g. Ä as Ae), in others there are not, and will involve dropping the diacritics to render their words in an environment where they cannot be accessed. User discretion is advised on how to handle diacritics at a given moment.\r\n\r\nh4#return.

It should be noted that the Chinese new year is not on January 1 of the Gregorian calendar, but instead varies from one year to the next (falling in either late January or early February). The year of the horse, for example, begins January 31, 2014. Despite this, images utilizing the animal of an upcoming Chinese New Year tend to begin appearing around January 1, as Japan uses the same zodiac but does not use the Chinese Lunar calendar. \r\n\r\nThe typical way of telling if an image is celebrating the New Year is by the phrase 謹賀新年 ([i]kinga shinnen[/i], literally \"happy new year\") or by one or both of the more traditional greeting exchanges (shortened as [[akeome]] and [[kotoyoro]]). It is also common for New Year images to include [[Happy New Year]] in English text, and/or the number of the year. Text indicating a new year related image may also be absent from the image itself but present in Pixiv tags/artist commentary, website text, etc. \r\n\r\nh4.

It is considered the first true 3D FPS game, unlike [[doom (series)|DooM]], which was actually 2.5D.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players must find their way out of various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using a wide array of guns. The game's monsters were inspired by the creatures from [[h_p_lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. \r\n\r\nThe successor to id's [[doom (series)|Doom]] series, Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor in many ways. Unlike the Doom engine before it, the Quake engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. \r\n\r\nQuake was programmed by John Carmack, Michael Abrash and John Cash. The level and scenarios were designed by American McGee, Sandy Petersen, John Romero and Tim Willits. The graphics were designed by Adrian Carmack, and Kevin Cloud. Music and sound design was by Trent Reznor, founder of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The game engine developed for Quake, the \"Quake engine\", popularized several major advances in the 3D game genre: polygonal models instead of prerendered sprites; full 3D level design instead of a 2.5D map; prerendered lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with QuakeC), which popularized fan-created modifications or \"mods\".\r\n\r\nAfter DooM helped popularize multiplayer deathmatches, Quake added various multiplayer options. Various multiplayer mods were developed including Team Fortress and Capture The Flag.\r\n\r\nThe game received much acclaim on release and its commercial success led to several sequels, starting with [[Quake 2]], which abandoned the gothic stylings of the original for a [[science fiction]] theme. Because of this, Quake has since been recognized as one of the greatest achievements of the video game industry, influencing games that came after it, as well as the artforms of user mods and machinima.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* [[Shambler]]\r\n* [[Shambler-Chan]]\r\n* [[Chthon]]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Quake"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":221060,"created_at":"2025-01-06T07:31:17.686-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-06T07:31:17.686-05:00","title":"hagi_(goukon)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["萩"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":221059,"created_at":"2025-01-06T07:30:59.445-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-06T07:30:59.445-05:00","title":"asagi_(goukon)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["浅葱"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":221058,"created_at":"2025-01-06T07:30:40.755-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-06T07:30:40.755-05:00","title":"tokiwa_(goukon)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["常盤"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":167335,"created_at":"2023-06-21T00:45:29.177-04:00","updated_at":"2025-01-06T07:29:38.909-05:00","title":"shalala_(precure)","body":"A supporting character from [[Hirogaru Sky!

Afterward, [i]Arashi[/i] sped at full speed to rejoin her sister destroyers screening the four Kido Butai carriers, leaving a long white wake for [[Enterprise (Azur Lane)|]]'s dive bomber squadrons, then at the limits of their search, to trail Arashi to the carriers. These dive bombers soon found the carriers in the middle of fending off [[Hornet (Azur Lane)|]] and [[Yorktown (Azur Lane)|]]'s torpedo bomber attacks, leaving no combat air patrol to challenge them in their dive bomb attacks that fatally damaged three of the four carriers.\r\n\r\nLater, Nautilus herself tried to attack the burning [[Kaga (Azur Lane)|]] but scored only one dud hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

Even then, she took longer to complete as her original hull was damaged beyond repair in an earthquake in 1923 and had to be rebuilt from scratch. At the start of the war, she led the Fourth Destroyer Squadron and operated alongside her sister [[Jintsuu (Azur Lane)|]] and the Second Destroyer Squadron. While in an operation in the Indian Ocean on April 1, 1942, she was hit by a torpedo from a US submarine that put her out of action for a year.

The real-life [i]Mogami[/i]\r\nIn real life, [i]Mogami[/i] and her sisters were designed by the IJN as light cruisers under the maximum allowed by the naval treaties in force during her time: 10,000 tons and 15.5 cm main guns.\r\nTo save weight, electric welding was used, aluminum was selected for the superstructure, a single trunked funnel was installed instead of two common to the older heavy cruisers, and decent armor. Unfortunately, the extensive weight reductions led to chronic instability while gunnery trials resulted in cracking of the hull welds. As soon as Japan withdrew from the treaty system, the class was taken in hand for a reconstruction that improved their hulls and swapped their 15.5 cm guns for heavier 20.3 cm ones as the class was specifically designed for CL to CA conversion with ease.\r\n\r\nIn the early Pacific War, she was responsible for the torpedo salvo that accidentally sank army transports in the battle of Sunda Strait, an act that was historically blamed on [[Fubuki (Azur Lane)|]]. Later in the [[battle of Midway]], she accidentally collided with her sister Mikuma, crippling her and leaving her at the mercy of US aircraft from the carriers and Midway itself. The damage sustained by [i]Mogami[/i] justified her selection for conversion to a seaplane cruiser that was completed in April 1943.\r\n\r\nLater, she was part of the first wave of ships in the notoriously ill-fated sortie up Surigao Strait. After the first wave under Shouji Nishimura was annihilated (except for Mogami and [i][[Shigure (Azur Lane)|]][/i]), Kiyohide Shima, the admiral leading the second wave, ordered a panicked retreat, causing the flagship [i][[Nachi (Azur Lane)|]][/i] to abruptly swing into the fleeing [i]Mogami[/i]'s path, causing a collision that crippled [i]Mogami[/i].

The same treaty also allowed her to be preserved as a museum in Yokosuka under the condition that her hull below the waterline be sealed in concrete.\r\n\r\nh4.
