Artists at the time took advantage of that and added \"subliminal\" images in their art as a bonus for those that use such browsers.\r\n\r\nh6. Explanation of how it works\r\n\r\nThe trick works because those legacy versions of Internet Explorer highlight images using a non-transparent grid pattern, which cancels out one of the two images that have been interleaved into one image using the grid pattern. It dosn't work in modern browsers because they tint images, rather than using the grid method.\r\n\r\nBasically, the grid method works like this. Two images are put together like so:\r\n\r\n121212121\r\n212121212\r\n121212121\r\n212121212\r\n\r\nWhen highlighted, the \"1\" image is masked by the highlight, thus this is the result:\r\n\r\n#2#2#2#2#\r\n2#2#2#2#2\r\n#2#2#2#2#\r\n2#2#2#2#2\r\n#2#2#2#2#\r\n\r\nand the second image can then be plainly seen.\r\n\r\nh6. Viewing hidden images without legacy versions of Internet Explorer\r\n\r\nHere is a method of revealing the hidden image using a layer-based image editor like Photoshop or GIMP:\r\n\r\n* Open the image.\r\n* Create a new black or white layer above the original image. On this new layer, attach a [i]layer mask[/i].\r\n* Render a 1-pixel black and white checkerboard pattern as the layer mask. This effectively creates an opaque solid color layer where every other pixel is transparent.\r\n* Nudge the checkerboard layer one pixel at a time to switch between images.\r\n\r\nConsult the documentation or Google instructions on how to use layer masks and render checkerboards in your image editor.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120467,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:12:26.571-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:12:26.571-05:00","title":"paradise_(visual_novel)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Paradise(BLゲーム)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120465,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:10:20.529-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:10:20.529-05:00","title":"megachu!","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["めがちゅ!"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120462,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:05:08.076-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:05:08.076-05:00","title":"lamento","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Lamento"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120460,"created_at":"2021-01-30T15:01:40.108-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T15:01:40.108-05:00","title":"galtia","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガルティア","GALTIA"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120458,"created_at":"2021-01-30T14:59:05.603-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:59:05.603-05:00","title":"swan_song","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["SWANSONG"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":8005,"created_at":"2008-08-05T22:29:55.319-04:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:57:01.732-05:00","title":"soshite_ashita_no_sekai_yori","body":"See \"Etude  Product Page\":http://www.etude-soft.jp/product/asuseka/index.html","is_locked":false,"other_names":["そして明日の世界より―"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":18436,"created_at":"2010-05-07T02:19:48.221-04:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:07:50.871-05:00","title":"figu@mate","body":"An adult game released by Escu:de in 2006.\r\n\r\nFandisc: [[Figu@Carnival]]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.escude.co.jp/product/figu/index.html\r\nhttp://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=275905","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ふぃぎゅ@メイト"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":120457,"created_at":"2021-01-30T14:07:33.707-05:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T14:07:33.707-05:00","title":"endou_ifrina","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["炎道イフリナ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":17868,"created_at":"2010-04-16T14:03:45.545-04:00","updated_at":"2021-01-30T12:26:04.135-05:00","title":"silent_sinner_in_blue","body":"東方儚月抄 (\"Touhou Bougetsushou\") ~ Silent Sinner in Blue\r\n\r\nAn official [[Touhou]] manga written by [[ZUN (artist)|]], with art by [[Aki Eda]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Therefore, chiffon cakes (as well as angel cakes and other foam cakes) achieve fluffiness by beating the egg whites separately until stiff and then folding them into the cake batter before baking. Its aeration depends on the quality of the [[meringue]] and the chemical leavening agent. Chiffon cake combines the methods of [[sponge cake]] and traditional cake. It includes baking powder and vegetable oil, but the eggs are separated and the egg whites are beaten and then folded into the batter, creating a rich flavor like an oil cake, but with a lighter texture, more like a sponge cake. It can be baked in a tube pan, or layered with filling and frosting.

The time can vary and is usually set from a few minutes to a few hours. Unlike sketching, speed painting can be considered \"finished\" when the time limit is reached. Speed painting is particularly common among digital media artists because the digital painting medium allows the work to circumvent the drying time of traditional media. Digital media artists primarily use speed painting to practice working quickly and efficiently. Speed painting techniques are also often used in conceptual art, especially in the early stages of production when the polish of a single image is more important than the clear basic presentation of many candidate concepts.\r\n\r\nTraditional media artists also use time-limited work as a challenge to technique and as an exercise in not overthinking the work. Both digital and traditional quick-draw works are considered by artists to be excellent demonstrations of the painter's subjective skills, as time constraints require efficient rendering of form and detail, as well as a deep understanding of the chosen medium, to capture a complete, intense image with little time left to notice and correct errors.
