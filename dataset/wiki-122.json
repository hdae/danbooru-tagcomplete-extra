These are the most popular versions of the series, especially outside of Japan (where the manga remained the most popular iteration of the series).

She refers to the Producer with the “-chan” honorific.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yui is a fun loving and excitable teen. She loves the freedom some roles give her, particularly that of a pirate. She tries to be mature by bringing her version of a hot drink to an onsen, but finds the cola to be disgusting due to it having gone flat. She is friends with Chinatsu and [[Mary Cochran]]. She wanted to walk with the Producer under an umbrella together and tried to get a taste of [[Mochizuki Hijiri]]’s cake until Hijiri began to cry in worry for a sugar figurine’s life.

She was her karate teams’ team captain and was the ranking National Champion. Karate is a major aspect of her life, but she wants to be a master of dance and song as well.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, unlike other idols' hobbies, Yuka’s is never visually incorporated into her idol costumes. She's shown to wear a karate gi in her first card illustration (taken before she became an idol), but it's never been shown on stage. Instead, her trademark is her two ponytails, and she gets very embarrassed if she's seen with her hair down.\r\n\r\nIn the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yuka is depicted as being abnormally strong. In her first appearance, she breaks a dartboard in half with a single throw. She has some experience with cooking, although she does have trouble keeping up with a pumped up [[Mukai Takumi]]. She participated in a talk battle with [[Hamaguchi Ayame]], [[Ohnuma Kurumi]], and [[Hayami Kanade]]. When she landed a role with [[Yamato Aki]] and [[Manabe Itsuki]] in a Kung Fu movie, she eagerly performed moves that had a focus on animal names.

The wrestler then does a spinning toe hold and grasps the other leg, crossing them into a \"4\" (hence the name) as he does so and falls to the mat, applying pressure to the opponent's crossed legs with his own. \r\n\r\nWhile the hold applies pressure to the knee, it actually can be very painful to the shin of the victim. While the move is primarily a submission move, if the opponent has his shoulders on the mat, the referee can make a three count for a pinfall. If the referee is distracted, heel wrestlers may grab onto the ropes while executing the move to gain leverage and inflict more pain. \r\n\r\nWith enough strength and willpower, the wrestler on defense can flip himself (and also their opponent) over onto their belly, which is said to reverse the pressure to the one who initially had the hold locked in.\r\n\r\nThis is innovated by \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers and popularized by Ric Flair.

The Allied reporting name for the type was [b]Mavis[/b]; the Navy designation was \"[b]Type 97 Large Flying Boat[/b]\" (九七式大型飛行艇).\r\n\r\nThe aircraft was designed in response to a Navy requirement of 1934 for a long-range flying boat and incorporated knowledge gleaned by a Kawanishi team that visited the Short Brothers factory in the UK.\r\n\r\nH6Ks were deployed from 1938 onwards, first seeing service in the Sino-Japanese War and were in widespread use by the time the full-scale Pacific War erupted, in December 1941. At that time of the war, four [i]Kōkūtai[/i] (air groups) operated a total of 66 H6K4s.\r\n\r\nThe type had some success over South East Asia and the South West Pacific. H6Ks had excellent endurance, being able to undertake 24-hour patrols, and were often used for long-range reconnaissance and bombing missions. From bases in the Dutch East Indies, they were able to undertake missions over a large portion of Australia.\r\n\r\nHowever, the H6K became vulnerable to a newer generation of more heavily armed and faster fighters. It continued in service throughout the war, in areas where the risk of interception was low. In front-line service, it was replaced by the Kawanishi H8K.\r\n\r\nh4.

The setting is moved to the year 5053 (vs. 1815-1838 in the novel), though the majority of the story remains in France. The protagonist is [[Albert de Morcerf]] instead of Edmond Dantes. \r\n\r\nThe series is notable for its use of a \"collage\" effect where the hair and clothing of characters act as \"holes\" to stationary backgrounds underneath (the pattern stays still, but the opening changes as the characters move around) (see post #139047 for a good example of the effect on Haydee). The series also makes heavy use of CG art.\r\n\r\nA manga by Maeda Mahiro, director of the TV series, was also released, beginning in 2005 in Kodansha's [i]Afternoon[/i].\r\n\r\nh4.

It needs some space behind the opponent to be effective, and can be applied from the side control or guard. Contrary to the americana, the opponent's wrist is grabbed with the hand on the same side, and the opposite arm is put behind the opponent's arm, again grabbing the attacker's wrist and forming a figure-four. By controlling the opponent's body and cranking the arm away from the attacker, pressure is put on the shoulder joint, and depending on the angle, also the elbow joint (in some variations the opponent's arm is brought behind their back, resulting in a finishing position resembling that of the hammerlock).\r\n\r\nThe kimura was named after the judoka Kimura Masahiko, who used it to defeat one of the founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hélio Gracie.
