It is characterized by split facial profiles, along with often two red exclamation points, \"!!\".\r\n\r\n[[Persona 4]] parody iterations are subtly different from [[Persona 3]] iterations. In Persona 4 parodies the characters sport glasses, whereas Persona 3 does not. Backgrounds are typically checker-patterned, and vary in color.\r\n\r\n[[Persona 5]] parodies are a significant departure from the 3 and 4 variants. Rather than the split-screen, character portraits are instead rendered on the debris from a shattered-screen effect. More commonly parodied from Persona 5 is the finishing screens that show up when the All-Out Attack finishes the fight, featuring the character that initiated the attack striking a pose while a personalized message appears on screen in a style specific to that character. [[Persona 3 Reload]] adds a similar finishing screen, albeit with a more restrained aesthetic compared to their P5 predecessors. \r\n\r\nPlease only use this tag for multiple characters in a picture, not for single expressions of [[!]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["総攻撃チャンス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":179816,"created_at":"2023-12-16T21:06:44.428-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-16T21:07:28.376-05:00","title":"sakuma_(joker_game)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["佐久間","佐久間(ジョーカー・ゲーム)","佐久間中尉"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":179815,"created_at":"2023-12-16T21:05:27.239-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-16T21:05:56.507-05:00","title":"miyoshi_(joker_game)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["三好","三好(ジョーカー・ゲーム)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":179808,"created_at":"2023-12-16T20:33:24.431-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-16T20:58:34.342-05:00","title":"dozle_zabi","body":"A fictional character from the [[Gundam]] franchise.
