Instead of a charger, single cartridges are inserted through the side opening, and are pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.

It was the first successful semi-automatic shotgun design, and remained in production until 1998.\r\n\r\nIt was the first mass-produced semi-automatic shotgun. Designed in 1898 and patented in 1900, it was produced continually for almost 100 years by several makers with production ending in 1998. It features a distinctive high rear end, earning it the nickname \"Humpback\". The top of the action goes straight back on a level with the barrel before cutting down sharply towards the buttstock. This distinctive feature makes it easy to identify A-5s from a distance. A-5s were produced in a variety of gauges, with 12 and 20 predominating; 16 gauge (not produced between 1976 and 1987) models were also available. The shotgun saw [[military]] service worldwide from [[World War I]] through the [[Vietnam War.]] The weapon was used heavily by members of the [[Special Air Service]] in the Malayan Emergency, who found the semi-automatic shotgun perfect for close quarter jungle fighting. \r\n\r\nh4.

Lyon and 58 suburban municipalities have formed since 2015 the Metropolis of Lyon, a directly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of most urban issues, with a population of 1,411,571 in 2019. Lyon is the prefecture of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region and seat of the Departmental Council of Rhône (whose jurisdiction, however, no longer extends over the Metropolis of Lyon since 2015).\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Gauls during the Roman Empire, Lyon is the seat of an archbishopric whose holder bears the title of Primate of the Gauls. Lyon became a major economic hub during the Renaissance. The city is recognised for its cuisine and gastronomy, as well as historical and architectural landmarks; as such, the districts of Old Lyon, the Fourvière hill, the Presqu'île and the slopes of the Croix-Rousse are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema since Auguste and Louis Lumière invented the cinematograph there. The city is also known for its light festival, the Fête des Lumières, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of \"Capital of Lights\". \r\n\r\nh4.

It is also called NSPUM (НСПУМ) or NSPU-1. The scope was introduced into Soviet [[military]] service in the early 1970s and is still used by many of the Soviet Union's successor states, and has been used in numerous armed conflicts around the world.\r\n\r\nThe 1PN58 gathers light into a refractor which can be protected with an aperture cover. The center of the cover has a circular aperture with dark glass allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier. For zeroing the sight the left side of the scope has two perpendicular knobs, of which the elevation knob has a detachable scale. The scope comes with seven different, detachable elevation scales, one for each of the supported weapons. Its magnification power is 3.5×.\r\n\r\nAny [[weapon]] fitted with the Soviet-style dovetail mount can technically use this optic. The following weapons can use the 1PN58, such as:\r\n* [[AKM]]\r\n* [[AK-74]]\r\n* AK-100 series \r\n* [[AS Val]]\r\n* [[Dragunov SVD]] and SVDK\r\n* [[PKM]]\r\n* [[PSL Romak]]\r\n* [[RPG-7]]\r\n* [[RPK-74]] and RPK-74M\r\n* [[VSS Vintorez]]\r\n* [[Zastava M76]]\r\n\r\nh4.
