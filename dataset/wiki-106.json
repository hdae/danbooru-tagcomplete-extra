Other users began ironically making MADs starring Hisui, which would then get added into Ants's rankings, which would then cause more people to watch them. This began the \"Unprecedented HSI姉貴 Boom\" where derivative characters with almost no connection to anything Hisui herself ever did were made. \r\n\r\nThis rapid escalation also caused a number of running jokes. One that carried over from Reisen is fake or detachable ears, except that Hisui's aren't and ends with her comedically spewing blood everywhere.

Both he and [[Horikawa Kunihiro]] are personifications of swords that belonged to [[Hijikata Toshizou]] of the [[Shinsengumi]]. He was asked to be made after the Shinsengumi started to become well known, and Hijikata thus sought after a swordsmith from the Kanesada school, requesting that his new sword be similar to his [[wakizashi]] (Horikawa). This is likely the reason why Izumi-no-kami and Horikawa have the same hair and eye color. He is still around today, located in the Hijikata Toshizou Museum in his hometown of Hino, [[Tokyo (city)|]].\r\n\r\nh4. Appearance\r\n[tn]See post #1934098 for base form.[/tn]\r\n\r\nHe has [[long hair|long]] [[black hair]] with part of it done in a [[side braid]], and [[blue eyes]]. He typically wears [[earrings]], [[Japanese clothes]], black [[fingerless gloves]], and a [[cape]] with the Shinsengumi's distinctive blue and white pattern. For his [[Izumi-no-kami Kanesada (Kiwame)|Kiwame]] form, he puts his hair up in a [[ponytail]] and wears a white [[headband]], a Shinsengumi [[haori]] and black [[knee boots]]. \r\n\r\nDespite looking like an adult, he is technically the youngest character in the game, being the most recently forged sword as he was made in 1867. Because of this, he often comes across as reckless and a bit overconfident, which is why Horikawa often has to assist him or reign him in. Much of his personality is also inspired by the real-life Hijikata.\r\n\r\nh4.

As many different Nerf guns utilise different types of ammunition, the term 'Nerf dart' specifically refers to small, cylindrical tubes topped with rubber ends that are designed to be a kid-friendly imitation of [[bullet|bullets]] for use in mock firefights.\r\n\r\nThe most universally recognised type of Nerf dart is the \"Elite Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dart], a category of Nerf dart that was first released in 2012 coinciding with the launch of the N-Strike Elite series of Nerf toy guns. The standard Elite Dart is recognised by its [[blue]] cylindrical body and [[orange]] rubber tip, which has a hole inside it, likely to prevent choking if it were to be consumed. \r\n\r\nThese Elite Darts were designed to be direct improvements to the previous 'Streamline Dart', with upgades to their range, aerodynamic stability, and general accuracy. However, they share largely the same flaws as their Streamline predecessor, primarily the hole in the front causing the air in front of the bullet, as it naturally encounters air resistance, to be dragged through the hollow body of the bullet, deforming and thus unbalancing the dart. \r\n\r\nHasbro continues to manufacture these darts in spite of this design flaw in order to assure the safety of children who may consume the bullet accidentally, as despite their resemblance to conventional bullets fired by conventional firearms, Nerf ammunition, like the rest of the brand, is designed for non-lethal play instead of live fire combat. As such, their efficiency in both killing and as a general projectile are not prioritised.\r\n\r\nThe universality of the Elite Dart's design has resulted in many color variants being produced for Nerf toy weapons outside the initial N-Strike Series, such as the \"GlowStrike Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/GlowStrike_Dart] (which would glow in the dark), the \"Message Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Message_Dart] (which was packaged with equipment that allowed for the writing of messages on the dart's body), and the \"Star Wars Dart\":[https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Dart] (a collaboration dart produced for the [[Star Wars]] crossover line which came in [[red]] and [[blue]] colors signifying allegience to the First Order and the Resistance respectively).","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":193724,"created_at":"2024-05-18T10:23:16.046-04:00","updated_at":"2024-05-18T10:23:34.897-04:00","title":"wisps_(mint_fantome)","body":"The representation of [[Mint Fantome]]'s fans.
