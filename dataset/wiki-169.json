Even though G3s were officially classified as battlecruisers in design they were closer to what we would today consider fast battleships; featuring main battery of 9 406mm guns mounted in three triple turrets, 16 155mm secondary guns in 8 twin turrets, 356mm (magazines) to 305mm (machinery spaces) thick armored belt, 203mm to 73mm thick armored deck (areas around magazines being once again significantly more heavily armored than those around machinery spaces), heavily armored turrets  (444mm thick faces, 330mm to 229mm sides, 203mm roof), and armored bulkheads 305mm to 254mm thick, with design speed of 32 knots and full displacement of 54k tons. G3's most notable feature (and the one which allowed to it to as heavily armored as it was) was its rather unorthodox turret placement; 2 turrets (A and B) forward with B turret superfiring over A turret, one turret midship (X), this layout allowed the armor to be concentrated in much smaller area than it would had been possible if a more conventional turret layout had been used.

Her parents were highly sought-after business consultants and coaches for powerful CEOs around the world. Though her parents paid little attention to her (mostly leaving her in the care of the family’s omnic butler, [[bob (overwatch)|Bob]]), they ensured that Ashe had every opportunity to succeed. But a chance meeting with a local ruffian, named [[cassidy (overwatch)|Jesse McCree]], and an impromptu string of crimes committed together opened her eyes to her true calling. The satisfaction of outwitting her targets and the thrill of getting away with it set her on the outlaw path.\r\n\r\nAlong with the other three founders of the Deadlock Gang, Ashe started to make a name for herself with bigger and more extravagant heists. The Deadlock Gang’s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together.\r\n\r\nAshe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). Her principles: keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal.\r\n\r\nNo longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe is now writing her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that has put her at top of the authorities’ most-wanted lists and cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend.\r\n\r\nh4.
