As in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in sight or gun range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier- or land-based aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal was underway with the Battle for Henderson Field while the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of 26 October 1942, just north of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the [[uss_hornet_(cv-8)|fleet carrier Hornet]] sunk, and another fleet carrier, Enterprise, heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses, plus significant damage to the fleet carrier Shōkaku and the light carrier Zuihō.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz was a short-term \"Pyrrhic victory\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, and control of the seas around [[guadalcanal_(island)|Guadalcanal]]. However, Japan's loss of many irreplaceable veteran aircrews proved to be a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low and were quickly replaced. The Japanese had hoped for, and needed, a larger, decisive [[victory]]. The fact that the naval battle was won just after the land battle was lost by the Japanese meant that the opportunity to exploit their success in the battle had already passed.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["南太平洋海戦"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184353,"created_at":"2024-02-11T14:25:12.153-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T19:22:40.996-05:00","title":"para_(vtuber)_(3rd_costume)","body":"The third [[official alternate costume|costume]] of the [[Indie Virtual YouTuber|indie]] [[Para (vtuber)|]], debuting on February 9th, 2024 for her birthday celebration, as seen on \"Twitter\":[https://twitter.com/wwparasiVT/status/1757084126056771631].\r\n\r\nHer formerly [[long hair]] has been cut [[short hair|short]], and her bangs trimmed [[blunt bangs|straight]].\r\n\r\nShe now wears a [[white shirt|white]] [[blouse]] with an [[off shoulder]] [[pink sweater|sweater]] that reaches past her [[sleeves past wrists|wrists]], a [[red bow|red]] [[plaid]] [[bowtie]], a [[blue skirt|blue]] [[pleated skirt]], [[leg warmers]], and [[bunny slippers]] stylized to match herself.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184351,"created_at":"2024-02-11T13:11:49.356-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T19:22:39.167-05:00","title":"para_(vtuber)_(2nd_costume)","body":"The second [[official alternate costume|costume]] of the [[Indie Virtual YouTuber|indie]] [[Para (vtuber)|]], which debuted on October 28, 2023, as seen on \"Twitter\":[https://twitter.com/wwparasiVT/status/1718408767396556819].\r\n\r\nConsists of a [[white shirt]] with [[sleeves past fingers|sleeves]] past her fingers worn under a [[blue dress|blue]] [[denim]] dress with two [[buttons]] and an [[food print|image]] of a [[leek]]. \r\n\r\nShe now also has large [[backpack]] filled with various pieces of [[meat]] and a [[bone]] sticking out from it, she also added a pair of [[yellow footwear|yellow]] [[rubber boots|rain boots]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184387,"created_at":"2024-02-12T01:36:43.253-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T19:15:10.423-05:00","title":"tabinoki_kanae_(2nd_costume)","body":"The second [[official alternate costume|costume]] of the [[Indie Virtual YouTuber|indie]] [[Tabinoki Kanae]], as seen in post #7205636.\r\n\r\nFor this look, he wears a [[black headwear|black]] [[beret]], with [[black capelet|black]] [[fur-trimmed capelet]] worn over a [[black shirt]], [[black shorts|black]] [[suspender shorts]] and [[black footwear|black]] [[fur-trimmed boots]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":167913,"created_at":"2023-07-02T04:03:59.891-04:00","updated_at":"2024-02-15T18:56:34.872-05:00","title":"shisui_kiki_(2nd_costume)","body":"The second [[official alternate costume|costume]] of [[Nanashi Inc.]]'s [[Shisui Kiki]], as seen on \"Twitter\":[https://twitter.com/Kiki_Shisui/status/1629523483276480512].\r\n\r\nShe retains her [[ahoge]] and [[cowlick]], but now has [[medium bangs|medium-length]] [[blunt bangs]] and a [[black headwear|black]] [[beret]].

The Tiger I design gave the Wehrmacht its first tank mounting the 88 mm gun, in its initial armored fighting vehicle-dedicated version, which in its [[88_flak|Flak version]] had previously demonstrated its effectiveness against both air and ground targets. During the course of the war, the Tiger I saw combat on all German battlefronts. It was usually deployed in independent tank battalions, which proved to be quite formidable. However, it was over-engineered and prone to mechanical breakdowns and faults, making it unreliable and causing many Tigers to be lost outside of combat. The overlapping wheel system in particular was extremely hard to perform field repairs on.\r\n\r\nThe tank was given its nickname \"Tiger\" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the later [[Tiger II]] entered production. The initial official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (‘Panzer VI version H’, abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H), but the tank was redesignated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. E in March 1943.

Traditionally, Guan Yu is portrayed as a red-faced warrior with a [[long beard]] wearing a [[green robe]] over his [[Chinese armor|body armor]]. Guan Yu's weapon was a [[guan dao]] named Green Dragon Crescent Blade, which resembled a [[glaive (polearm)|glaive]] and was said to weigh 82 catties (about 49.2 kg or 108.4674 lbs).\r\n\r\nAlong with [[Zhang Fei]], he shared a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and accompanied him on most of his early exploits. Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei's state of [[Shu Han]] during the [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms|Three Kingdoms period]]. While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei, he is also known for repaying [[Cao Cao|Cao Cao's]] kindness by slaying [[Yan Liang]], a general under Cao Cao's rival [[Yuan Shao]], at the Battle of Boma. After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214, Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years. In 219, while he was away fighting Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Fancheng, Liu Bei's ally [[Sun Quan]] broke the Sun–Liu alliance and sent his general [[Lu Meng|Lü Meng]] to conquer Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. By the time Guan Yu found out about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng, it was too late. He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan's forces and executed.\r\n\r\nGuan Yu's was deified during the [[Sui dynasty]]. His deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis, making Guan Yu one of East Asia's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness. He is still worshipped by many Chinese people today. In religious devotion, he is reverentially called the \"Emperor Guan\" (Guān Dì) or \"Lord Guan\" (Guān Gōng). He is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk religion, popular [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]], and small shrines to him are almost ubiquitous in traditional Chinese shops and restaurants. \r\n\r\nh5.

He secured the throne and established a powerful Xiongnu Empire by successfully unifying the tribes of the Mongolian-Manchurian grassland in response to the loss of Xiongnu pasture lands to invading [[Qin dynasty|Qin forces]] commanded by Meng Tian in 215 BCE. While Modu rode and then furthered the wave of militarization and effectively centralized Xiongnu power, the Qin quickly fell into disarray with the death of the first emperor in 210 BCE, leaving Modu a free hand to expand his Xiongnu Empire into one of the largest of his time. The eastern border stretched as far as the Liao River, the western borders of the empire reached the Pamir Mountains, whilst the northern border reached Lake Baikal.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["冒頓単于"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184519,"created_at":"2024-02-13T23:34:17.124-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-13T23:34:58.266-05:00","title":"transformers_operation_combination","body":"The final installment of the classic portion of the Japanese G1 timeline of the [[Transformers]] franchise.

However, several of the states were founded by the Han people, and all of the states—whether ruled by Xiongnu, Xianbei, Di, Jie, Qiang, Han, or others—took on Han-style dynastic names. The states frequently fought against both one another and the Eastern Jin dynasty, which succeeded the Western Jin in 317 and ruled southern China. The period ended with the unification of northern China in 439 by the Northern Wei, a dynasty established by the Xianbei Tuoba clan. This occurred 19 years after the Eastern Jin collapsed in 420, and was replaced by the Liu Song dynasty. Following the unification of the north by [[Northern Wei]], the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] era of Chinese history began.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["五胡十六国"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184499,"created_at":"2024-02-13T17:43:36.233-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-13T17:43:36.233-05:00","title":"spring_and_autumn","body":"The Spring and Autumn period or Chunqiu (春秋) in Chinese history lasted from approximately 770 to 481 BC (or later) which corresponds roughly to the first half of the Eastern Zhou period.\r\n\r\nThe period's name derives from the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 481 BCE, which tradition associates with [[Confucius]]. During this period, royal control over the various local polities eroded as regional lords increasingly exercised political autonomy, negotiating their own alliances, waging wars amongst themselves, up to defying the king's court in Luoyi. The gradual Partition of Jin, one of the most powerful states, is generally considered to mark the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["春秋"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184496,"created_at":"2024-02-13T16:35:23.177-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-13T16:35:32.267-05:00","title":"liu_bang","body":"[b]Emperor Gaozu[/b] of Han (漢高祖) given name [b]Liu Bang[/b] (劉邦), courtesy name Ji (季), was the founder and first emperor of the [[Han dynasty]], reigning from 202 to 195 BC.

It sported a unique double delta planform, the inner delta also forming the air intake trunks for its single turbojet. Aside from its 30mm cannon, it could carry up to 4,082 kg (9,000 lb) of rockets, bombs, and air-to-air missiles. It was replaced by the [[Saab Gripen]] in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nDue to its tailless delta configuration, the Draken was plagued by critical instability and was prone to \"super-stalls\", which claimed the lives of many test pilots. However, when training to recover from a super-stall, its pilots realized the plane was capable of rapidly lifting its nose to an almost vertical level, then recover after applying power and negative controls with minimal loss in altitude. This maneuver would later become known in Swedish as the \"kort parad\" (short parade in English), but to the rest of the world, it would receive the nickname of \"[[cobra maneuver|Swedish Cobra]]\".\r\n\r\nh4.

Both the arcade system and console were very very powerful for the time and the AES allowed for perfect ports of 2D games released for the arcade MVS with superior colors and sound. \r\n\r\nHowever, the equally very very high price point for both the console and its games prevented it from directly competing with its contemporaries, the [[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[super_nintendo|Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].\r\n\r\nYears later, SNK would release the Neo Geo CD, a more cost effective console with games released on compact discs. The console was met with limited success, due in part to its slow CD-ROM drive. \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to compete with increasingly popular 3D games, SNK released the Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade system in 1997 as the successor to its aging MVS. The system did not fare well and only a few titles were released for it. A planned home console based on the hardware was never released. \r\n\r\nSNK later extended the brand by releasing two handheld consoles, the Neo Geo Pocket and Neo Geo Pocket Color, which briefly competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. Soon after their release, SNK encountered various legal and financial issues and the Neo Geo brand was officially discontinued in 2004.\r\n\r\nDespite the failure of later Neo Geo hardware, games for the original MVS and AES were very well received. The system spawned several long-running series, including [[The King of Fighters]] and [[Samurai Spirits|Samurai Shodown]]. Later releases like the [[Metal Slug]] games ensured that the hardware had quite a long lifespan. \r\n\r\nHomebrew video games for the system have also been released and the AES system along with its games are popular among collectors, with many AES items still fetching high prices at auction. In 2012, SNK Playmore announced that it was revisiting the brand with a handheld console based on the original AES, under the name [i]Neo Geo X[/i].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ネオジオ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":184009,"created_at":"2024-02-07T03:15:05.130-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-07T03:15:05.130-05:00","title":"mercy_killing_(vocaloid)","body":"A song by the producer [[Iyowa (igusuri please)|]] featuring [[Hatsune Miku]] and [[flower (vocaloid)|]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Situated in the camargue region of southern France, it is located on the coast of the Gulf of Lion, part of the Mediterranean Sea, near the mouth of the Rhône river. Its inhabitants are called Marseillais.\r\n\r\nMarseille is the second most populous city in France, with 870,731 inhabitants in 2019 (Jan. census) over a municipal territory of 241 km2 (93 sq mi). Together with its suburbs and exurbs, the Marseille metropolitan area, which extends over 3,972 km2 (1,534 sq mi), had a population of 1,873,270 at the Jan. 2019 census, the third most populated in France after those of Paris and Lyon. The cities of Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, and 90 suburban municipalities have formed since 2016 the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis, an indirectly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of wider metropolitan issues, with a population of 1,898,561 at the Jan. 2019 census.\r\n\r\nFounded around 600 BC by Greek settlers from Phocaea, Marseille is the oldest city in [[France]], as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements. It was known to the ancient Greeks as Massalia and to Romans as Massilia. Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the Old Port still lies at the heart of the city where the manufacturing of soap, its famous savon de Marseille, began some 6 centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde or \"Bonne-mère\" for the people of Marseille, a Romano-Byzantine church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port. Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a cosmopolitan city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after [[London]] and [[Paris]].\r\n\r\nh4. Landmarks\r\n* [[Notre Dame de la Garde]]\r\n* [[Vieux-Port de Marseille]]\r\n\r\nh4.
