He is based on the historical Amakusa, a Christian rebel who led a revolt that met an untimely defeat at Shimabara.\r\n\r\nIn Samurai Spirits, he is possessed by Ambrosia moments after the abovementioned event, dying, becoming an antagonist. After being defeated, his soul splits into two-- the evil Ambrosia-influenced side, later exterminated by the Kagama siblings Kazuki and Sogetsu, and his actual heroic and good side, who lives on to his originally good ways. It is this good side that saved [[Haoumaru]] and company in the events of the second Samurai Spirits game, before being defeated ultimately by Ambrosia.\r\n\r\nHis name is often misinterpreted; Shirou is his given name, while Amakusa is his surname or family name. Additionally, due to his clothes and sometimes voice, he is, in the past, mistaken for a female.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["天草四郎時貞"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":158906,"created_at":"2023-02-17T19:56:36.437-05:00","updated_at":"2023-03-01T15:07:34.694-05:00","title":"welrod_mkii_(nightfall_crisis)_(girls'_frontline)","body":"[[Welrod

rabbinic literature Lilith is variously depicted as the mother of Adam’s demonic offspring following his separation from Eve or as his first wife. Whereas Eve was created from Adam’s rib (Genesis 2:22), some accounts hold that Lilith was the woman implied in Genesis 1:27 and was made from the same soil as Adam. Insolently refusing to be subservient to her husband, Lilith left Adam and the perfection of the Garden of Eden; three angels tried in vain to force her return. According to some mythologies, her demonic offspring were sired by an archangel named Samael and were not Adam’s progeny.\"\r\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Lilith-Jewish-folklore\r\n\r\n\"Lilith represents something that has become unconscious and is striving to become conscious again. Let’s call it archaic energy, spiritual femininity, something akin to the wisdom of the goddess. As long as we don’t have access to this energy we experience it psychologically as loss, suppression, isolation, emptiness, addiction and above all power struggles.\"\r\n-Hannelore Traugott\r\n\r\n\"Lilith is a fictitious second moon of Earth, supposedly about the same mass as the Earth's Moon, proposed in 1918 by astrologer Walter Gorn Old, who called himself Sepharial.\r\n\r\nIn present-day astrology, the name Black Moon Lilith is usually given to a point on the horoscope of the actual moon's apogee. When considered as a point, this Lilith is sometimes defined as the second focus of the ellipse described by the Moon's orbit; the earth is the first focus, and the apogee lies in the same direction. It takes 8 years and 10 months to complete its circuit around the zodiac.\"\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_objects_proposed_in_religion,_astrology,_ufology_and_pseudoscience#Lilith\r\nhttps://www.astro.com/astrology/ivccn_article190722_e.htm\r\n\r\n\"The depiction of Lilith in Romanticism continues to be popular among Wiccans and in other modern Occultism. A few magical orders dedicated to the undercurrent of Lilith, featuring initiations specifically related to the arcana of the \"first mother\", exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gerald Gardner asserted that there was continuous historical worship of Lilith to present day, and that her name is sometimes given to the goddess being personified in the coven by the priestess. This idea was further attested by Doreen Valiente, who cited her as a presiding goddess of the Craft: \"the personification of erotic dreams, the suppressed desire for delights\".  In some contemporary concepts, Lilith is viewed as the embodiment of the Goddess, a designation that is thought to be shared with what these faiths believe to be her counterparts: Inanna, Ishtar, Asherah, Anath, Anahita and Isis.  According to one view, Lilith was originally a Sumerian, Babylonian, or Hebrew mother goddess of childbirth, children, women, and sexuality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Raymond Buckland holds that Lilith is a dark moon goddess on par with the Hindu Kali.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some Satanists believe that she is the wife of Satan and thus think of her as a mother figure. A different approach to a Satanic Lilith holds that she was once a fertility and agricultural goddess.\"\r\n\r\n\"The western mystery tradition associates Lilith with the Qliphoth of kabbalah. Dion Fortune writes, \"The Virgin Mary is reflected in Lilith\", and that Lilith is the source of \"lustful dreams\".\"\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith#In_Western_esotericism_and_modern_occultism\r\n\r\n\"In the Babylonian and Hebrew lunisolar calendars, the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long (13-month) years of the Metonic cycle.

Clarke's novels are notable for including several scientific facts and logical predictions that have proven true over the course of time and the advancements in technology. For many years [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Isaac Asimov]], and Clarke were known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction literature.\r\n\r\nClarke also served in the Royal Air Force as a radar instructor and technician from 1941 to 1946. In 1945, he proposed a [[satellite]] communication system, an idea that, in 1963, won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1947 to 1950 and again in 1953.\r\n\r\nIn 1956, Clarke emigrated to Sri Lanka, largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving. That year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death.
