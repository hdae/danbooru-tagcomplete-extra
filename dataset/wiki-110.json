A clover clamp is not limited to clamping nipples, although this is the most commonly drawn use in art.\r\n\r\nNote: tag uses the singular \"clamp\" instead of plural form \"clamps\", since using a single clamp is seen frequently as well. Single clamps are typically for more extreme predicament and [[humiliation]] than for nipple play in [[BDSM]].\r\n\r\n(Full entry below includes text originally adapted from Wikipedia. Providing this note for reference to borrowed definition text from the article \"Nipple clamp, under the 'Clover clamp' section\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple_clamp#Clover_clamp])\r\n\r\nThe clover clamp, also referred to as \"butterfly clamp\" or \"bird clamp\" is of Japanese origin and was designed for clamping sails or sewing fabric. The clamp is flat, about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide, and has an eyelet to which a chain or cord can be attached. If this is pulled a mechanism inside the clamp moves the jaws closer together and provides increasing tension. When they are applied to the nipples a spring hinge holds them in place under tension and provides a very high pain level.They are used for [[nipple torture]] in the BDSM community.\r\n\r\nTo increase the tension on the nipples, small weights are sometimes attached to the clamps or the chain. These can be weights designed specifically for this purpose or weights such as fishing sinkers can be used.\r\n\r\nAnother use for the clamps is to keep a person in one place. If a cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move.\r\n\r\nThis technique can be used for [[predicament bondage]]. The removal of the clamps is also painful and different methods of removal can increase or decrease this pain.\r\n\r\nThese clamps have small points of contact and hence their pinch is usually painful, especially on people with larger nipples. They are usually only used by more experienced users for the purposes of [[edging]], [[orgasm denial]] or [[nipple torture]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["butterfly_clamp","Japanese_clamp","bird_clamp"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129999,"created_at":"2021-11-05T00:12:34.960-04:00","updated_at":"2023-06-05T07:33:19.496-04:00","title":"ishikawa_ken","body":"Ken Ishikawa (石川賢, Ishikawa Ken, June 28, 1948 – November 15, 2006) was a Japanese manga artist.

It is often accompanied by [[picnic|picnicking]], drinking, and other activities. \r\n\r\nThe appeal of viewing tree blossoms itself is found in the very brief period of flowering, which lasts seldom over a week before the petals have all fallen, and the leaves of their trees begin to sprout. This is considered a symbolic motif representing the beauty and impermanence of life. Owing to the cultural significance of the practice, Japan's national weather service keeps an annual forecast to inform the public as to when cherry trees are predicted to blossom. \r\n\r\nViewing plum blossoms (ume) is an older practice which started in the Nara period, and was eclipsed during the Heian period by the popularity of viewing cherry blossoms. Many older Japanese today prefer ume viewing (sometimes known as 梅見, [i]umemi[/i]), as they find that sakura viewing parties may be too crowded and raucous. \r\n\r\nh4.

Some members of the Chinese diaspora (i.e. Overseas Chinese) in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines (and also some older members of the Chinese communities in San Francisco, Los Angeles and NYC) may also use a form of Minnan as their mother tongue.\r\n\r\nThe term [i]Minnan[/i] is generally used to refer to Quanzhang and Zhangzhou variants of Minnan, and descendants thereof. Minnan can also technically refer to other varieties of Southern Min (e.g. Teochew (Chaozhou)), but this use will be excluded for the purposes of this wiki (and tagging on Danbooru).\r\n\r\nSpeakers of Minnan often have their own preferred way to refer to it: this includes Fujianhua, Fujianese, Fukien, Taigi, Holo, Hokkien, etc. The choice of which term to use can be fraught with... [i]political issues[/i], and as such \"Minnan\" is frequently used as a more neutral term that most speakers can understand as referring to the Quanzhang and Zhangzhou variants of Minnan (and descendants).\r\n\r\nFor Danbooru purposes (i.e. considering the demographics of the artists whose works are likely to be uploaded by users), most examples of Minnan text are likely to be in a Taiwanese variant of Minnan. These will usually be written in [[Traditional Chinese Text|Traditional Chinese]] characters (with occasional [[bopomofo_text]]), and mixed in with (sometimes accented) Mandarin Chinese (also written in Traditional Chinese). Minnan written in this way makes frequent use of Chinese characters chosen only for their phonetic values to approximate the pronunciations of Minnan, or to act as euphenisms.\r\n\r\nMainland Chinese artists who write in Minnan are also likely to mix Minnan with Mandarin Chinese (and employ similar euphemisms), but the text will be written in Simplified Chinese characters instead.\r\n\r\nArtists from Singapore and Malaysia tend to write in English, but some (particularly those of Chinese descent) may also insert certain Minnan phrases, written using the Latin alphabet. These tend to be profanity. Minnan is... well-known for having a rich vocabulary of colorful phrases.\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n* The above article has been written carefully in a certain way to avoid triggering political sensibilities. This may have resulted in the article using language that is less clear than ideal.\r\n** In particular, usage of the... 'D' and 'L' words are avoided.\r\n** The article (and tag) also uses the term Minnan, a more neutral term.\r\n** As such, be careful if one chooses to rewrite or edit this wiki.\r\n\r\nh4. Notable artists\r\n* [[Hi Ye]]\r\n** Taiwanese artist.\r\n** Character speech in comics are usually written in Mandarin Chinese (using Traditional Chinese characters). \r\n** Characters may sometimes switch to accented Mandarin or Minnan in more emotional moments.\r\n** This distinction is lost in the Japanese translations of the comics.\r\n\r\n* [[Guin Guin]]\r\n** Malaysian artist.\r\n** Character speech in comics are usually written in English.\r\n** Characters (particularly those of implied Chinese descent) may sometimes insert Minnan phrases (written using the Latin alphabet) in more emotional moments.\r\n\r\nh4.
