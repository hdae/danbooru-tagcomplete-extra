To preserve Japan's territories, coastal cities sprung up, one after the other. Eventually, they became marine cities, and along with the expansion of sea-lanes to connect them, the need arose for a sizable staff to protect the seas.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, maritime jobs were becoming more popular among women. Hence, the Blue Mermaids, tasked with keeping the seas safe, had become every female student's dream job. This is when childhood friends Akeno Misaki and Moeka China enroll in a marine high school in Yokosuka, along with other girls who share their goal of becoming a Blue Mermaid.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nh4.

The physical component for [[Alice Margatroid]]'s spellcard \"Eerily Luminous Shanghai Doll\" in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]] / [[Immaterial and Missing Power]], as well as her familiar in [[Imperishable Night]].\r\n\r\nShanghai is a very popular supporting character (or artifact) in [[Touhou]] fan art depicting Alice.\r\n\r\nSome comic artists give the [[doll]] a personality and feelings of its own, making it a \"master doll\" that helps control the lesser dolls. Others show it as Alice's primary magically-controlled \"puppet\". These points of view can be mixed, possibly to give an impression of Alice \"debating with herself\" through doll use, reminiscent of the way ventriloquists use puppets. Sometimes she/it is even depicted as lacking \"doll\" traits entirely, resembling a [[minigirl]].\r\n\r\nAnother view is that Shanghai is a type or class of magical dolls rather than an individual doll. This is based on the fact that several Shanghai dolls are seen simultaneously in [[Perfect Cherry Blossom]].\r\n\r\nCanonically, Shanghai, like all the rest of Alice's dolls, is a mindless drone that requires direct supervision for all but the most basic of autonomous action, despite Alice's ongoing efforts to create a truly sapient construct. When a fanwork depicts Alice finally succeeding, Shanghai is usually the subject.\r\n\r\nh4. See also\r\n\r\n* [[matching Shanghai]]\r\n* [[Hourai Doll]]\r\n* [[Goliath Doll]]\r\n\r\nh4.

ADV Films licensed the series for North American distribution, releasing the series across the region, with the first DVD volume release being published on June 22, 2005 and the last volume being released on January 17, 2006.\r\n\r\nAn horizontal scrolling shoot'em up [[video game]] by [[Capcom]] was released in the arcades in 1989.
