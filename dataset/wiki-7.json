Personality\r\n\r\nIn-game, she has a generically friendly and reliable personality. She consistently refers to the admiral and other shipgirls as \"Comrades\", conforming to the communist model. In fan-art, the fact that she was built in Italy is rarely shown unless this is directly refered to, often making her the zealous, \"more communist than thou\" character compared to newcomer [[hibiki (kancolle)|Hibiki]]/[[verniy (kancolle)|Verniy]] and imperial-era old guard [[Gangut (kancolle)|]]. On the opposite end, you can have \"the sweetest Tashkent around\":[/pools/14819].\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nThe Tashkent class of ships consisted of a single destroyer leader, built in Italy for the Soviet navy just before World War II. Three other ships were ordered but canceled before construction. The class is named after Tashkent, \"the capital city\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent] of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (now Uzbekistan).\r\n\r\nh4. Trivia\r\n\r\nThe real life destroyer Tashkent had a top speed of 43 knots, technically making her faster than [[Shimakaze (destroyer)|]] but slower than the French destroyer [[Le Terrible (destroyer)|Le Terrible]]. With that in mind, she is currently the fastest destroyer implemented in game.\r\n\r\nh4.

Simplified: 春丽) is a character in the [[Street Fighter]] series by [[Capcom]]. She is the first female playable character to appear in a 1-on-1 fighting game.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in [[Street Fighter II (series)|]], Chun-Li was the youngest member of the roster and only female character in the game, the self-proclaimed \"strongest woman in the world,\" and while not as physically powerful as the other characters, she was by far the quickest. Her most famous attack is the [i]Hyakuretsukyaku[/i] (\"Hundred Crack Legs\", alternately known as \"Lightning Legs\"), where she repeatedly kicks her opponent from a tilted standing position with incredible speed.\r\n\r\nIn the Street Fighter series, Chun-Li was an Interpol investigator from [[China]] who had been searching for clues to the recent death of her father. Getting into a friendly spar with an old teacher of hers and friend of her father, [[Gen (street fighter)|]], he gives her a lead into who may have killed her father—the mysterious crime syndicate Shadaloo and its tyrannical leader [[M. Bison]]. After an encounter where M. Bison confirms he slew her father, a tearful Chun-Li swore vengeance and made it her life's mission to destroy Shadaloo and bring M. Bison to justice. She collaborated closely with [[Guile]], [[Cammy White]], [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|]], and the other World Warriors throughout the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter M. Bison's supposedly final death during [[Street Fighter V]], her mission complete, Chun-Li retired from Interpol and opened an orphanage to live a quieter life. The most famous of her young wards - practically her adopted daughter - is [[Li-Fen]].\r\n\r\nChun-Li is one of Capcom's most popular characters and one of the most important females in video game history, appearing in numerous cross-overs and promotions. Her oldest and arguably greatest cross-company rival is [[SNK]]'s [[Fatal Fury]]'s [[Shiranui Mai|Mai Shiranui]].\r\n\r\nh4.

Her image color is orange-ish yellow and her character item is a cell phone. Her design was created by [[Smith Hioka|Smith Hioka (スミス･ヒオカ)]] in 2007. Neru is sometimes written as a Miku wannabe, others as the anti-hero of the Vocaloid personage. She has been officially recognized as a [[Hatsune Miku|Miku]] derivative by Crypton since 2008.\r\n\r\nIn the West, she's largely remembered for her appearance in [[Triple Baka (Vocaloid)|]]. She would once more return to prominence in 2024 as a result of a meme relating to [[Mesmerizer (Vocaloid)|]], due to a reply to a tweet reminiscing about Triple Baka, where Neru was called \"\"the yellow one that doesn't appear in Mesmerizer\":[https://twitter.com/FailedDumbFuck/status/1800938120416010623]\".

The war is therefore considered a [[Cold War]]-era proxy war.\r\n\r\nThe [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (known in the West by the insult \"Viet Cong\", or VC, meaning \"Red Vietnamese\"), a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North, fought a [[guerrilla]] war against anti-communist forces in the region, while the [[People's Army of Vietnam]], also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in more conventional warfare, at times committing large units to battle. \r\n\r\nAmerican involvement in the war peaked in 1968, the same year that the communist side launched the Tet Offensive. The Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government, but became the turning point in the war, as it persuaded a large segment of the U.S. population that its government's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam. \r\n\r\nDirect U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973, leaving South Vietnam's own military, the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]], to fight on alone. \r\n\r\nThe capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year under a communist government. \r\n\r\nEstimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million. Some 240,000–300,000 Cambodians, 20,000–62,000 Laotians and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.\r\n\r\nh4.

The kyuu guntou were used from 1875 until 1934.  Their production was not standardized, with different craftsmen producing them.  Many styles closely resembled European and American [[saber_(weapon)|sabres]] of the time.  The shin guntou were used from 1935 until 1945.  Most of these were produced in the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal and were based on traditional slung [[tachi_(weapon)|]] of the Kamakura Period (1185–1332).\r\n\r\nThese swords were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]].

Independent of the Mega Drive, the 32X utilizes its own ROM cartridges and had its own library of games. \r\n\r\nUnveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the 32X as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games...\". The product was originally conceived as an entirely new console by [[Sega]] of Japan and positioned as an inexpensive alternative for gamers into the fifth generation of game consoles, but at the suggestion of Sega of America, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Mega Drive and made more powerful, with two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. \r\n\r\nDespite these changes, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the following year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a weak library of titles. With sales only reaching as high as 665,000 units, the 32X is still considered a commercial failure.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["スーパー32X"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":225241,"created_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:48.166-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:48.166-05:00","title":"ganesha_(danmachi)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ガネーシャ(ダンまち)"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":64003,"created_at":"2015-04-04T00:19:29.299-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-08T01:50:18.549-05:00","title":"dungeon_ni_deai_wo_motomeru_no_wa_machigatteiru_darou_ka","body":"[b]Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka?[/b] (lit.

Luffy]]'s transformations from [[One Piece]].\r\n\r\nLuffy coats his arm in [[Haki]] before biting into his forearm. Similar to how he activates [[Gear Third]], he blows an incredible amount of air into his body, but this time he inflates his muscular structure before distributing the air throughout his body, with emphasis on his upper half. If Luffy is stopped mid-blowing, the arm will slowly deflate.\r\n\r\nWhen utilizing [[Gear Fourth]], Luffy makes extensive usage of his [[Haki]] by coating his arms, legs and much of his torso in it to the point that they turn black from hardening. The Haki coating across his body resembles the wispy ends made from flames, giving it the appearance of tattoos, and he gains shading around the inner and outer edges of his eyes. He also physically grows taller, standing around 4 meters tall. Similar to when using [[Gear Second]], Luffy is continuously emitting steam in this form. Combined with Luffy's rubbery composition and his compressed muscle structure, [[Gear Fourth]] both adds explosive power to Luffy's attacks and grants him enhanced defensive capabilities far beyond what he can demonstrate with or without [[Gear Second]] or [[Gear Third]].

She had done a lot to conform to her fiancée's wishes of an ideal woman and thought time together would bridge their feelings.

On Danbooru, [b]they are written in \"present participle\":http://www.edufind.com/english/grammar/present_participle.php to denote that a character is doing something at that moment in the image.[/b] The action might be a freeze frame for us (unless it's an animated image), but it is occurring for them in the present and should be tagged as such. A lot of verbs are written in the present tense for this reason, many ending with -ing. If you can also call that verb an object, it should be listed in the gerunds category.

A verb written in -ing form can be turned into a subject or noun depending on how the sentence is structured. For instance, let's use the sentence, \"Tagging images on Danbooru helps to narrow down a search\". The gerund here is [i]tagging[/i] because it is being treated as the subject rather than the action; the actual verb here is [i]helps[/i] because it is describing how useful tagging is.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, and mainly for this site, an -ing verb can also refer to an actual object, not just a verb being turned into a subject. Examples including [i]building[/i] (the act of constructing something vs. the actual structure itself), [i]drawing[/i] (the act of doodling on paper vs. the completed picture itself), or [i]wedding[/i] (the act of being wed vs. the ceremony). [b]If you're able to call an -ing word both a verb and a noun, it should fall under this list as a gerund.[/b] Many of these gerunds already have the -ing verb aliased to them, and their wikis often have the phrases, \"As a verb, it is the act of...\" followed by, \"As a noun...\" to clarify the term both as an action and an object.\r\n\r\nh5.List of tagged gerunds\r\n\r\n* [[battle]] (battling)\r\n* [[bleeding]]\r\n* [[blowing]]\r\n* [[bowling]]\r\n* [[boxing]]\r\n* [[mind control]]\r\n* [[breast padding]]\r\n* [[building]]\r\n** [[model building]]\r\n* [[bullfighting]]\r\n* [[burning]]\r\n* [[camping]]\r\n* [[carving]]\r\n* [[cheating (relationship)|]]\r\n* [[clapping]]\r\n* [[cling]] (clinging)\r\n** [[breast clinging]]\r\n* [[crossdressing]]\r\n* [[dating]]\r\n** [[2D dating]]\r\n* [[dissolving]]\r\n* [[drawing (action)]]\r\n** [[drawing (object)]]\r\n** [[child's drawing]]\r\n* [[drowning]]\r\n* [[face stretching]]\r\n* [[fading]]\r\n* [[fencing]]\r\n* [[fishing]]\r\n* [[flashing]]\r\n** [[mooning]]\r\n** [[streaking]]\r\n* [[flexing]]\r\n* [[foreshortening]]\r\n* [[frottage]]\r\n* [[goldfish scooping]]\r\n* [[grilling]]\r\n* [[hiking]]\r\n* [[hitchhiking]]\r\n* [[horseback riding]]\r\n* [[kidnapping]]\r\n* [[kiss]]\r\n* [[knitting]]\r\n* [[marching]]\r\n* [[masturbation]]\r\n* [[misunderstanding]]\r\n* [[mixed-sex bathing]]\r\n* [[mooning]]\r\n* [[painting (action)|]]\r\n** [[drawing on another's face]]\r\n* [[panicking]]\r\n* [[pose]] (posing)\r\n* [[pout]]\r\n* [[racing]]\r\n* [[recording]]\r\n* [[shipping (fandom)|]]\r\n* [[rotting]]\r\n* [[rowing]]\r\n* [[scolding]]\r\n** [[lecturing]]\r\n* [[sewing]]\r\n* [[shoplifting]]\r\n* [[skating]]\r\n** [[figure skating]]\r\n** [[ice skating]]\r\n* [[skiing]]\r\n* [[slapping]]\r\n* [[smother]]\r\n* [[stalking]]\r\n* [[straddling]]\r\n** [[pillow straddling]]\r\n** [[thigh straddling]]\r\n* [[swimming]]\r\n** [[freediving]]\r\n* [[tail wagging]]\r\n* [[theft]] (stealing)\r\n* [[tribadism]]\r\n* [[unbirthing]]\r\n* [[voyeurism]]\r\n* [[wedding]]\r\n* [[welding]]\r\n* [[wrestling]]\r\n** [[arm wrestling]]\r\n* [[writing]]\r\n* [[yawning]]\r\n\r\nh4.Ambiguous\r\n\r\nFor tags that may fall in one category, but further discussion is required to define which one.\r\n\r\n* [[bullying]]\r\n* [[egg laying]]\r\n* [[pegging]]\r\n* [[penises touching]]\r\n* [[pipelining]]\r\n* [[sounding]]\r\n* [[symmetrical docking]]\r\n** [[asymmetrical docking]]\r\n* [[prostate milking]]\r\n* [[squatting]]\r\n* [[taunting]]\r\n* [[teasing]]\r\n\r\nh4.More references\r\n\r\n* \"Wikipedia article for Verbs\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb\r\n* \"Wikipedia article for Gerunds\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund\r\n* \"Oxford Dictionaries Online: Adding -ed and -ing\":http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/verb-tenses-adding-ed-and-ing","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":173246,"created_at":"2023-09-24T17:35:08.401-04:00","updated_at":"2025-02-06T21:50:48.881-05:00","title":"yoru_mac","body":"[[McDonald's]] Japan's post-5pm menu line-up, known as Yoru Mac (literally \"Night Mac\", with the alternate name of \"McDonald's in the Night\"), introduced in June 2017 first in Aichi, Gifu and Mie Prefecture, before being expanded nation-wide in March 2018.

It was the first console released in the 16-bit era, albeit still utilizing an 8-bit CPU. Originally intended to \"beat\" the Nintendo [[Famicom]] (which it achieved in Japan), it ended up competing against the likes of the [[Sega Mega Drive]], [[Super Famicom]], and even the [[Neo Geo]] AES.\r\n\r\nThe TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit GPU; and is capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of 14 cm×14 cm×3.8 cm (5.5 in×5.5 in×1.5 in), [b]the NEC PC Engine holds the record for the world's smallest game console ever made[/b].\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, Telegames released a slightly altered version of the American model simply as the TurboGrafx around 1990 in extremely limited quantities. Although there was no full-scale PAL region release of the system, imported PC Engine consoles were largely available in France and Benelux through major retailers thanks to the unlicensed importer Sodipeng (Société de Distribution de la PC Engine, a subsidiary of Guillemot International).\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the PC Engine was very successful. It gained strong third-party support and outsold the Famicom at its 1987 debut, eventually becoming the Super Famicom's main rival. However, the TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and sold poorly, which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing. \r\n\r\nAt least 17 distinct models of the console were made, including portable versions and those that integrated the CD-ROM add-on. An enhanced model, the PC Engine SuperGrafx, was rushed to market in 1989. It featured many performance enhancements and was intended to supersede the standard PC Engine. It failed to catch on—only six titles were released that took advantage of the added power and it was quickly discontinued. The final model was discontinued in 1994. \r\n\r\nTwo major revisions, the [[PC Engine SuperGrafx]] and the PC Engine Duo, were released in 1989 and 1991, respectively. The entire series was succeed by the unsuccessful PC-FX in 1994, which was only released in Japan after the TurboGrafx-16 and its revised variants failed to gain enough market share in North America.\r\n\r\nNote that this tag is for a game console.

The RAF was also supported by several squadrons of Polish pilots who escaped to Britain after the conquest of [[Poland]] by Nazi Germany. The British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as [b]the Blitz[/b], that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.\r\n\r\nThe battle ended with a British victory after they regained air superiority over the island. The failure of the Luftwaffe to subdue the UK along with the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union resulted into a cancellation of the planned invasion of Britain, allowing the UK and western allies to refocus their war effort to the North Africa campaign.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["バトル・オブ・ブリテン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":224961,"created_at":"2025-02-06T13:11:44.841-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-06T13:11:44.841-05:00","title":"lotus26","body":"[[AI-generated|AI]] prompter.

First based in Mariupol and initially formed as a volunteer militia during the [[Russo-Ukrainian war]], it has participated in eight engagements. The unit was founded in May 2014 as a volunteer paramilitary militia under the command of \"Andriy Biletsky\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Biletsky] to fight pro-Russian forces in the Donbas War, and was formally incorporated into the National Guard on 11 November 2014.\r\n\r\nThe group has drawn controversy over its early and allegedly continuing association with far-right groups and neo-[[Nazi]] ideology, its early use of controversial symbols linked to Nazism (the [[black sun (symbol)|]], the [[Wolfsangel]] and the [[swastika]]), and allegations that members of the group have participated in torture and war crimes.  However, some experts argue that the regiment has evolved beyond its origins as street militia, tempering its neo-Nazi underpinnings as it became part of the Ukranian National Guard. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, criticism of the Azov Regiment has been a recurring theme of Russian politics and more recently as [[Vladimir Putin]]'s justification for invading Ukraine, the prominence of the unit in Ukraine's military forces being expanded and exaggerated by Russian media to this day.\r\n\r\nThe most recent official Azov Regiment logo now only uses a heavily altered Wolfsangel symbol, while the SSO (special forces) units don't use it at all (they use a [[tryzub]] formed out of swords instead).\r\n\r\nh4.
