Plot summary\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, people build their homes and raise domestic animals in subterranean caverns. As a result, they live in fear of the occasional earthquake and cave-in, and have been for hundreds of years. Jeeha is one such village.\r\n\r\nOne day, a boy named [[Simon (ttgl)|]] happens to find a small, shiny drill while digging to expand the village. At the same time, [[Kamina (ttgl)|]], a guy who believes that there is another land above the village, persuades a gangster to break through the ceiling in order to leave the cavern. Suddenly, an earthquake occurs and the ceiling collapses, followed by a big [[robot]] breaking through the ceiling.\r\n\r\nKamina is now sure that there is a world above them. Recklessly, he begins to fight against the robot. At that moment, another person appears from the land above. It is a girl by the name of [[Yoko Littner|Yoko]]. With a [[rifle]] in hand, she had been tracking the robot. However, all she could do was distract it. Then, Simon shows what he had found to Kamina and Yoko. It's a mysterious robot whose head is also its body.\r\n\r\nh4.

At school she wears the standard [[Homurabara Academy School Uniform]], while her casual clothes are a [[pink shirt]] and a [[yellow skirt|yellow]] [[long skirt]].\r\n\r\nIn [[Fate/Zero]], Sakura is [[Tohsaka Rin]]'s sister and the younger daughter of [[Tohsaka Tokiomi|Tokiomi]] and [[Tohsaka Aoi|Aoi]]. She was given away to the Matou family because the laws of the mage world prevented Tokiomi from training more than one of his daughters to carry on his family's tradition, and Tokiomi didn't want Sakura's potential to go to waste. However, [[Matou Zouken|Zouken]] is not really training her as a mage but instead putting her through hell. [[Matou Kariya]] made a deal with Zouken to win the Holy Grail in exchange for Sakura's freedom to return to the Tohsaka family, which he fails to do at the end of the series.\r\n\r\nIn [[Fate/Stay Night]], Sakura is [[Emiya Shirou|Shirou]]'s timid underclassman and [[Matou Shinji|Shinji]]'s adopted sister. She has been friends with Shirou since the previous summer when he was injured in an accident and she began visiting him with the excuse of taking care of him while he couldn't care for himself. Despite coming from the Matou family, Shinji claims she has been kept in the dark regarding magic as in a traditional magus household only the successor will be taught any magecraft (even though it's later revealed it's a lie and she's [[Medusa (rider) (fate)|Medusa Rider]]'s true master). Though she is respectful of her brother and defends his misconduct, he is in turn an abusive jerk towards her. Further, despite her upbeat attitude with Shirou, she is actually nearly silent and much gloomier when away from the Emiya household or Taiga and has no real friends apart from those two.\r\n\r\nIn [[Heaven's Feel]], Sakura becomes the love interest of the story and secrets about her life and the Matou family are slowly revealed.\r\n\r\nIn [[Fate/Extra CCC]], she is [[matou sakura (fate/extra)|reimagined as a new character]]. She created the AI named [[BB (Fate)]], who took her likeness and were assigned to monitor the moon. BB in turn created five Alter Ego servants collectively known as \"Sakura Five\", which were also modelled after Sakura.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent installments since [[Fate/Grand Order]], a number of servants (primarily those from the [[Hindu mythology]]) were manifested using Sakura's body as a vessel, therefore sharing her appearance. These servants along with BB and the Sakura Five were later collectively known as \"Sakurafaces\" by fanbase.\r\n\r\nh4.Variants\r\n\r\n* [[BB (Fate)|]]\r\n** [[BB (Swimsuit Mooncancer) (Fate)|]]\r\n* [[Dark Sakura]]\r\n* [[G-Sakura (capsule servant)|]]\r\n* [[Kama (fate)|]]\r\n* [[Kasuga no Tsubone (fate)|]]\r\n* [[Kazuradrop (fate)|]]\r\n* [[Kingprotea (fate)|]]\r\n* [[Matou Sakura (Fate/Extra)]]\r\n* [[Matou Sakura (Prisma Illya)]]\r\n* [[Meltryllis (fate)|]]\r\n** [[Meltryllis (Swimsuit Lancer) (Fate)|]]\r\n* [[Parvati (fate)|]]\r\n** [[Durga (Fate)|]]\r\n** [[Kali (Fate)|]]\r\n* [[Passionlip (fate)|]]\r\n* [[Violet (fate)|]]\r\n* [[Younger Edelfelt Sister (fate)|]]\r\n\r\nh4.Costumes\r\n\r\n* [[matou sakura (cute orangette)|Cute Orangette]]\r\n* [[Matou Sakura (Deen S&M)|Deen S&M]]\r\n* [[matou sakura (imaginary around)|Imaginary Around]]\r\n* [[matou sakura (kitchen patissiere)|Kitchen Patissiere]]\r\n* [[matou sakura (street choco-maid)|Street Choco-Maid]]\r\n\r\nh4.Unnamed Official Costumes\r\n\r\n* post #9618\r\n* post #13696\r\n* post #101817\r\n* post #299297\r\n* post #1368453\r\n* post #1936197\r\n* post #1969172\r\n* post #2095995\r\n* post #2168825\r\n* post #2168831\r\n* post #2314136\r\n* post #3398905\r\n* post #4389464\r\n\r\nh4.

The game contains normal weapons like the Bazooka, Shotgun and the Uzi, but also unusual and bizarre weapons like the Concrete Donkey, Super Sheep, Banana Bomb, etc. Utilities can also be found in game, such as the Ninja Rope, a flexible rope with more options than expected for moving Worms, the Jet Pack, and the Teleport. The players will just get a specific amount of weapons, while other weapons, utilities and additional health can be found in Crates which drop from the sky.\r\n\r\nThe game series also contains less common Schemes like Rope Racing, where the players should get from the start to the finish as fast as possible while only using the Ninja Rope. Players will use the Worm-like acrobats or Tarzan, who swings from rope-to-rope.\r\n\r\nThe series also has a few characters, such as Boggy B, Spadge, and Clagnut. There are also villains like Professor Worminkle and Boggy the Kid.

Originally a boy from a Romani family, he witnessed his mother's death at the hands of some demons she had summoned to fight Latverian soldiers. Swearing revenge, he began to master magic and technology. Eventually, he traveled to America to study some more, and that is where he met (and eventually became foes with) [[Reed Richards]].\r\n\r\nDue to an incident involving constructing a portal to Hell to resurrect his mother, Doom blamed Richards for the incident for causing the scars on his face. He constructed a suit of metal armor and became the cloaked tyrant scientist known today. He considers himself to be the smartest man on Earth and shows signs of politeness to his enemies. He's known for talking about himself in the third person and for having several \"Doombots\" that can pose as him.\r\n\r\nAside the Fantastic Four, Doom has faced nearly every superhero in the Marvel Universe: [[Avengers (series)|The Avengers]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[X-Men]], to name a few.\r\n\r\nDoom appears in various Marvel-related media, such as movies, TV shows, and video games. Among one of his most famous appearances is in the [[Marvel vs. Capcom]] series of fighting games, where he is a playable character. In Japan, his [[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|1967 animated version]], known as Akuma Hakase, or Dr. Demon, is fondly remembered by older fans for being a more comedic spin on the character, speaking in [[Nagoyaben]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Dr.ドゥーム","ドクター・ドゥーム","ドクタードゥーム","ヴィクター・フォン・ドゥーム","Dr.Doom","DoctorDoom","悪魔博士"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":237774,"created_at":"2025-04-14T01:19:12.268-04:00","updated_at":"2025-04-14T01:19:12.268-04:00","title":"dental_floss","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["デンタルフロス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":176808,"created_at":"2023-11-10T11:43:22.642-05:00","updated_at":"2025-04-14T01:16:49.729-04:00","title":"janggi","body":"Janggi, sometimes called Korean chess, is a strategy board game popular on the Korean Peninsula.

It sports very long shoes, short limbs, a disproportionately long and pointy nose, and quills that appear uneven or almost pyramid-like. Its eyes are notably elongated and squished, giving Metal Sonic an expression that many describe as unamused or oddly quirky.\r\n\r\nDespite—or because of—its unusual appearance, the Bootleg Metal Sonic Plush has become a cult favorite within the Sonic the Hedgehog community.

Starring in several cartoons and anime, movies, a hit video game series, and holds the record for the longest running comic book series based from a [[video game]] franchise. \r\n\r\nThe main hero of the [[Sonic (series)|]] franchise, [b]Sonic the Hedgehog[/b] is a blue-colored hedgehog who can run at extremely fast speeds, and has a upbeat personality with a smarty-pants attitude while always looking forward to adventures. He loves chili dogs and rock music. He makes friends easily, but will equally not forgive anyone who threatens his friends and the world. His long-time nemesis is [[Dr. Eggman]], but they seem to uphold their rivalry on decent terms. Sonic can also change his form state, by collecting all 7 of the [[Chaos Emerald]]s and harnessing their positive energy to transform into Super Sonic; which bears a striking resemblance to a [[Super Saiyan]] from the [[Dragon Ball Z]] universe. This in turn grants him exponential speed and power increases, among flight abilities also making him immune to most attacks. \r\n\r\nSonic was designed and created by Japanese artist and game designer \"Oshima Naoto\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_%C5%8Cshima. He was initially codenamed \"Mr. Needlemouse\" during development as Sega's new mascot and was originally colored teal. His trademark blue pigmentation was chosen later to match Sega's cobalt blue logo. \"Uekawa Yuji\":http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Yuji_Uekawa provided the revamping of Sonic The Hedgehog's art style with the shift to the 3D era with the [[Sonic Adventure]] games around 1998.\r\n\r\nSonic replaced [[Alex Kidd (character)|Alex Kidd]] as the official mascot of [[SEGA]] Corporation since 1991.\r\n\r\nVoiced by Kanemaru Jun'ichi in Japan, and Jaleel White, Martin Burke, Ryan Drummond, Jason Griffith, and Roger Craig Smith in North America.\r\n\r\nh4.

More than 80,000 T-34s and its variants were produced by the Soviet Union during WWII, making it the most produced tank of the whole war. Because of this some experts have even declared that the T-34 is \"the tank that saved the Soviet Union\".\r\n\r\nAt its introduction, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, speed, protection, and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its heavy sloped armor was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. Its engine was small and efficient, also providing very high speed and a long autonomy and range. However, this come at the cost of atrocious crew ergonomics as the crew of four (later five in the late [[T-34-85]] variant) were tightly packed in frontal compartment.\r\n\r\nh4.

Tall, fast, versatile, moderately armored, with a sloped glacis and a rounded turret housing a 75mm or 76mm gun, the reliable M4 saw worldwide use in both the Pacific (where it excelled) and the European theaters of the war.\r\n\r\nWhile the tank proved to be quite superior against the light armor used by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in the Pacific, the much heavier and potent tanks of the German [[Wehrmacht]] became very dangerous foes for the Sherman, which was even nicknamed \"The Tin Coffin\" or \"The Coffin on Tracks\" by American crews operating it in the European theater. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, its superior numbers and the fact that it was very easy to produce (in vast numbers), maintain, repair and modify (European crews eventually added extra armor and more potent anti-tank armament) proved crucial for the American war effort and made the Sherman tank a very successful combat machine design in the end.\r\n\r\nMore extensive modifications undertaken during the [[Cold War]] - specifically, the fitment of the [[AMX-13]]'s turret and gun on the M4 chassis by Egypt, and the addition of more powerful engines and a tweaked 105mm F1 gun taken from the [[AMX-30]] by Israel (the later receiving the designation of M-51 or Super Sherman) gave the old design a new lease of life decades after its retirement, proving the tank's capabilities could be expanded much further beyond its original specifications.\r\n\r\nh4.
