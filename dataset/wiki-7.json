In his racing prime, he was a dapple gray with a wide blaze marking with a distinctive forking snip, a stocking on his right back leg and a coronet on his left back leg. With age, he now has an almost fully white coat, with only the markings being whiter. He commonly ran with a black hood emblazoned with his name, usually without the ear covers, wearing blinkers and a shadow roll.\r\n\r\nGold Ship became infamous for its unpredictable temperament and [[12 billion yen incident|wildly inconsistent performances]], as well as being popular after retirement for being somewhat of a goof. Nevertheless, it had a greatly successful career, with over ¥1b in total earnings.\r\n\r\nAs a stallion, he had tremendous success in actually breeding and conceiving children, and as a sire, he at least had several graded winners, their main weakness being how many of them inherited his temperament and moodiness.\r\n\r\nh4.

Sired by [[Orfevre (racehorse)|]] and foaled by [[Mowen (racehorse)|]]. She is a bay mare with a wide blaze marking that is slanted over the left side of her face, socks on all but her front left leg and is notable for being unusually small as well as being [[Titleholder (racehorse)|]]'s elder sister.\r\n\r\nThis diminutive thoroughbred is famous for having the record as the JRA's lightest winner of a race - at 338 kg - and usually hovers around 350 kg. Most of her fellow competitors as well as both parents (in their racing years, both were around 450 and 460 kg) are at least a full 100 kg heavier than her. While not a top-level runner, she actually has modest success as a Stayer (a long-distance runner) and is renowned for her exceptional stamina. Her first win was at a 2400 m race, her other wins being above that distance and her only Classics appearance being a respectable 5th place at the Kikuka Sho (3000 m. Two years later, Titleholder would win that race). After a long career running in many of Japan's longest races, Melody Lane retired on December 2024 at age 8 due to a bowed tendon. She returned to Okada Stud to assume broodmare duties.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, being an idol horse, she is a popular choice for [[horse girl|original]] [[Umamusume]], often depicted together with her RL sire Orfevre (either in her [[orfevre (old design) (umamusume)|old design]] or in her [[orfevre_(umamusume)|canon version]]) or a umamusume version of Titleholder. She is usually represented this way with brown hair with a wide blaze marking making the left side of her bangs, an ornament based on her namesake flower or a musical note ([i]Melody[/i] Lane) on or around [b]her left ear[/b], and is typically portrayed as much smaller than most other characters. With the eventual presence of her contemporaries in the game, she was finally hinted at as \"A particularly small Umamusume\" in [[Chrono Genesis (umamusume)|]]' scenario.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["メロディーレーン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":258288,"created_at":"2025-09-10T00:05:16.600-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-10T00:05:16.600-04:00","title":"miyama_poppy_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Kaburaya O (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Pharamond (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Green Chateau (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Chateaugay (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ミヤマポピー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":258287,"created_at":"2025-09-10T00:04:15.857-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-10T00:04:15.857-04:00","title":"meiner_kitz_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Chief Bearhart (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Chief's Crown (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Takara Kanna (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Soccer Boy (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["マイネルキッツ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":258286,"created_at":"2025-09-10T00:02:50.179-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-10T00:02:50.179-04:00","title":"hagino_real_king_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Real Shadai (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Roberto (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Sound (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Danzig (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ハギノリアルキング"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":129871,"created_at":"2021-10-31T23:41:59.422-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-10T00:01:53.744-04:00","title":"mejiro_mcqueen_(racehorse)","body":"[table]\r\n[body]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Sire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Mejiro Titan (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Grandsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Mejiro Asama (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Dam:[/td]\r\n[td][[Mejiro Aurora (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td]Damsire:[/td]\r\n[td][[Remand (racehorse)|]][/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/body]\r\n[/table]\r\n\r\nReal-life racehorse.

His outfit mostly sports a [[fire]] design. He has [[blue eyes]], and [[long hair|long]], [[blonde hair]] that is occasionally tied in a [[ponytail]] but is normally [[hair down|worn down]].

Compared to laid-back Terry and jokester Joe, Andy is the serious straight man of the trio, honing his skill to a razor's edge with a killer instinct that lets him defeat foes that even give Terry and Joe a hard time. His singular blind spot is his brother Terry, whom he treats as a rival; he gets too excited fighting him and tends to lose against him.\r\n\r\nMai is Andy's lover and, at least as of FF:CotW, is engaged to her. Historically, Mai tended to move the relationship a bit too quickly for Andy's liking, a point played for humor.\r\n\r\nAs of [[Garou: Mark of the Wolves]], he and Mai are training a young Shiranui-ryuu disciple, [[Hokutomaru]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アンディ・ボガード"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":36789,"created_at":"2012-08-16T18:33:56.108-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-09T18:35:42.277-04:00","title":"terry_bogard","body":"Main character of the [[Fatal Fury]] series and a regular in [[The King of Fighters]].

For example, he is commonly cited as the primary inspiration for [[Guilty Gear]]'s [[Sol Badguy]].

The project was helmed by CEO [[Tazumi Riku]] and then-COO Iwanaga Taiki, the latter having since departed from the company.\r\n\r\nWhile the app has no release date, and early on wasn't even approved by Apple, it is actively used by [i]Nijisanji Project[/i], a group of official [[virtual YouTuber|VTuber]]s referred to as \"Virtual Livers\".\r\n\r\nTheir characters are notably in 2D, instead of the initially more popular and established trend of 3D. This strategy was to minimize upfront investment and allow themselves a broader range of personalities.

Identification\r\n\r\nBelow are some common signs that something may be AI-generated. If you are unsure whether a post is AI-generated or not, ask in topic #22285.\r\n\r\nh6. Generic art style\r\n\r\nMany models have a distinctive \"samey\" art style. You can browse {{ai-generated status:deleted}} to get a feel for this.\r\n\r\nNote that having a generic-looking art style isn't necessarily evidence of AI. Some artists may naturally draw this way, or have had their style copied by AI.\r\n\r\nh6. AI resolutions\r\n\r\nCertain image resolutions are commonly used by AI models, and less often used by humans. These include:\r\n\r\n* {{width:832 height:1216|832×1216}}, {{width:1024 height:1024|1024×1024}}, {{width:1216 height:832|1216×832}} (used by Stable Diffusion XL and NovelAI's Opus-tier).\r\n* {{width:512 height:768|512×768}}, {{width:768 height:1152|768×1152}}, {{width:768 height:512|768×512}}, {{width:1152 height:768|1152×768}}, {{width:768 height:1152|768x1152}}, {{width:1248 height:1824|1248×1824}}, {{width:1824 height:1248|1824×1248}}, {{width:1536 height:1536|1536×1536}}.\r\n\r\nIn general, AI models cannot generate at a resolution where both height and width are not divisible by 8, although humans can upscale, crop, or edit the final output to make it any resolution.\r\n\r\nh6. EXIF metadata\r\n\r\nIf the file contains metadata such as AI prompts or model names, it's a sure sign it's AI. On the upload page, you can click the filesize beneath the image to see the EXIF metadata. Danbooru will automatically show a warning and tag [[AI-generated]] after upload if the metadata indicates it is AI-generated.\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible for an artist to draw on top of an AI-generated base or use an [[AI-generated background]], in which case the work may be considered [[AI-assisted]] instead of fully [[AI-generated]].\r\n\r\nh6. Inhuman mistakes\r\n\r\nAI models often make abnormal or unusual mistakes within the artwork, such as:\r\n\r\n* [[Anatomical nonsense]], such as extra legs (post #5732513), fused fingers (post #5742855), fused legs (post #5735212), etc.\r\n* Strangely drawn objects/environments such as a book with it's cover as another layer of pages (post #5738243), wooden floor conforming with the shape of a character's hair (post #5850417), poor line continuity/object permanence when an object is hidden or goes behind other objects (post #5779922), etc.\r\n\r\nNote that [[bad hands]] or other [[artistic error]]s are not in themselves signs of AI-generation, as humans can make mistakes too. The errors made by AI tend to be completely illogical or physically impossible things that no human would draw.\r\n\r\nh6. Large volumes of art\r\n\r\nA brand new artist pumping out improbably large volumes of high quality-looking art in a short period of time, faster than any human could produce, is a strong indicator of AI. This isn't automatically a sign of AI-generation though, as sometimes new artists may release a pre-prepared portfolio of artwork to establish their presence on a new platform.\r\n\r\nh6. Unnatural art style changes\r\n\r\nAn artist with an unnatural change in art style after early-October 2022 (when NovelAI released their first image generation model) may be a sign they switched to using AI. This can easily be seen with artists with a low quality art style suddenly shifting into the generic-looking art style typical of NovelAI.\r\n\r\nSome other notable dates for this would be:\r\n\r\n* 2023/11/15 - NovelAI V3 release\r\n* 2024/10/18 - NoobAI-XL release\r\n* 2025/02/28 - NovelAI V4 release\r\n* 2025/03/26 - GPT4o native image generation release\r\n* 2025/05/29 - NovelAI V4.5 release\r\n\r\nBear in mind that humans can naturally change their style or improve over time too. This would be for unnatural changes in style.\r\n\r\nh6. Garbled text\r\n\r\nOlder models have trouble generating realistic text, often producing gibberish or nonsense instead. Newer models may be better at generating text.\r\n\r\nA lack of any signatures, web addresses, or watermarks can also be a clue, as human artists often sign their work, while fully AI-generated works often lack signatures.\r\n\r\nh6. AI mentions\r\n\r\nMentions of using \"AI\", software such as \"ComfyUI\", or common models such as \"Nijijourney,\" \"Midjourney,\" \"NovelAI,\" or \"Stable Diffusion\" in the tags, description, or the artist's bio are a very likely sign of AI. Be careful not to confuse prohibitions against AI training with admissions of AI use.\r\n\r\nh4.

Usually translated as \"demon\" or \"[[ogre]]\".\r\n\r\nTraditionally depicted with [[red skin|red]] or [[blue skin]], a [[tiger print]] [[loincloth]], and [[horns]]. Oni horns can be depicted in various ways, whether it be as long, smooth, [[skin-covered horns|skin-covered]] or otherwise the same color as the skin, located on the forehead; or [[cone horns|cone-shaped]] in any number of colors, whether it be white, grey, yellow, etc. atop their head. Their weapon of choice is the [[spiked club]], particularly the [[kanabou]]. They are violent and favor brawn over brains.\r\n\r\nSave for the horns, modern depictions tend to mute these characteristics considerably or entirely, especially in female characters, only keeping their iconic dual horns intact.\r\n\r\nOni are commonly associated with [[Setsubun]], a holiday taking place on February 3rd, the last day of winter in the traditional Japanese calendar. On this day it is tradition to throw roasted soybeans in order to drive away oni; this practice is known as [[mamemaki]].\r\n\r\nTypical examples of oni are [[Lum]], [[Gedomaru]], [[Ibuki Suika]] and [[Hoshiguma Yuugi]].\r\n\r\nh4.

It is a slice of life comedy series focusing on otaku life and its consequences.\r\n\r\nThe title is a shortening of the club's official name, [b]GEN[/b]dai [b]SHI[/b]kaku Bunka [b]KEN[/b]kyūkai (現代視覚文化研究会), which is translated as [i][b]The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture[/b][/i]. It is based on a club that existed at Kio's alma mater during his university days, but the Genshiken is located at [[Shiou University]], which is based on the Tama Campus of Chuo University (中央大学) in Hachiouji, Tokyo.\r\n\r\nSerialized in Kodansha's [i]Afternoon[/i] from 2002-2006, the manga series continued for a second season as Genshiken II ([i]Genshiken Nidaime[/i] or [i]Genshiken Second Generation[/i]), which was released in December 2010 and ended in August 2016.\r\n\r\nThe original manga was also adapted into two separate TV anime series by Genco in 2004 and 2007, as well as a 3 episode OVA in 2006. Additionally, Kio Shimoku announced in the manga that a new TV anime adaptation of the [i]Second Generation[/i] manga was in the works with the title [i]Genshiken Nidaime[/i] (げんしけん 二代目 - [i]Genshiken Second Generation[/i]), later airing in Japan from July 6 to September 29, 2013.\r\n\r\nA [i]Genshiken Second Season OAD[/i] or Original Animation DVD was bundled with the limited edition of the 15th volume of the Genshiken manga. It was released in Dec 20, 2013 with the title [i]Genshiken Nidaime No Roku DVD[/i] (げんしけん オリジナルアニメDVD). The story is set between the events of Genshiken 2 and the Genshiken Nidaime series so none of the new characters from Nidaime appear in this anime.\r\n\r\nA spin-off, [[Kujibiki Unbalance]], was produced by Ajia-do Animation Works in 2006, along with a manga, illustrated by [[Koume Keito]].\r\n\r\n[[Spotted Flower]], a manga periodically illustrated and produced by Kio outside of Afternoon since 2009, is loosely based on Genshiken.\r\n\r\nh4.
