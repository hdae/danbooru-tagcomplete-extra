When [[Sun Ce]] was assassinated, Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the Yangtze River from his brother. \r\n\r\nIn winter of 207, the northern warlord [[Cao Cao]] led an army of approximately 220,000 to conquer the south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by [[Zhang Zhao]], urged surrender whilst the other, led by [[Zhou Yu]] and [[Lu Su]] and with support from a diplomatic mission by [[Zhuge Liang]], opposed Cao Cao. Eventually Sun Quan decided to ally with Liu Bei and employing the combined strategies of Zhou Yu and [[Huang Gai]], they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn late 220, [[Cao Pi]], King of Wei, Cao Cao's son and successor, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the Emperor of China, ending and succeeding the nominal rule of the Han dynasty. At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Wei vassal with the Wei-created title of King of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son [[Sun Deng]] as a hostage to the Wei capital Luoyang and he refused and declared himself independent by changing his era name. It was not until May 229 that he formally declared himself emperor.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his original crown prince, Sun Deng, two opposing factions supporting different potential successors slowly emerged. Sun Quan harshly settled the conflict between the two factions by exiling [[Sun He]] and forcing [[Sun Ba]] to commit suicide. Sun Quan died in May 252 at the age of 70 (by East Asian reckoning). He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms and was succeeded by his son, [[Sun Liang]]. \r\n\r\nh4.

On May 25, 2020, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street, calling out \"I can't breathe,\" during an arrest made with three other officers. Chauvin was dismissed by the Minneapolis Police Department on May 26 and arrested on May 29. The murder set off a series of protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, across the United States and around the world.\r\n\r\nChauvin was a member of the Minneapolis Police Department from 2001 to 2020. In his career, Chauvin had 18 complaints against him in his official record and was involved in three police shootings, one of which was fatal. He received two letters of reprimand for misconduct. He received two medals of valor and two commendation medals during his career.\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, Chauvin was put on trial for unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter of Floyd before a jury in the Minnesota Fourth Judicial District Court. On April 20, he was convicted on all of the charges. On June 25, he was sentenced to 22½ years in prison (with credit given for 199 days time served), with the possibility of supervised release after 15 years (two thirds of his sentence) contingent on factors such as good behavior. Requests to the Minnesota Supreme Court and Supreme Court of the United States for review were denied.\r\n\r\nChauvin pleaded guilty in late 2021 to federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights by using unreasonable force and ignoring Floyd's serious medical needs. Simultaneously, Chauvin pleaded guilty to violating a 14-year-old boy's civil rights in 2017 by using unreasonable force. In mid-2022, Chauvin was sentenced to 21 years in prison for violating Floyd's civil rights. The federal and state sentences are to run concurrently. The Minnesota Department of Corrections lists Chauvin's anticipated release date on the state sentence as December 10, 2035. For the federal charges, Chauvin will likely be released from prison in the year 2038. Chauvin filed a motion in federal court in mid-November 2023 attempting to vacate his guilty plea.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the criminal and civil rights cases, Chauvin was transferred in August 2022 from Oak Park Heights prison in Minnesota to FCI Tucson in Arizona, a medium-security federal facility, to serve his sentence. He was stabbed by another inmate at the federal facility on November 24, 2023.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":144910,"created_at":"2022-06-07T17:07:43.139-04:00","updated_at":"2025-01-24T18:24:47.865-05:00","title":"george_floyd","body":"George Floyd was an African-American man who was killed by police officer [[Derek Chauvin]] in May [[2020]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":118971,"created_at":"2020-12-10T15:34:36.077-05:00","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:46:36.926-05:00","title":"weibo","body":"Sina Weibo is a Chinese microblogging website, which also includes an alternative social networking service.\r\n\r\nh4.

The Yamato-class displaced 72000 tonnes, carried 46 cm (18.1 inch) guns and boasted a great amount of armor, with the waterline belt alone reaching 41 cm in thickness. They were the largest battleships commissioned by any navy during WWII.\r\n\r\nDesigned between 1934 and 1936, her keel was laid down on 4 November 1937 and she was launched on 8 August 1940. Yamato wasn't commissioned until 16 December 1941, just over a week after the Pearl Harbor attack. Secrecy was maintained throughout her construction with canopies erected at the slipway to hide her from view. Her commissioning was only a simple ceremony and even after completion multiple other warships were docked in a strategic manner to hide her from being seen.\r\n\r\nYamato was also known for her high level of luxury for an IJN battleship, as she was designed as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. She sported ice cream machines, ramune machines, large baths and lockers for all crew. The crewmen slept in bunks rather than tatami like most IJN warships. Yamato was also fully air-conditioned. These luxurious fitting, as well as her rather unimpressive battle record for a ship of her size ended up giving her the nickname \"Yamato Hotel\".\r\n\r\nAlongside her famed 46 cm guns, Yamato was initially equipped with 15.5 cm guns in four triple turrets. By 1945 she had the two 15.5 cm beam turrets removed in favor of more anti-air guns to combat the ever increasing threat of aerial attacks. She only fired her massive main guns once during the Battle off Samar. Yamato never got to fight any other battleship as she was designed for, as carriers and naval aviation became more prevalent. This was perfectly demonstrated when she sank in [[Operation Ten-gou]], after being attacked by over 400 US Navy airplanes.\r\n\r\nToday, Yamato appears in numerous media, including anime like [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]] and [[Strike Witches]] and personified as a human in [[Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio]] and [[Kantai Collection]].\r\n\r\nh4.
