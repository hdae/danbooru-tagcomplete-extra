Although he had been noted for his bravery, he was still deemed as nothing more than a \"mere warrior\" for his lack of literacy skills.

In 217, he succeeded Lu Su as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province. Two years later, in a carefully calculated military operation, Lü Meng led an invasion of [[Liu Bei|Liu Bei's]] territories in southern Jing Province, swiftly and stealthily capturing all the lands from Liu Bei's general [[Guan Yu]], who was captured and executed after his defeat.

When the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]] seized control of the capital Luoyang, Xun Yu feared for his safety and resigned, returning to Ji Province. In the subsequent years, warlords quickly rose in each region; Xun Yu first served [[Yuan Shao]], whose power base was in Ji Province, but later left him and went to serve Cao Cao in 191. Cao Cao recognised Xun Yu's talent and he exclaimed, \"Here comes my [[Zifang]]!\" when Xun Yu arrived, and he appointed Xun as an army commandant. \r\n\r\nIn 211, Xun Yu, whose ideals were for Cao Cao to continue being the protector of the Han dynasty, opposed a proposal by Dong Zhao for Cao Cao to set up his own self administrated feudal state within the Han Dynasty. Displeased, Cao Cao sent him an empty food box, a sign that he should commit suicide. Xun Yu died under suspicious circumstances of illness in Shouchun in 212.\r\n\r\nh4.
