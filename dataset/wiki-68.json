At the same time, [[Kamina (ttgl)|]], a guy who believes that there is another land above the village, persuades a gangster to break through the ceiling in order to leave the cavern. Suddenly, an earthquake occurs and the ceiling collapses, followed by a big [[robot]] breaking through the ceiling.\r\n\r\nKamina is now sure that there is a world above them. Recklessly, he begins to fight against the robot. At that moment, another person appears from the land above. It is a girl by the name of [[Yoko Littner|Yoko]]. With a [[rifle]] in hand, she had been tracking the robot. However, all she could do was distract it. Then, Simon shows what he had found to Kamina and Yoko. It's a mysterious robot whose head is also its body.\r\n\r\nh4.

Some characters (often the more 'regal' or 'authoritative' ones) will speak in a faux \"antiquated stage Japanese\", analogous to using \"thees and thous\" and other 'Shakespearisms' in an English work.\r\n\r\nDrawn works set in a jidaigeki setting will often feature a [[sumi-e]] \"ink wash\" aesthetic or other elements of traditional Japanese art.\r\n\r\nFor tagging purposes, any post that depicts a visibly \"Medieval Japanese\" setting generally counts. Consider this the Japanese culture equivalent of the [[Medieval]] tag. Avoid tagging [[Touhou]] works with this tag, or other mixed fantastical/sci-fi settings, unless they have the distinct \"jidaigeki\" feel. \r\n\r\n(This may be hard to quantify, but generally, if it feels like a \"samurai period piece film\", then it counts, even if it's a mixed setting.)\r\n\r\nh4. Tag usage notes\r\n* Tag jidaigeki for posts that feature a visibly Japanese 'Medieval' theme.\r\n** Especially if it focuses on samurai and feudal lords/shoguns, analogous to knights and lords for Western [[Medieval]] works.\r\n* Avoid tagging jidaigeki for mixed settings unless one is  sure that it qualifies.\r\n* Avoid tagging jidaigeki for settings that have a central focus on fantastical or 'magical' elements, even if set in the appropriate era.\r\n** Generally these will focus on gods, magic, youkai and the like. \r\n** e.g. [[Ookami (game)|Ōkami]] (it is also set in prehistoric Japan instead of 'medieval' Japan.)\r\n** The analogy is like [[medieval]] vs. [[fantasy]]. There is some overlap, and some posts may qualify for both. Likewise, some overtly fantastical or 'magical' settings may also [i]feel[/i] jidaigeki if there is significant focus on samurai characters (or feudal lords, or \"the common people\").\r\n* [[Ninja]]s by themselves generally do not count for jidaigeki. \r\n\r\nh4.
