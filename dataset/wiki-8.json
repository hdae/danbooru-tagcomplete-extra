May also apply to male-to-[[futanari]] but not to female-to-futanari. A being with no sex depicted as any of these may technically count.\r\n\r\nThis tag can also be applied to a [[trap]] if the character is given female traits such as the presence of actual [[cleavage]] or the obvious absence of a [[bulge]] at the crotch. For [[reverse trap]]s, the absence of cleavage or presence of a bulge applies.\r\n\r\nIf a character is genderswapped often enough, the genderswapped version may be given its own name. For male-to-female genderswaps, this is often the normal character's name with \"ko\" appended to it. (子 \"Ko\" meaning \"child\" is a common ending for Japanese girls' names.) For female-to-male genderswaps, \"o\" is sometimes added. \r\n\r\nKnown in Internet circles as Rule 63, wherein there is a female or male version of any given male or female character, respectively.\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b] \r\n* If the person has only swapped bodies with another from the opposite sex, but the body itself has not changed, then use [[personality switch]] instead.\r\n* The \"女体化\" tag may also on occasion be used to describe female [[personification]], rather than a genderswap.\r\n* If a character in canon is genderswapped but rarely shown in their original form (such as [[Mai Natsume]], [[Tanya Degurechaff]] or [[Oyama Mahiro]]), the tag only applies if said original form is included or somehow alluded to.\r\n* For posts depicting a character undergoing the process of gender transition, use the tag [[gender transitioning]].\r\n\r\nh4.

To defend their home from zombies, some which have unique abilities, the player uses plants that can fire projectiles at, give \"sun\" to purchase other plants to help or block the advancing zombies. Players must plan defenses in multiple \"lanes\" across the home's lawn and should a zombie make it to the house on any lane, the game is over. Director George Fan was inspired to make the game after playing other tower defense titles and desiring to eliminate the typical strategies of sending advancing enemies through mazes of defenses, instead adapting the lane approach to remove this strategy.\r\n\r\nThe game would inspire a franchise, one which would even have a ton of exclusive content made for it in China.\r\n\r\nh4.

The illusion features a simple pattern of light green and dark green squares, with primroses (magenta and white) in the corners of the squares.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed, the pattern appears to undulate or wave, creating a sense of motion. This illusion is an example of a peripheral drift illusion, where the brain interprets static visual information as dynamic motion. The Primrose Field Illusion is particularly striking due to its use of color, which enhances the perceived motion.\r\n\r\nThe illusion works by exploiting the way the brain processes visual information. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns and motion, and the Primrose Field Illusion takes advantage of this by presenting a subtle, gradient-like pattern that our brains interpret as movement. The use of color and the specific arrangement of the squares create a sense of depth and dimensionality, further reinforcing the illusion.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":257931,"created_at":"2025-09-07T00:08:21.764-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-07T00:08:21.764-04:00","title":"e.y.e:_divine_cybermancy","body":"E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy (stylized E.Ψ.Ǝ: Divine Cybermancy) is a first person shooter/roleplaying game created by French studio Streum On Studio.

The species name fuscatus is Latin for \"dark\".[7]\r\n\r\nThe sooty tern has little interspecific variation, but it is usually divided into six to eight allopatric subspecies. Some recent authors further subdivide the Indopacific population into up to eight subspecies altogether,[citation needed] but much of the variation is clinal. The affinities of eastern Pacific birds (including O. f. manutarus of Easter Island) are most strongly contested.[citation needed] Six subspecies are currently accepted by the IOC:[5] \r\n* !asset #32043416","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":11239,"created_at":"2009-04-20T12:51:52.500-04:00","updated_at":"2025-09-06T15:42:39.417-04:00","title":"ribbon","body":"A ribbon is a thin band of flexible material, typically cloth but also plastic or sometimes metal, used primarily for binding and tying.

Introduction\r\n\r\nIn here you will find the meaning behind most of the terms Danbooru users use. This also covers terms of other sites relevant to Danbooru.\r\n\r\nh4. Dictionary\r\n\r\nh5. User actions\r\n\r\n* [b]1up[/b] - When a better version of an existing post is uploaded, especially if the existing version hadn't been approved yet and ends up deleted because the new one was better. It was commonly seen with Pixiv posts 1upping Twitter posts back when Twitter reduced the quality of images.\r\n\r\n* [b]Gardening[/b] - Curating items by adding/removing/changing data, this term is usually applied to any edit action done in bulk, such as on:\r\n** \"artists\":/artists\r\n** \"artist commentaries\":/artist_commentaries\r\n** \"notes\":/notes\r\n** \"pools\":/notes\r\n** \"posts\":/posts - This includes edit actions on posts other than adding/removing tags.\r\n** \"tags\":/tags - Adding them to posts that should contain them, or removing them from posts that shouldn't.\r\n** \"wiki pages\":/wiki_pages\r\n\r\n* [b]Sniping[/b] - When someone uploads an artwork with few tags in an effort to be the first uploader. This is usually frowned upon.\r\n\r\n* [b]Mintagging[/b] - Tagging an upload with the bare minimum of tags or below; usually associated with sniping, but can also be a sign of laziness, which is also frowned upon.\r\n\r\n* [b]Nuke[/b] - Completely deleting a tag, usually done through a BUR.\r\n\r\nh5. Users\r\n\r\n* [b]Unres[/b] (short for unrestricted) - Users at the Contributor user level or above, able to upload while bypassing the [[about:mod queue|moderation queue]] entirely. The opposite of this is [b]Res[/b]tricted, meaning someone below Contributor level. ([[Help:Users]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Gold+[/b] - a short way of saying \"Gold level or higher\"\r\n\r\n* [b]Approver[/b] - Users who are able to approve (set as active, preventing them from being automatically deleted) posts, often nicknamed Janitors ([[Help:Users]]). \r\n\r\n* [b]Moderator[/b] - Users at the Moderator+ levels, who moderate the actions of users ([[Help:Users]]). Be aware that many of the people who approve/disapprove posts are Approvers but are not Moderators.\r\n\r\n* [b]Platinum-[/b] - A short way of saying \"Platinum level or lower\"\r\n\r\n* See [[help:users]] for a list of the different levels.\r\n\r\nh5. Posts\r\n\r\n* [b]Appeal[/b] - If you think a deleted post is undeserving of deletion, you can appeal it ([[Howto:appeal]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Blacklist[/b] - Danbooru hides posts if they contain a tag from your blacklist ([[Help:Blacklists]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Purged[/b] or [b]Expunged[/b] - Usually deleted posts are still on the server, so they can be undeleted if there was a mistake, or blocked from being reuploaded if not. Expunged posts are completely erased and gone for good, for example, post #6. This usually only happens in extreme circumstances—for example, illegal content.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] The primary reason this is not usually done is that it makes it possible to reupload the exact same image, which would now be unbanned/undeleted.[/tn]\r\n\r\n* [b]Flag[/b] or [b]Flagged[/b] - if a post is low quality or breaks the rules, you can flag it for deletion ([[Howto:Flag]])\r\n\r\n* [b]Hard Translated[/b] - When a translation is applied directly onto the image ([[hard-translated]]). Danbooru's notes system allows translators to put translations in boxes floating over the image without changing the file itself; this is called a [b]soft translation[/b].\r\n\r\n* [b]Normalized Source[/b] - When Danbooru uses the data provided from specific direct image links to give you normal sources that take you to the original post, eg. <https://i.pximg.net/img-original/img/2019/08/19/05/04/43/76340480_p0.png> brings to <https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/76340480>.\r\n** [tn][b]Note:[/b] This is only possible for sites where the original post is embedded in the image link somewhere.[/tn]\r\n\r\n* [b]Parent[/b] and [b]Child[/b] - A way to group together different versions of similar posts, or related posts ([[Help:Post relationships]])\r\n\r\nh5. Tags\r\n\r\n* [b]BUR[/b] - Stands for \"Bulk Update Request.\" By filling out \"this form\":[/bulk_update_requests/new], you can request one or more aliases, implications, or mass updates between tags.\r\n** [b]alias[/b] - When two tags mean the same thing, one can be set as an alias of the other, so that the aliased tag gets automatically changed to the destination tag on every post using it, and searching for the aliased tag searches for the destination instead ([[Help:Tag aliases]]).\r\n** [b]implication[/b] - When the presence of one tag will always mean a second tag should be added to the image, the first can be set to imply the second ([[Help:Tag implications]]).\r\n** [b]mass update[/b] - Changing one or more tags. For example, [[kancolle]] -> [[kantai collection]] would remove [[kancolle]] and replace it with [[kantai collection]] to all posts which contain the [[kancolle]] tag.\r\n** [b]rename[/b] - Renames a tag, moving all of its wiki and history data to the new name.\r\n** [b]category[/b] - Changes the category of a tag. Required on all tags with a post count greater than 1000, or those going to or from the [b]Meta[/b] category.\r\n\r\n* [b]Pet Tag[/b] - A tag created and maintained by a single user, which usually has narrow or confusing guidelines (for example arbitrarily omitting certain kind of artworks) and has low value to other users in its present state.\r\n\r\n* [b]Qualifier[/b] - A word in parentheses used as suffix for tags that have the same name, for example [[arrow_(projectile)]] and [[arrow_(symbol)]], or [[shimakaze (kancolle)|]] and [[shimakaze_(azur_lane)]]. Qualifiers are also used on artists that share name with other artists or tags, for example,  [[hammer]] and [[hammer_(sunset_beach)]]. See [[help:qualifiers]] for more information.\r\n\r\n* [b]Tag Script[/b] - Not an actual script! A special mode that users with Gold level or higher can use to add/remove tags from posts just by clicking on their thumbnails ([[Help:Tag scripts]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Umbrella Tag[/b] - A generic tag that several specific tags imply. For example, [[rose]], [[daisy (flower)|]], and [[sunflower]] each imply [[flower]].\r\n\r\n* [b]Utility Alias[/b] - An alias which doesn't move any post, made to improve searchability. For example, [[japanese sweets]] is aliased to [[wagashi]], because it's an uncommon word in English. This allows people to find the tag without having to google what Japanese sweets are called.\r\n\r\nh5. Other\r\n\r\n* [b]+1/-1[/b] - \"I agree\"/\"I disagree\"\r\n\r\n* [b]DMail[/b] - Private message (Direct Mail).\r\n\r\n* [b]DText[/b] - Text formatting system used for comments and forum posts ([[Help:DText]]).\r\n\r\n* [b]Feedback[/b] or [b]User Feedback[/b] ([[Help:User records]])\r\n\r\nh5. Danbooru site\r\n\r\n* [b]API[/b] or [b]API Key[/b] or [b]API Limits[/b] - If you use external programs with Danbooru (for example mass downloaders or userscripts), the API is how they communicate with the site. The API Key lets your program do things that require an account; using the key tells the site that it's coming from you. The API Limit is how quickly the program is allowed to do things on the site. This limit exists to reduce the risk of massive site vandalism. See [[Help:API]] for more information.\r\n\r\n* [b]Booru[/b] - Danbooru is the name of both this website and the site's behind-the-scenes software. There are other websites that use the same software, older/modified versions, or software with a similar idea. Altogether, these sites are called \"boorus.\"\r\n\r\n* [b]Safe mode[/b] - Danbooru's option to hide posts that are not rated general. Visit your account settings or use <https://donmai.moe>.\r\n\r\nh5. Other sites\r\n\r\n* [b]Rush Hour[/b] - Can refer to either the rush of artist uploads off-site or user uploads on-site, especially in the context of Pixiv for the former.\r\n** [b]Pixiv Rush[/b] - Every day, Pixiv rankings reset at \"00:00 JST\":[https://www.google.com/search?q=00%3A00+jst&oq=00%3A00+jst]. Artists upload to Pixiv just after reset, so all views and favorites in the day count towards Pixiv's daily popular page. It's become enough of a tradition there that even artists who aren't popular or skilled enough to hit the popular page will still join the rush.\r\n** [b]Danbooru Rush[/b] - Often times, as a Pixiv rush is happening, or after it has happened, a flood of uploaders on-site will rush to upload them as fast as possible; can also happen beyond Pixiv if a particularly popular artist uploads art elsewhere. Also see Sniping under User Actions.\r\n\r\n* [b]stacc[/b] - A page on Pixiv that shows the uploads (and optionally the favorites) of a Pixiv user (e.g. <https://www.pixiv.net/stacc/hmizuki>). The stacc name is also the login name of the user. Sometimes the stacc name can be used as a qualifier for the artist's tag, but it should be avoided.

The main stated reasons for this invasion were to eliminate Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, and promote democracy and stability in the region.\r\n\r\nThe Iraq War had its roots in the aftermath of the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. The U.S. government, under the administration of President [[George W. Bush]], argued that Iraq, under [[Saddam Hussein]], posed a threat due to its \"WMD programs\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#2003_Iraq_War and its potential to support terrorist organizations. However, the invasion and subsequent \"occupation of Iraq\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Iraq_(2003%E2%80%932011) faced significant \"controversy\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Iraq_War and \"opposition\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationale_for_the_Iraq_War, both domestically and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe conflict quickly led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, with his \"capture in 2003\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Saddam_Hussein and \"execution in 2006\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Saddam_Hussein, but the search for WMDs proved unsuccessful, and no substantial evidence of active WMD programs was found. The war also resulted in a \"protracted insurgency\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_insurgency_(2003%E2%80%932011), \"sectarian violence\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarian_violence_in_Iraq#Sectarian_violence_following_the_U.S._invasion, and the rise of extremist groups, including \"Al-Qaeda in Iraq\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_Iraq (later known as the \"Islamic State or ISIS\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State). After 8 years, 8 months and 25 days, the U.S. formally withdrew from Iraq on 15 December 2011, but has continued to maintain a small presence within the country, leading another \"coalition\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Joint_Task_Force_%E2%80%93_Operation_Inherent_Resolve to combat the ongoing \"ISIS insurgency\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_insurgency_in_Iraq_(2017%E2%80%93present).\r\n\r\nThe Iraq War had a \"profound and lasting impact on the region\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#Impacts. It destabilized Iraq, causing \"significant loss of life\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War and \"displacing millions of people\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crises_of_the_Iraq_War. The war also strained U.S. relations with some of its allies and led to widespread protests and opposition to the war. It remains a topic of debate and analysis with regard to its justifiability, consequences, and long-term effects on the Middle East and international politics.\r\n\r\nh4.

The common sunflower is most recognizable by their single large [[yellow flower|yellow]] apical \"flower,\" with an initially greenish center that turns yellow-brown and then blackish as it matures.  They typically grow to heights of around 3 meters (10 feet) with record plants reach heights of 9+ meters (30+ feet). Sunflowers are grown for various purposes such as for food, cooking oil, livestock feed, and decoration. \r\n\r\nDomestic sunflowers come in a variety of colors beyond the common yellow, with colors such as cream color, gold, orange, red, mahogany, and chocolate brown.  While the common types only feature a singular apical flower (one that grows at the tip of the central stem), there are also varieties that grow many additional branching flowers.  The large blooms of the sunflower while commonly called a \"flower\" is in fact a \"flower head,\" a structure composed of many smaller flowers (florets) that together appear as one single flower.\r\n\r\nSunflowers and their relatives are heliotropic while they're developing, meaning that the plants will turn following the direction of the sun during the day.  As they get closer to maturing, the plant stiffen and lose it's ability to track the sun. Due to their heliotropic nature, most plants will mature locked facing toward the East, the direction of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\n* !post #6797029\r\n\r\nh4.
