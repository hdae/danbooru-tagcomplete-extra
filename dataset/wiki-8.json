During his childhood, he met [[Kallen Kaslana]] and deemed her as his only friend, vowing together to save the world against the threat of the Honkai. When Kallen's father died for fighting the Honkai, Otto later discovered the 1st Divine Key, Void Archives into hopes of bringing back her late father, which he ended up reconsidering as her father's sacrifice will be in vain. This Divine Key would later assist him in his later goals.\r\n\r\nAfterwards in his adulthood, Otto became the next Overseer of Schicksal (specifically the 227th), securing the position for the next 500 years in his own callous obsession of finding ways to revive Kallen.

As such, she wears a variant of the \"basic\" uniform: a blue-and-white short-sleeved [[serafuku]] but with a brown collar (blue sailor collar) and a brown [[neckerchief]] characteristic of Shibafu's Ayanami-class. She completes the set with a blue [[pleated skirt]], [[black_socks|black]] [[kneehighs]], and a [[red ribbon]] on her braid.\r\n\r\nHer [[rigging]] consists of a funnel-mast backpack set, two 61 cm triple [[torpedo tubes]] on [[thigh strap]]s, and a 12.7 cm twin mount as a [[handgun]]. Her official art also has her swinging an [[anchor]] in her left hand.\r\n\r\nShe has a similar \"forthright energetic\" personality to [[Fubuki (Kancolle)|]], although with a somewhat more [[tomboy]]ish edge. She also has a strong respect for/dependency upon her sister-ship, [[Isonami (kancolle)|]], referring to her or asking for help from her whenever she is in trouble. She similarly has a strong attachment to her other historic division-mates, [[Ayanami (kancolle)|]] and [[Shikinami (kancolle)|]].\r\n\r\nThe real-life [i]Uranami[/i] was part of DesDiv 19 with sister-ships [i]Isonami[/i], [i]Ayanami[/i], and [i]Shikinami[/i]. During the [[Battle of Midway]], they were on escort duty, and [i]Uranami[/i] and [i]Isonami[/i] collided. She spent most of the war as an escort or a transport destroyer, and was eventually sunk in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in October 1944 alongside [[Kinu (Kancolle)|]].\r\n\r\nh4.

He loves chili dogs and rock music. He makes friends easily, but will equally not forgive anyone who threatens his friends and the world. His long-time nemesis is [[Dr. Eggman]], but they seem to uphold their rivalry on decent terms. Sonic can also change his form state, by collecting all 7 of the [[Chaos Emerald]]s and harnessing their positive energy to transform into Super Sonic; which bears a striking resemblance to a [[Super Saiyan]] from the [[Dragon Ball Z]] universe. This in turn grants him exponential speed and power increases, among flight abilities also making him immune to most attacks. \r\n\r\nSonic was designed and created by Japanese artist and game designer \"Oshima Naoto\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_%C5%8Cshima. He was initially codenamed \"Mr. Needlemouse\" during development as Sega's new mascot and was originally colored teal. His trademark blue pigmentation was chosen later to match Sega's cobalt blue logo. \"Uekawa Yuji\":http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Yuji_Uekawa provided the revamping of Sonic The Hedgehog's art style with the shift to the 3D era with the [[Sonic Adventure]] games around 1998.\r\n\r\nSonic replaced [[Alex Kidd (character)|Alex Kidd]] as the official mascot of [[SEGA]] Corporation since 1991.\r\n\r\nVoiced by Kanemaru Jun'ichi in Japan, and Jaleel White, Martin Burke, Ryan Drummond, Jason Griffith, and Roger Craig Smith in North America.\r\n\r\nh4.

The name SEGA comes from [b]SE[/b]rvice [b]GA[/b]mes.\r\n\r\nOriginally a maker of video [[game console]]s, it later shifted into just creating and publishing video games for other game consoles. However, in 2019 the company published a miniature version of their popular Sega Mega Drive console with several built-in games included.\r\n\r\nSEGA is the creator of the popular [[Sonic (series)|]] franchise.\r\n\r\nSince 2013, it is the parent company of fellow publisher [[Atlus]].\r\n\r\nSEGA was also a major [[arcade]] operator and owned several iconic arcades in Japan.  Due to declining income, especially caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, in 2022 they completely sold off their arcade operations division to GENDA Inc.  All remaining SEGA branded arcades to be rebranded with the \"GiGO\" logo (short for \"Get into the Gaming Oasis\").\r\n\r\nh4.

The scientific name of the plant is often linked to the myth of [[Narcissus]], who became so obsessed with his [[narcissism|own reflection]] in water that he drowned, although it is not clear whether the flower was named after the myth or the myth after the flower. The other common name is jonquil, after a particular species of the family.\r\n\r\nDaffodil flowers grow at about a right angle to the stem and have a cup- or trumpet-shaped protruding center surrounded by 6 petal-like tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals). The flowers may come in a limited variety of colors, most often white and yellow, sometimes orange. Depending on the species, the tepals may be a different color than the center.\r\n\r\nIn the east, they are considered a symbol of wealth and good fortune, and since they bloom in early spring are often associated with the Chinese New Year. The bulbs are mildly poisonous and must be handled with care but were once a part of traditional Japanese medicine.\r\n\r\nh4.

The project was not without its turbulence, as the mobile game ended its services in late 2016—just one month before the anime aired in early 2017, the first season of which was financially restricted, resulting in poor animation quality and mixed reviews from initial critics and viewers.\r\n\r\nDespite the 2015 game being closed down early—thus failing to give anime viewers context as had been planned—the anime was a surprise hit, due in no small part to scripting by director [[tatsuki (irodori)|Tatsuki]]; the show received very high ratings and viewership, miraculously reviving the dying franchise into a breakout success.\r\n\r\nh4.
