These adventures were continued by the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. The original series were influential in both the west and the east. In Japan it inspired the famous [[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]] classic anime series. \r\n\r\nFour more television series were eventually produced, based in the same universe but following other characters: [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]], following the crew of a new Starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] and [[Star Trek: Voyager]], set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise, set before the original series, in the early days of human interstellar travel. \r\n\r\nFour additional feature films were produced, following the crew of The Next Generation, and most recently a 2009 movie reboot of the franchise featuring the young crew of the original Enterprise set in an [[star trek: kelvin timeline|alternate timeline]]. \r\n\r\nThe newest Star Trek television revival, beginning in 2017, includes the series [[Star Trek: Discovery]], [[Star Trek: Picard|Picard]], Short Treks, [[Star Trek: Lower Decks|Lower Decks]], Prodigy, and [[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds|Strange New Worlds]], streaming on digital platforms.\r\n\r\nThe franchise also includes dozens of computer and video games, hundreds of novels, as well as a themed attraction in Las Vegas (closed in September 2008). Beginning with the original television series and continuing with the subsequent films and series, the franchise has created a cult phenomenon and has spawned many pop culture references.\r\nh4.

While his work was inspired by MGE, his writing eventually outgrew it. \r\n\r\nBobanon's content was most notable for containing darker content and deeper character development than other MGE works, and for being much longer.

His most well known character is probably Laska, a young orphan girl with many scars based on MGE's Cheshire Cat.

The war was mostly fought between differently-aligned communist nations: [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]], alighed with the [[Soviet|Soviet Union]], versus [[Cambodia]] and its ally [[China]]. It is therefore considered a proxy conflict of the Sino-Soviet Split.\r\n\r\nThe war began in late 1978 after the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in Cambodia carried out several raids into neighboring Vietnam, upon which the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] invaded Cambodia, deposed the Khmer Rouge, and then faced a decade-long guerilla struggle to destroy the remnants. In response to the invasion of their ally, China sent the [[People's Liberation Army]] into the northern provinces of Vietnam as a punitive expedition in February 1979. \r\n\r\nThe PLA withdrew from Vietnam in March of 1979, but the PAVN would be fighting in Cambodia until 1989, leading some Western commenters to call the conflict \"Vietnam's [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]]\". The conflict was finally ended by a peace agreement in 1991 and the restoration of Cambodian government in 1993.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was officially a conflict between North Vietnam, supported by the [[Soviet|Soviet Union]], [[China]] and other communist allies, and South Vietnam, supported by the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]] and other anti-communist allies. The war is therefore considered a [[Cold War]]-era proxy war.\r\n\r\nThe [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (known in the West by the insult \"Viet Cong\", or VC, meaning \"Red Vietnamese\"), a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North, fought a [[guerrilla]] war against anti-communist forces in the region, while the [[People's Army of Vietnam]], also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in more conventional warfare, at times committing large units to battle. Opposing them both was South Vietnam's [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]]. At the same time, communist-supported insurgencies fought against Western-supported governments in both Laos ([[Pathet Lao]]) and Cambodia ([[Khmer Rouge]]), and fighting in Vietnam frequently spilled over into those two countries. \r\n\r\nAmerican involvement in the war peaked in 1968, the same year that the communist side launched the [[Tet Offensive]]. The Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government, but became the turning point in the war, as it persuaded a large segment of the U.S. population that its government's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam. Direct U.S. military involvement in the region ended on 15 August 1973. \r\n\r\nThe capture of Saigon on 30 April 1975 by the North Vietnamese Army marked the end of the war in Vietnam, and North and South Vietnam were officially reunified the following year under a communist government. The Khmer Rouge and Pathet Lao also successfully took control of their respective countries in 1975. \r\n\r\nEstimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million. Some 240,000–300,000 Cambodians, 20,000–62,000 Laotians and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action. In addition, [[Third Indochina war|another conflict]] soon erupted between Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, China, and others in the region, lasting until 1991 and causing further destruction in the region. \r\n\r\nh4.

For posts which refer to the short story specifically, tag it with the mythos tag.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, Call of Cthulhu is the predominant TRPG (table talk RPG) of choice in the 21st century, over Dungeons and Dragons which previously dominated TRPG circles there, building off the TRPG fan culture tradition of 'replays' (novelizations of sessions, often paired with visuals to go with the text) with play videos (prerecorded or live) on Niconico and YouTube (ex. [[Yukkuri-tachi no Cthulhu no Yobikoe]]). Combined with general continued popularity for 20th century western authors such as Lovecraft, an accessible and easy-to-learn 'Basic Roleplaying' system which allows players to shape the scenarios as they wish (leading to many non-combat/horror-oriented scenarios), publisher support, player-created tools (such as CCFOLIA), and domestically-exclusive scenarios, CoC dominates. In turn, this has resulted in much fanart based on Japanese scenarios.\r\n\r\nh4. Call of Cthulhu-related tags\r\n\r\nh5.

Unlike the comics which were criticized for being an edgy comic about Superheroes who are secretly horrible, the show instead explores current topics like corporate greed, bigotry, extremism, abuse of power and celebrity culture. The second season aired in 2020, the third season in 2022 and the fourth season in 2024. A fifth and final season is currently in the works.\r\n\r\nThe show has three spin-offs. [b]The Boys Presents: Diabolical[/b] an animated anthology series that was released in 2022. \r\n\r\n[b]Gen V[/b], a spin-off set in The Boys universe that follows the students of Godolkin University, a special university for young Supes.

Also known as \"femboy\", or less frequently as \"tomgirl\".\r\n\r\nThe Japanese term 男の娘 ([i]otoko no ko[/i]) is a pun on 男の子 ([i]otoko no ko[/i]), meaning \"boy\", replacing 子 with the [i]ko[/i] reading of 娘 (commonly [i]musume[/i], girl).\r\n\r\nSome people use \"femboy\" to describe anyone who appears or acts feminine, even if they don't convincingly pass as female. If you can correctly tell the character is male with complete certainty from the thumbnail alone without looking at the genitalia, it's not this.\r\n\r\nWhile many traps engage in [[crossdressing]], it is not a requirement.

These games make up the [[Touhou (PC-98)]] era. In 2002 he returned as the one-man doujin group [i]Team Shanghai Alice[/i] and released Touhou for Windows, thus exposing it to a larger audience. \r\n\r\nThe games themselves, mostly in the [[danmaku]] (\"bullet hell\") genre, are addictive and have acquired a large following. In particular, his original music is incredibly popular and is the subject of numerous doujin remix albums.\r\n\r\nCurrently Touhou has twenty mainstream danmaku shooter games, six danmaku spinoffs, six fighting spinoffs and an action spinoff, with the fighting games and action game made in collaboration with Tasogare Frontier. The series also has a number of supplementary materials including manga, short stories, fanbooks, and music CDs.\r\n\r\nThe backgrounds and personalities of its characters (the majority of which come from the Windows generation) are often expanded upon in doujins and, occasionally, ZUN canonizes some concepts. \r\n\r\nTouhou is also notable for being a [i]de facto[/i] open source franchise, in which ZUN allows various fan works such as doujinshi and video games to be published and sold with little to no licensing fees. This allowed the franchise to remain popular to this day.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] Don't tag individual Touhou games unless the game is directly referenced by the post. All of the characters in a picture having debuted in the same game is not enough to count. The full cast of a game (with or without the protagonists) appearing will usually count, so long as no other characters are present.\r\n\r\nA \"Direct Reference\" can include, but may not be limited to:\r\n* Depiction of [[gameplay mechanics]] found in the game (post #4907093)\r\n* Any kind of [[parody]] of the game or other work (post #4546543)\r\n* A character drawn in a pose from their official art (post #4495699)\r\n* A character wearing an outfit from a game or other work instead of their \"usual\" outfit, ranging from outfits that only differ slightly (post #4419411), to outfits that differ entirely, (e.g [[Turbo Byakuren]]).
