He is also skilled at making sweets; for this reason, fans like to have the sweets-loving [[Houchou Toushirou]] approach him for food due to his parental aura.\r\n\r\nVoiced by Kawahara Yoshihisa.

Lusting for supernatural powers, despite being a multimillionaire already, Gustav channels the spirit of [[Goenitz]] into Sinobu Amou, the game's boss character, for use as his puppet. After Sinobu is defeated by the player, Gustav disappears without any explanation.\r\n\r\nGustav is much more infamously known due to his inclusion as the final boss of the [[M.U.G.E.N]]-developed King of Fighters fangame [i]The King of Fighters Memorial[/i]. Story-wise, Gustav hosts another King of Fighters tournament to get revenge on [[kusanagi_kyou|Kyo Kusanagi]] and [[yagami_iori|Iori Yagami]] for foiling his plans in EX2, requesting the help of his close assistant [[Psyqhical]]. With his monetary powers, Gustav manages to create clones of many major boss characters from the King of Fighters series, including [[Rugal Bernstein]], [[Krizalid]], [[zero_(kof)|both versions]] [[Original Zero|of Zero]], [[igniz_(kof)|Igniz]], and even Kyo and Iori themselves.\r\n\r\nGustav's appearance in [I]Memorial[/i] is heavily based off of [[oswald_(kof)|Oswald]]'s sprite sheet, therefore giving him very overdramatic poses. In-game, he is absurdly overpowered; being able to make use of infinite priority normals and projectiles, and full screen special attacks.\r\n\r\n[[Hei Meiling]] is an edit of him.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["グスタフ・ミュンヒハウゼン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":97761,"created_at":"2018-05-10T00:31:40.516-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-10T00:31:40.516-04:00","title":"gel_bulf","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ゲル・ブルフ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":97759,"created_at":"2018-05-10T00:04:13.164-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-10T00:04:13.164-04:00","title":"kobylkavpyzamu","body":"Female artist from the Czech Republic.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":97757,"created_at":"2018-05-09T23:38:22.482-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:38:22.482-04:00","title":"mikogami_matora","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["巳虎神マトラ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":97755,"created_at":"2018-05-09T23:37:59.982-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:37:59.982-04:00","title":"nimfpa","body":"Gender neutral artist from Wrocław, Poland.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":4870,"created_at":"2007-02-14T13:31:45.000-05:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:33:20.883-04:00","title":"milktank","body":"See [[gunner-l]].","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":10110,"created_at":"2009-02-13T04:55:28.751-05:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:29:43.635-04:00","title":"minomushi_(ocyakai)","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=550922\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":10299,"created_at":"2009-02-22T02:59:57.954-05:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:25:34.364-04:00","title":"kotoha","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=279589\r\n* Twitter account: https://twitter.com/ko_108621\r\n* Twitter account: https://twitter.com/kotoha621\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":46372,"created_at":"2013-05-31T12:34:22.702-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T23:19:42.339-04:00","title":"felicia-val","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=20005972\r\n* Pixiv account (dead): [s][nodtext]https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=316047[/nodtext][/s]\r\n* Deviantart account: http://felichanxx.deviantart.com\r\n* Tumblr account (unused): http://felipone.tumblr.com\r\n* Tumblr account (unused): http://mudaoras.tumblr.com\r\n* Twitter account (dead): [s][nodtext]https://twitter.com/crescential[/nodtext][/s]\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":97746,"created_at":"2018-05-09T21:57:11.935-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T21:57:11.935-04:00","title":"kuro_(kuro)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["黒"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":97743,"created_at":"2018-05-09T20:56:20.893-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T20:56:20.893-04:00","title":"little_alice_(wonderland_wars)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["リトル・アリス"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":10923,"created_at":"2009-04-02T05:43:33.538-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T15:25:54.441-04:00","title":"akinotsu-nako","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=490858\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":12075,"created_at":"2009-06-02T19:03:12.889-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T15:17:52.031-04:00","title":"aozoramikan","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=619315\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":12098,"created_at":"2009-06-04T20:12:39.081-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T15:16:18.425-04:00","title":"azakano","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=52953\r\n* Twitter account: https://twitter.com/hiyota_xsy\r\n* Drawr account: http://drawr.net/azakano\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":12316,"created_at":"2009-06-13T11:19:32.769-04:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T15:15:17.386-04:00","title":"yuuzo","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.See also\r\n\r\n* Pixiv account: https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=97713\r\n","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":15312,"created_at":"2009-11-23T07:13:47.230-05:00","updated_at":"2018-05-09T14:45:46.811-04:00","title":"rikudou_rinne","body":"Artist.\r\n\r\nh4.

It was introduced to women's fashion in the 16th century and was popular with both men and women in the 17th and 18th centuries. By the early 20th century, muffs were used in England only by women. It is also reported that the fashion largely fell out of style in the 19th century.\r\n\r\nIt briefly returned in the late 1940s and 1950s, and was also developed as a motorcycle accessory for attachment as rider-protection and comfort during the cooler months.\r\n\r\nh4.
