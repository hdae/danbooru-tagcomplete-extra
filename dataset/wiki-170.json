However like all girls in the team, Hinata also has deeper feelings for Subaru, and becomes slightly anxious if Subaru gets too close to other girls. Especially in Episode 4 and Episode 7 of first season, she eagerly wants to know if Subaru has feelings to her, when he \"confesses\" to Airi.\r\n\r\nBeing the elder one of the Hakamada sisters, Hinata cares about her little sibling, Kagetsu, very much.
