P. Lovecraft]] and his followers. \r\n\r\nIt was first mentioned in Lovecraft's 1924 short story \"The Hound\", written in 1922, though its purported author, the \"Mad Arab\" Abdul Alhazred, had been quoted a year earlier in Lovecraft's \"The Nameless City\". Among other things, the work contains an account of the [[elder_thing|Old Ones]], their history, and the means for summoning them. As such, it is considered a dangerous artifact that can be used as a gate to enable powerful beings from alternate lost dimensions of [[space]] to enter our world.\r\n\r\nOther authors such as August Derleth and Clark Ashton Smith also cited it in their works; Lovecraft approved, believing such common allusions built up \"a background of evil verisimilitude.\" Many readers have believed it to be a real work, with booksellers and librarians receiving many requests for it; pranksters have listed it in rare book catalogues, and even a student smuggled a card for it into the Yale University Library's card catalog.\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on the notoriety of the fictional volume, real-life publishers have printed many books entitled Necronomicon since Lovecraft's
