Their adult forms aren't well recognized, partially due to their relatively short life compared to their larval forms.\r\n\r\nWhile the origin of the name \"antlion\" isn't known, it is believed it stems from ants making up a large percent of their prey and for them being an aggressive hunter.  Their adult forms are sometimes referred to as \"antlion lacewings,\" and in North American their larva are sometimes referred to as \"doodlebugs\" due to the squiggling trails they can leave in sand.\r\n\r\nh4.

The game is set in 2035, where players control three humanoid androids in the wake of one murdering its owner, sparking a hunt for other \"deviant\" androids. [[connor_(detroit)|One]] is investigating other deviant androids following the murder in question alongside a [[hank_anderson|human partner]] distrustful of androids, [[kara_(detroit)|another]] has gone deviant and is trying to escape to Canada alongside a young girl after fleeing an abusive owner, and [[markus_(detroit)|a third]] has found itself at the forefront of a budding revolution alongside fellow deviant androids. The player's actions while controlling the characters have an impact on how the course of events in the game go and the ultimate outcome of the android revolution.","is_locked":false,"other_names":["Detroit:BecomeHuman","Detroitbecomehuman","底特律:化身为人","デトロイトビカムヒューマン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135336,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:30:37.306-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:30:37.306-05:00","title":"alice_williams","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["アリス・ウィリアムズ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135334,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:28:36.818-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:28:36.818-05:00","title":"r_daneel_olivaw","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["R・ダニール・オリヴォー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135333,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:27:58.881-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:27:58.881-05:00","title":"elijah_baley","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["イライジャ・ベイリ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135332,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:27:22.858-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:27:22.858-05:00","title":"simon_(detroit)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["サイモン"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135331,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:26:57.542-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:26:57.542-05:00","title":"north_(detroit)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ノース"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135330,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:26:32.110-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:26:32.110-05:00","title":"luther_(detroit)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ルーサー"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135329,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:26:02.515-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:26:02.515-05:00","title":"josh_(detroit)","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ジョッシュ"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135325,"created_at":"2022-01-22T06:21:55.183-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T06:21:55.183-05:00","title":"gavin_reed","body":"","is_locked":false,"other_names":["ギャビン・リード"],"is_deleted":false},{"id":135324,"created_at":"2022-01-22T05:37:57.854-05:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T05:37:57.854-05:00","title":"veiny_arms","body":"Arms that have visible vein lines, typically seen on muscular characters.","is_locked":false,"other_names":[],"is_deleted":false},{"id":114643,"created_at":"2020-07-09T16:38:48.951-04:00","updated_at":"2022-01-22T04:46:58.252-05:00","title":"claude_(housamo)","body":"\"Guild master of the Ikebukuro Guild and owner of the underground Colosseum, where Transients gather in an undisclosed, Ikebukuro-based location.
